CMV: Believing that everyone needs to go vegan while being an environmentalist is inconsistent.,X7123M3-256,0,"The belief that killing animals is wrong isn't the only reason to suggest we should avoid eating meat (I'm kind of a hypocrite here because I'm not a vegetarian, but whatever). When environmentalists argue in favour of veganism or vegetarianism, it often has to do with the inefficiency of raising animals for food. The argument is that it's unsustainable, with an ever increasing global population and large areas of natural habit The food fed to animals itself has to be grown, and often that's food that *could* be eaten directly by humans (this of course does not apply to livestock that graze on otherwise unusuable land). Feeding 1000kJ worth of grain to a cow does not get you 1000kJ worth of beef - most of that energy is simply burnt off by the cow. So you're using a lot more land, a lot more water, and a lot more pesticides to produce enough meat for one person, than to produce an equivalent amount of wheat. Also, methane emissions from livestock contribute to climate change."
CMV: Believing that everyone needs to go vegan while being an environmentalist is inconsistent.,Havenkeld,0,"Humans have separated themselves, to a certain extent, from nature, or at least hold such power over it that we become responsible for controlling natural environments to mitigate our own negative influences. Predator animals don't have so much choice in what they eat as humans, and without predators prey animals will overpopulate and starve themselves possibly after damaging/destroying environment by removing too much plant life. Humans do not need to be a part of this aside from mitigating our own influence, but to do so sometimes one option is to favor predator or prey if we've been reducing the populations of either - sometimes caused by hunting, sometimes protecting livestock, sometimes other factors. If humans were to freely hunt animals, many would simply go extinct in short order. Humans could replace natural predators, and often do, but it isn't essential to environmentalism I don't think. So believing everyone should be vegan isn't inconsistent with environmentalism, it can just be viewed as one method of mitigating unnecessary/harmful human influence on environment. You can argue it isn't the best thing for environmentalism though."

CMV: Believing that everyone needs to go vegan while being an environmentalist is inconsistent.,pfundie,0,"I'm not vegan (though I am vegetarian and I will explain why at the end of this post for clarity's sake), but I will do my best for this. 1) There are other bases for not wanting humans to eat meat other than moralizing arguments. An easy example is efficiency; you can feed a whole bunch less people with the space, time, and effort it takes to raise a cow compared to crops, and since most other animals don't have the capacity for agriculture it's hard to ask them to do it. 2) Humans are an invasive species and we shouldn't tamper with ecosystems more than is necessary, for our own survival. This ties into the previous argument, but all systems for getting meat are inherently more ecologically destructive than plant-based equivalents be it hunting-gathering or meat based agriculture-plant based agriculture. We've already wrecked a bunch, so we know it's possible, and we should probably be careful about wrecking any more through inherently inefficient practices. 3) You're picking the worst arguments to knock down. Sure, there are vegans and vegetarians alike who fall on the extreme ends of the spectrum and hold logically inconsistent beliefs, but you can find equivalents in any group, and I'm sure you don't want your groups characterized by the worst in them. It's best to argue against the best arguments you can find, both to better yourself and to better the community at large. I am vegetarian and not vegan because I don't think that I can say that the exploitation of animals is wrong so long as we as a species continue to exploit humans. I wear clothes produced by people living in poverty, so until that's fixed I think having all of the animal's needs filled in exchange for milk or eggs isn't the most pressing concern. As to why I don't eat meat: 1) It's inefficient for the reasons I outlined above. 2) Any meat source available to me at my low income probably is produced in terrible conditions, and is likely to be unhealthy as a result. I also don't think we should cause unnecessary suffering, even if people have an inbuilt craving for meat. Not to mention, much of America eats more meat than is even healthy for them. Not a reason to eat no meat, but certainly one to eat less. 3) Nutritional alternatives exist, are available nearly everywhere (at least in the U.S.), and are less expensive. When I look at the prices of even the cheapest meat it is several times more expensive than tofu, beans, eggs, and other protein sources, despite market forces. 4) I can cook (which is to say I can read off online recipes), so the food I make tastes much better than cheap restaurant or diner food even without meat. If you know how to use spices properly there's a whole world of delicious food out there that you simply don't need meat for. 5) A lot of this becomes irrelevant if we find an efficient process for lab-grown meat- I am all for this. I also support the development of GMOs, because I pay attention to science. 6) Finally, and I left this for last because I think this is probably the most controversial: Animals are probably sentient. Pretty much all scientific evidence points to it, and no human behavior can be qualitatively separated from animal behavior, from language to tool use. We're definitely the coolest, and probably the most complex animal, but strictly speaking there's nothing about us that merits treating all animals as lesser forms, that won't also force us to treat a superior alien or mechanical intelligence as a higher form. As an example, were we to create a superhuman machine intelligence in the next few decades, which looks decently likely, we would have to allow that it could morally view us the same way we morally view animals. I think any human would have problems with being treated like cattle, or the way we treat even other primates."
CMV: Believing that everyone needs to go vegan while being an environmentalist is inconsistent.,SpoonLightning,0,"I think the difference is that animal suffering resulting from farming and hunting is our fault. By eating meat, it is your fault that animals are suffering. But in nature, it's not human's fault. It's like how you are morally obligated to not murder, but are not morally obligated to try to prevent every human from dying."
CMV: Believing that everyone needs to go vegan while being an environmentalist is inconsistent.,gofflaw,0,"I think you're reducing the idea of veganism to the point of absurdity. Believing that humans, who are uniquely moral agents, shouldn't kill or exploit animals, is a long way away from demanding that non-moral agents (animal predators) should not either. There'd be an immediate paradox if they did: most predators *need* to eat other animals to survive, so somehow disallowing them from doing so would mean effectively killing them. The vegan argument is that humans don't *need* to kill or exploit animals, *and* we're unique among the animal kingdom in that we have a universal empathy with beings that can suffer, and so doing so represents an unnecessary infliction of suffering."
CMV: Believing that everyone needs to go vegan while being an environmentalist is inconsistent.,neviss,0,"I think ecological and vegan ethics can be rather easily combined if you replace the utilitarian standpoint to rights based one. For many vegans using animals is bad because we exploit sentient beings. It does not only have to do with suffering (although when animals are commodified, that is most often the case), for example we also modify their genetics to better serve our purposes (think how wrong it would seem to do this to humans) Because we as humans are in a power position (weapons, skills, knowledge) it makes basically all hunting / breeding and other animal - human relationships exploitative and might eventually lead to animal suffering (in the long term). Knowingly exploiting sentient beings for our purpose is the main thing being wrong then, of which suffering is the outcome. You could say that in the nature the exploitation aspect is less prevalent, as most animals are codependent and do not have the power to choose whether or not to kill - mostly the predators just have instincts for that. Although sentient beings are killed, in the same time the predators act according to their genetically determined ethology. To deny the predators the killing of other animals would mean to change their behaviour according to our own perception. For example, we would probably need to limit their freedom of movement, give food they do not enjoy eating and do other things we might easily label as exploitative. And even if we wanted to make utilitarian style tradeoff, we might end up exploiting the prey animals as well, as we would remove the threats that they are naturally adapted to and most likely introduce new ones (starvation, illnesses) they might as well experience as equally disturbing. To take the analogy - it would probably seem wrong to keep the humans in controlled cages and provide them food and other needs just so that we can avoid potential violence and save lives. In the end, since we have done so much harm to wildlife, we might even reintroduce predators, to reverse the exploitative effects we have had on both prey and predator animals and bring them back to the previous long term situation they are genetically adapted to. In short, both veganism and deep ecology want to stop the exploitation of nature, especially the sentient animals."
CMV: Believing that everyone needs to go vegan while being an environmentalist is inconsistent.,freegan4lyfe,0,"I think you're a bit correct that being vegan and being a conservationist is a bit hypocritical. But I don't see the value in discrediting veganism. Rather, I see it as helping to make more vegans care about wild animal suffering. I personally am vegan, care about global warming and its effects on humans, but also dislike """"nature"""" for all of the cruelty and suffering it represents. Does that make me consistent? Maybe. It also suggests that your argument is a bit of a strawman of sorts."
CMV: Believing that everyone needs to go vegan while being an environmentalist is inconsistent.,qtj,0,"The most common argument for veganism I see, is that humans today with modern agriculture do not need animal products to survive and therefore shouldn't exploit animals to aquire those. I do not see how this contradicts with loving nature. Cruelty is a necessary part of nature. It isn't necessary for humans to be cruel to animals and they should therefore avoid it. This doesn't mean that people have to step into nature and make it cruelty free."
CMV: Believing that everyone needs to go vegan while being an environmentalist is inconsistent.,shadowfriend1,0,"I'm not vegan myself, but I can understand the rationale. If I understand your argument correctly, you ultimately say that because animals are killing each other all the time in nature, humans should not be held to a higher standard. Consider this: natural disasters kill humans all of the time. However, if I killed someone, saying that they could just have easily been killed by a volcano is not a sound defense. Why? Because as humans, we oppose nature all of the time. It's how we built societies. There are plenty of awful things that nature does that we don't condone; things that we actively fight against, even if they are happening all around us outside of our control (like my example above). From a vegan perspective, this battle against nature is extended to us not harming animals."
CMV: Believing that everyone needs to go vegan while being an environmentalist is inconsistent.,SKazoroski,0,"Predator animals include more than just the obvious lions and tigers and bears. It encompasses anything in any [food web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_web) that sustains itself by eating other animals. The whale that eats krill is a predator. The bird that eats worms is a predator. Spiders are predators of the insects they catch in their webs. Any fish that doesn't just eat either algae or kelp is a predator. Hell, even [plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivorous_plant) can be predators. There are so many predators that getting rid of them all or making them not be predators would have serious consequences."
CMV: Believing that everyone needs to go vegan while being an environmentalist is inconsistent.,Cyberpunk_Is_Now,0,"&gt;The most common argument is that predator animals need to eat other animals to survive. (Note that not all of them do.) This, of course, ignores that prey animals need to avoid being eaten to survive. To use this as an argument implies that we should prioritize an animal that requires killing animals to survive over an animal that doesn't. And in turn, this argument ignores that without predators to keep their numbers in check, the prey animals will overpopulate and out-breed their food sources, and then more will die of starvation. &gt;Many vegans are okay with reintroducing predators to an ecosystem. This makes no sense to me because they are supporting actions that deliberately result in killing animals, while saying it's wrong to kill animals. They may say predation is necessary to the ecosystem and to let other animals thrive, but they would have a problem with humans hunting, and that doesn't explain why the ecosystem should be restored in the first place. The difference is that predators either A) don't have the ability to eat and digest plant life (side-note: don't ever try to put your cat on a vegan diet, it will kill them slowly and painfully), and/or B) don't have the ability to know that they're causing suffering by killing. Animals aren't moral agents, and can't know that killing is wrong. We do, and should rise above our urge to eat meat, since most humans can absolutely live off of a plant-based diet. &gt;Animals cannot be held to moral standards, so we can't judge them the same way as ourselves. However, it's perfectly possible to oppose harm that has no moral agent, such as in the case of a fire. Putting out a fire would not morally judge one. Refer back to the first argument. Fire isn't alive, but still plays important parts in ecosystems; often we'll create brush fires to allow things to burn off, rather than a raging inferno that will kill people and animals. Trying to preserve as much life as we can is a balancing act. It's the combination of the fact that they are alive and that they have no alternative way of maintaining that life and that it would be crueler to let prey animals starve and that it would be impractical to leave culling to hunters entirely and that they have no moral agency... all of that together is what reconciles predators into exclusion from the rules about killing. (Of note here: I'm not a vegan myself, but playing devil's advocate.)"
CMV: Animal rights groups should stop assuming animals share the same values as humans,Morthra,1,I'll also bring up that PETA =/= all animal rights activist groups. PETA is the only one I've heard of that believes that animals should have the same rights as humans (and that owning a pet is morally wrong). Anecdotally most of the animal rights groups I've run into are more focused on the factory farming industry and how it's cruel towards the animals and damaging to the environment.
CMV: Animal rights groups should stop assuming animals share the same values as humans,hoydor,0,"Animals don't understand morality but they can feel pain and discomfort, they are aware of their environment, they choose better things and avoid harm when possible, they have more complex minds than humans below certain age. Most animals wouldn't cause any harm to us if not provoked and they don't need to sign an agreement for that. We are the ones causing harm based on the false assumption that we are superior. If our morality applies only to beings who are capable of understanding it then it should work both ways. If they can't benefit from it, they shouldn't suffer from it."
CMV: Animal rights groups should stop assuming animals share the same values as humans,orphancrack,0,"Putting animals in captivity is the position that actively aims to make an animal's decision for it. Saying animals should not be held captive is the positive that leaves them be to do their thing as they see fit. The idea that allowing animals to go live their lives as they would is """"imposing"""" something on animals is nonsense. So the natural order of things is making tigers jump through hoops? This is what you see as an acceptance of """"well, we just don't know what animals actually want""""? You've got it quite backwards; captivity is the current status quo but that does not make it the default. The default position for """"we don't know what animals want so we cannot respond to their wants"""" is to do nothing to or with them. The main tenet of most animal rights movement is this: animals are not ours. They do not belong to us. They exist for their own reasons, and we may or not not understand those reasons, but it is not our right to treat them as if they are ours and they exist for our reasons. Most animal rights groups, but not all, would make some exceptions for species that depend on humans due to extensive evolutionary connections (dogs and cats, for example). However we are still required to care for them."

CMV: Animal rights groups should stop assuming animals share the same values as humans,chubacca84,0,"You are right. Animals should decide for themselves. However, they can't make those decisions. How would they communicate whether they want to be free or captive? How would a captive-born animal communicate it wants to be free when it no longer suited that animal halfway through captivity? We don't know. As I see it, animal rights concern humans as much as animals. Humans have to approach nature without ownership. Although releasing a captive-born animal into the wild might be more """"cruel"""", all animals (and humans) can experience """"cruelty"""" in the chaotic, non-controlled environment. Cruelty is already an anthropomorphic way of viewing animal/human relationship. Without any way of knowing what an animal feels, we can only approach this theoretically and philosophically. In the practical world, people take the middle ground and release animals only if they are somewhat capable of survival."
CMV: Animal rights groups should stop assuming animals share the same values as humans,GnosticTemplar,0,"Inclined to agree, but animals share at least the bottom tiers of Maslow's hierarchy with humans. They want their basic survival needs met, in addition to social bonds (in the case of social animals) and mental stimulation/momentary autonomy doing the things they love. Attempts to project the upper tiers onto animals are a lost cause, because animals are not capable of introspection or other abstract reasoning, at least anywhere near on the level of humans. Dogs are a special case, demonstrating exactly where PETA and other """"animal liberation"""" groups go wrong. Through the miracle of domestication and selective breeding, dogs and humans evolved together in a symbiotic, mutually social relationship. If you point at an object, the dog will understand your gesture calling attention to it. Dogs prefer to eat their omnivorous masters' table scraps, and sleep in their masters' bedroom. They can read human body language better than many humans, and will lick your face at first sign of distress. They experience separation anxiety when home alone. In short, dogs love us and we love them. The reality of """"liberating"""" them would result in the weaker dogs dying off while the stronger ones hunt more often but still hang around human settlements. To eliminate the human-canine bond would require nothing short of genocide. Thar being said, dogs do hold some questionable morality.They have no such concept as sexual consent apart from attacking unwanted mates. They enjoy the sound of squeaky toys because it reminds them of their prey's death cries. They'll disobey orders, bark at 20 decibels, and hurt themselves for negative attention. They literally eat bones to sharpen their teeth. They have little problem killing and torturing small animals because that's what their ancestors did. They'll bark at black people if they've only ever been around whites. They'll shit on the neighbor's lawn to chagrin of both the neighbor, his dog, and you having to clean it up. Females bearing a litter will practice post-birth abortion by culling the runt. Due to the way their limited memory works, they literally can't feel guilt or remorse outside the immediate moment being caught in the act and scolded. (Sorry to ruin a thousand """"guilty dog"""" videos for you - dogs can't comprehend guilt or shame.)"
CMV: Animal rights groups should stop assuming animals share the same values as humans,stcamellia,0,"A similar CMV was here a few days ago. For many animal ethicists it's not so much about animal welfare as it's abour the lack of consent. Farmed animals do not consent to the capture, conditions and death that ensue. Yes, to some degree zoology, veterinarian science and common sense dictate certain """"comforts"""" and ideal conditions for an animal, but for some activists this is moot."

CMV: Animal rights groups should stop assuming animals share the same values as humans,BirdsAndBirdies,0,"I think animals with lower levels of intelligence might not mind (i.e. the butterfly exhibit at the zoo). They would be in an environment with a steady food supply, and no predator threat. But you could also argue that they are not even aware of their situation. But more intelligent animals can get very stressed out by a captive environment (i.e. the elephant exhibit at the zoo), which you can infer that they would rather not be in captivity. Can you provide any examples of this view your arguing against? It's a bit unclear to be honest. What anthropomorphic ideals are being imposed on animals?"
CMV: Animal rights groups should stop assuming animals share the same values as humans,elliptibang,0,"I don't think it really has anything to do with preferences or """"values."""" Take captivity for example. It may be true that some animals don't mind being held in captivity. That may also be true of some human beings. If it doesn't seem to you like a person minds being held in captivity, does that mean it's okay for you to lock that person up without his or her permission? You could easily argue that it's ethically wrong to deprive an innocent conscious being of its freedom, regardless of whether or not said freedom is actively missed. &gt;Second, even within species there are different personalities between individuals. You cannot assume all animals of x species feel one way about something. Can you explain how this is relevant?"
CMV: Animal rights groups should stop assuming animals share the same values as humans,Slipguard,0,"I think the most convincing argument for me was that the right of an animal is to have the option to exercise its natural instincts, and in human captivity, we are responsible for those rights. Cows to gather in herds, choose their food source, and roam. Dogs to run and play and hunt (even in simulated form) and be with other dogs. Chickens to... whatever chickens do. Anyway, current animal captivity practices don't take into account things that are important for the health and well-being of animals. Industrialized farming only makes such decisions on profit-based merits. Pet ownership only restricts such things as can be proven to be outright abuse. Animal rights activists would argue that animals are something neither person nor property, and currently we treat them as property. For example, say a couple wants a dog. They live in an apartment with a park within walking distance, but both adults work, and neither has the time to walk the dog all day. If they got a large dog, which needs to run around for at least 1-4 hours a day, it would be cruel to neglect the animal and keep them cooped up all day in an apartment, so it should be mandatory for the couple to either find the time or some service to take care of that dog. We already have laws that punish people for outright abuse of a dog, or for an abusive level of neglect, and people will say when you ask them that their pets are like members of their family. Animal rights activists would say that we should at least extend the kinds of protections we have for prisoners to the animals in our captivity as well."
CMV: Animal rights groups should stop assuming animals share the same values as humans,Genomixologist,1,"I agree with you to an extant, but because we can't speak to animals we will never be able to determine exactly how they feel about things. This has led to best practices in animal care and treatment to generally mirror best practices in human treatment, although obviously to a lessor degree. I'm a veterinary student, so I deal with and will be dealing with this issue a lot. This comes up quite a bit in discussions about pain control drugs. We often can't tell for sure which drugs work best or exactly how much we're helping because animals A) can't speak and B) are generally very good at hiding how much pain they're in. One extreme example is reptile pain. For some reason reptiles will often exhibit zero signs of pain despite incredibly painful stimuli being inflicted, like a snake will just sit on a hot pad until it gets third degree burns, or it might ignore a rat in its cage that eats all the way through its torso. We know they have a neurologic system very similar to ours, we can track their nociceptive feedback and see that it exists, but for some reason they just don't exhibit pain in quite a few scenarios that should be very painful. Some people think that means that snakes shouldn't be given pain control if they look fine, but most veterinarians will tell you that in this kind of a situation it's always better to err on the side of caution, and they will give pain medication if there is a case where you would expect pain in a mammal or avian. Animals share, for the most part, extremely similar biology. The similarity between a human and a dog for example in terms of physiology is extremely high, most drugs work the same on both of them despite highly specific effects. We have good reason to start with the assumption that what bothers humans bothers animals, and then only move away from that if evidence appears to the contrary."
CMV: Animal rights groups should stop assuming animals share the same values as humans,bad__hombres,0,"The idea of """"captivity"""" is entirely a human value, though. Animals don't capture other species and confine them to certain spaces so if you're arguing that humans should stop trying to impose human values and ideals on animals, then you should be against animal captivity.

"CMV: Taken to its logical conclusion, vegans shouldn't be avoiding meat. They should be eating cats.",DCarrier,0,"There's more to it than that. If we adopt cats to kill and eat them, humans will see this, be offended by it, dislike vegans in general, and be less likely to cut down on meat. This will result in more factory farming. If it were socially acceptable, then maybe. Although there's other problems. Being eaten alive isn't the best way to go. Especially the way that cats do it. But it's still likely better than a slow death by starvation, which predators can help prevent. If animal shelters gave away the meat from animals they put down, then the only problem would be that if you eat it someone else won't and they might eat a different kind of meat, but I think it would be fine. But at that point, your entire argument is irrelevant, since they'd be killing the animals anyway."
"CMV: Taken to its logical conclusion, vegans shouldn't be avoiding meat. They should be eating cats.",DHCKris,0,I don't think that any vegans believe in minimizing harm to such a ludicrously pedantic degree. Vegans merely believe in a refusal to participate in a system with which they disagree.
"CMV: Taken to its logical conclusion, vegans shouldn't be avoiding meat. They should be eating cats.",RajonRondoIsTurtle,0,"I think there is a big problem with scale here. The scale on which cats contribute to the destruction of the ecosystem and factory farming contributes to global climate change are simply not comparable. Sure cats kill loads and loads of birds, but factory farming is a huge contributor to climate change which literally drives species into extinction. Also why do the cats have to be eaten? We control animal populations all the time without eating more of the problem animal."
"CMV: Taken to its logical conclusion, vegans shouldn't be avoiding meat. They should be eating cats.",relljr,0,You're only debating one reasons why vegans are vegan.

"CMV: Taken to its logical conclusion, vegans shouldn't be avoiding meat. They should be eating cats.",HigHog,0,"Broadly speaking there are two camps of veganism. One believes that we should not use animal products at all (and so obviously would not agree with eating cats). The other, more common one, believes that we should reduce human exploitation of animals as far as is practically possible. In the Western world at least, humans generally do not need to consume animal products to be healthy, hence the dietary aspects of veganism. Cats killing birds does not directly involve human exploitation, while hunting cats would - therefore eating cats would not logically be a result of veganism. However, many vegans are concerned with conservation and so would recognise a need to control invasive/feral cat populations. This could be through spay/neuter programs, or even culls, but I think most vegans would believe this should be under governmental control with scientific advice. Either way, this is a result of a general concern for animal life rather than a directly stemming from a vegan ethos, and does not involve themselves having to eat cats."
"CMV: Taken to its logical conclusion, vegans shouldn't be avoiding meat. They should be eating cats.",selfdownvoterguy,0,"Why should they eat the cats? Would the presumed net gain from killing a feral cat not be met by feeding the cat to a scavenger? Vultures are carnivores but they don't actively hunt, but rather they feed from the remains of the already dead. I don't see a logical conclusion for vegans to eat any animal products even when following your argument. Furthermore, Why would you expect vegans to spend the time and resources to go out and actively seek and kill cats? I think, as a matter of efficiency, vegans are better off making positive impacts by avoiding the animal products markets. If they are willing to put effort into killing predatory animals, Why don't they instead try to sabotage mass production farms and potentially make a bigger impact than killing a few cats?"

It's a great point, but many do it for environmental or health reasons. I try to eat a lot of vegan meals myself for those last two reasons. If we started eating cats, an industry would develop. Maybe we'd rid ourselves of cats for a while, but then we'd just develop a taste for cat meat that probably already exists elsewhere. Plenty of other places eat other meats. We consider horse to be untouchable but there's no real reason (other than it's stringy). If cats are harmful, a quick death would be better.

If prex populations were allowed to grow unchecked, they would soon outgrow their ecological boundaries: food would become scarce, many prey animals would starve. You'd just have exchanged one type of harm for another. [see also](https://cheetah.org/2011/05/why-are-predators-important/) So, actually eating feral cats (reducing their number) would simply not have noticeable effect on the ecosystem, and it is doubtful that suffering of small animals as a whole would be reduced by it."

One expected outcome of veganism is a reduction of the total amount of suffering. But 'reducing the total amount of suffering in the universe' is not an accurate description/summary of veganism.

The way we see it is that there is no trait that is absent in animals that if absent in humans would justify killing humans for food. If you cannot name a that trait the your position is logically inconsistent. We shouldn't have to justify why we aren't eating animals, you just justify why you think it's okay to cause sentient beings to suffer **needlessly**"

They should be eating cats.",ThatSpencerGuy,0,"This is an interesting position, and it seems as though there **is** a reasonable (if improbable!) case to be made for killing and eating domestic cats. If this is all in the name of a fun thought-experiment, well done! But if it is meant as a serious response to a person's dietary decision, I do have a point I want to make: There is basically *no* moral position that anyone takes to its extreme logical conclusion in their actual life. People often fail to perfectly inhabit the moral positions they earnestly hold. And that's OK. Some vegans have leather interiors in their cars. Some use products that were tested on animals. It doesn't make them hypocrites or their diets affectations. For example, I think it is a good thing to be financially responsible and live within my means. But I reliably fail to do this all the time. I buy stupid things that I don't really need and can't afford. But I don't totally give up on the project of being frugal just because I'm not perfect at it, and I don't abandon the principle. Similarly, I think that eating animals is morally wrong, and so I try hard to eat fewer animals. In fact, I try hard to eat *zero* animals. But what if I ate Thanksgiving turkey every year? Would that make the whole project pointless? I don't think so. And so while the case for eating cats is an interesting and semi-persuasive one closely tied to the reasons for being vegan, I want to emphasize that the argument you make **doesn't** imply that if vegans aren't willing to eat cats, they may as well not be vegans at all. Anyway, again, this may all be beside your point. But it's something I wanted to add to the discussion. Good post, OP!"

It's about being anti factory farming which is far more brutal than death imo. It's also about saving the environment. Factory farming is a huge contributor to climate change and is incredibly inefficient protein-wise compared to being vegetarian/vegan. Additionally, it's very rarely ethical to impose your ideology onto others by force. Going out of your way to kill cats wouldn't fix the structural issues that vegans/vegetarians want to address."

I was a vegetarian for a long time, mostly because the horror of factory farming. I would argue that factory farms do increase harm to the world. It's pretty clear that animals suffer - if we can reduce that by not promoting factory farming that is a good thing (good defined as; there are less beings suffering that are capable of suffering). Killing cats to prevent them from killing other creatures a bit a of a Trolley problem, but without moral agency they shouldn't be held to the same standard as a human being."

Clearly, then, the issue is whether a vegetarian diet *minimizes* these effects significantly more than an omnivorious diet. Even when adjusted for field-mice-per-acre, it absolutely does.

This is really the statement that has to be true for your argument to mean anything. Yes, if every vegetarian switched to eating free-range, grass-fed beef raised on small farms the market share of ethical meat would increase, but only because the market as a whole got bigger. It wouldn't actually decrease the suffering or numbers of a single factory farmed animal; it would just result in more animals being eaten overall. So unless it's better for an animal to be raised eaten than to have never existed (which, to be fair, is arguable if the animal led a happy life), this can't really be said to help animal welfare in a meaningful sense. The point that it's easier to shift to eating ethically raised meat to full-on vegetarianism I agree with. It's certainly better to eat ethically raised meat than factory farmed meat. But I don't see how people who are currently vegetarians starting to eat meat does anything to change the opinions of people who don't particularly care about animal welfare, which is what would need to happen to actually cause a shift away from eating factory farmed meat to ethically raised meat. You could give the arguments for why eating factory farmed meat is immoral and present this alternative without needing to actually eat meat yourself."

Dramatic societal changes have happened multiple times throughout history. They are gradual and at times may seem impossible to many, but they do happen. The larger issue is that you are somehow concluding that someone choosing to go vegan gives more demand to large factory farms. You are correct that it may reduce the demand for meat from *slightly* less cruel farms, but it also takes demand away from the larger farms. Going vegan means fewer animals suffer on small farms and fewer animals suffer on factory farms, not that fewer animals suffer on small farms and more animals suffer on factory farms."
CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are not the best way to improve farm animal welfare,hatesdefaultfrontpag,0,"Vegan and vegetarian diets create demand for meatless alternatives on every scale: to almost every supermarkets selling Boca Burgers and almond milk, to fast food chains like Burger King and Subway offering veggie patties, and to office functions that offer vegetarian options for their employees and clientele. Since I became a vegetarian almost a decade ago, there has been an enormous, consciousness raising, proliferation in vegetarian options for everyone. It is part of the reason why you are even aware of us to even bother sharing this apologia as a reaction against this sea change. At this point, someone who ate only ethically sourced meat from places that allowed you open access to how they raise and slaughter their animals would restrict their diet so much that they would be far more like vegetarians than most Americans: that means no Big Macs, or hot dogs, or almost any form of meat that is convenient and readily available. It is a far more principled stance than most people realize. And in a lot of ways it is more elitist than a vegetarian diet: it would be like someone who only buys their clothes from local manufacturers telling others to stop buying anything made from a sweat shop (but worse since we can survive without meat but not clothes). I am not necessarily against the consumption of animal flesh or cow's milk, but I recognize that the scale on which we produce it, and the entire industrial factory farming complex, is far too large and entrenched in our economic system for us to frame this as anything other than a rights based issue. I believe that no animal, whether they are human or non-human should be reduced to mere property, just so we can continue to exploit them """"inhumanely"""". And they absolutely are considered property under the law. The USDA offers no federal guidelines on animal welfare relating to """"agriculture"""". In fact, there are federal laws in place that can prosecute people who disrupt factory farming through non-violent ways as terrorists merely for taking videos of their practices (e.g. Ag-gag laws). A vegetarian or vegan does not necessarily change these laws or give legal consideration to non-human animals by virtue of forgoing meat, but it is necessarily step to the ideological paradigm shift that would even allow for something like that to be considered as a viable alternative. It should be less of """"thou shall not kill"""" and more """"thou shall not make killable"""", and how you parse out something like that is culturally and socially dependent. You do not have to think the whole world needs to stop eating meat just because our system of producing it is so morally grotesque."

People will always want meat and the market will always provide it. Vegan that truly believes that they are directly helping animals by not eating meat are deluding themselves. You are correct on this point. So why do vegans decide to be vegans, if not to directly help animals? Most vegans eat their burgers without beef because they want to make a statement. """"I believe that animals are being treated cruelly. because of this, I will not eat meat."""" It's a bit like not going to a restaurant because they came out against a belief of yours.

I think it's safe to assume that any person (and most, if not all, farmed non-human animals can and should be considered persons in the philosophical sense) cannot be meaningfully said to have a happy existence if that person is 1. kept captive from birth until death, 2. killed at a young age instead of being allowed to live healthfully as long as possible, and 3. forced to bear children that will have the same kind of existence. There is no way that current rates of producing animal flesh and secretions for human consumption can possibly continue if these three assumptions are not met. In particular, the only way to eliminate point (3) is to reduce demand. Otherwise, people must breed animals in order to ensure that supply meets demand. So my point is that your fifth assumption is totally invalid. You can't possibly claim that killing a cow at a quarter of their natural lifespan is in any sense ethical -- not if that killing was unnecessary. And it was unnecessary, because there is a scientific consensus \[[1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864), [2](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx), [3](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx), [4](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition), [5](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/), [6](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html), [7](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf), [8](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446), [9](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)\] that every man, woman, and child is perfectly capable of living their entire lives without consuming animal products. So there is *no such thing* as an ethical farm. There are only less unethical farms. The only way to eliminate the economic forces that make farms inherently unethical is to reduce demand. That has to start with you. By going vegan, you do two things. You eliminate the demand that comes from you, and you demonstrate to other less-informed people that the vegan lifestyle is practicable. Final note: I am fully aware that meat is tasty, but taste preferences are not an ethical justification for killing innocents. Stop killing innocent creatures just because you like how they taste.

Additionally, vegans also don't consume milk or honey, neither of which are potential lives the same way that a fertilized egg would be. They don't consume them for the same reason as eggs - they view it as enslavement of an animal."

There are also much more serious consequences to bringing an unwanted child into the world relative to the consequences of not eating animals (in fact reducing our consumption of animal-products has even more positive consequences).

"CMV: If you are a vegan, you have to be pro-life.",Salanmander,0,"&gt; How can they believe that it is morally wrong to eat eggs as they will become life I think that's not the actual argument used. That wouldn't apply to cheese, for example, which vegans also abstain from, and also doesn't even apply to most eggs, because they're usually unfertilized. I think the argument in your last paragraph *is* the main one, actually. Typically the argument is that the creation of animal products for human use exploits the animals, leading to increased suffering for the animals. In fact, many people who are vegan for moral reasons would be fine with animals products that don't kill the animal (including eggs) *if* they could be sure that humane farming practices were used."

"CMV: If you are a vegan, you have to be pro-life.",bguy74,1,"The equivalent position would be that - and I suspect this is true - the vegan does not women to be held in farms and then impregnated and then their fetuses removed to be sold as food. It's the holding of the life in bondage for the purpose of human food that is objectionable to those who hold the moral position you put out here. If corn grew eggs that turned into chickens then vegans might eat them. More importantly, it is not a claim of the vegan that they can't kill a chicken if it were to crawl up inside their body. The vegan doesn't deny the right to self-defense, to domain over owns own body, and so on. Additionally, many people are vegans on grounds that _are_ moral, but not about killing. They can be about the environment, or they can be for a multitude of reasons that combine. You strawman a choice the vegan makes by insisting their motivation be singular."
"CMV: If you are a vegan, you have to be pro-life.",MPixels,0,"The reason they can't eat eggs isn't that they're chicken foetuses. Firstly, it's because they are the product of the exploitation of an animal. Secondly, eggs are not chicken foetuses. They're almost always unfertilised eggs."
"CMV: If you are a vegan, you have to be pro-life.",minerva_qw,0,"There are many reasons that vegans don't eat eggs, but them being fetuses or potential life is not one of them. It is out of concern for the wellbeing of existing chickens in the egg industry (sources available upon request): 1. Male egg laying chicks are disposed of shortly after hatching because they can't lay eggs and it's not profitable to raise them for meat. 2. Egg laying hens are slaughtered when their egg production diminishes, well before the end of their natural lifespans. 3. 99% of eggs come from factory farms, where hens live short lives in cramped, unsanitary conditions and are routinely subjected to cruel and stressful practices that prioritize their production capability over their wellbeing. In fact, I think that most vegans would consider it quite merciful if chickens were not bred and born into the cruel conditions of the egg industry. We commandeer chickens' reproductive systems for our own benefit, and opposing this practice is fully compatible with supporting human women's rights to have full control over their reproductive choices."
Please CMV: I have no problem whatsoever with animal cruelty,whattodo-whattodo,0,"&gt; (1) I understand most people are offended when animals get hurt,... &gt; (2) I do not condone killing species of animals recklessly... In both of your examples on where you would *not* hurt animals it seems that the animals carry an *instrumental value*. They are either ecologically necessary, helpful to humans or you see human emotions tethered to their pets. I notice that in your view, animals don't have an *intrinsic value*. What it comes down to is empathy. You are able to understand the suffering of a human and without needing to be told, you would prefer not to be the cause of that suffering. Without asking more questions it is very hard to see why you do not feel the same way about animals. Though, in honesty I doubt that there is much in the way of changing your view. I mean this in the most clinical way possible, but there are a lot more sociopaths in America than people realize. Most of them don't set out to hurt anyone, they're just indifferent to the pain. So long as you're aware of the law and people around you are aware of your limits (or lack thereof) you should get along fine. As for people feeling hurt by your lack of empathy, it just comes with the territory. EDIT: I am not a therapist and I do not know if you are a sociopath. I am in no position to apply that label. These are the tendencies that in my opinion most closely match one and therefore I suggest the same resolution as is available to that group."

I believe that animal has more of a right to life and safety than the owner has to their sick pleasure, or their right to exercise ownership over the creature.

Please CMV: I have no problem whatsoever with animal cruelty,littlecreamsodapop,0,"I believe there are 2 sides to this question, the rational and the emotional side. Emotionally you either feel empathic towards animals, or you dont, and as /u/badkeymachine pointed out, you cant change that through arguments. I would like to add that empathy means more than finding an animal """"cute"""" or seeing oneself in its place. Rationally it gets a bit more complicated. Say you really dont feel any empathy towards animals other than humans (which i find hard to believe), as you pointed out yourself it is still a smart thing to not harm them in order to protect your social status, since other people may have created a bond with those animals. Other than that and the conservation of species there are no rational reasons for you to not torture/harm animals, which is why many people silently support it by buying cheap meat. However, if you do feel any sort of emotional connection to an animal, i belive it could do great harm to your own psyche if you were to harm it unnecessarily. On the other hand building a relationship with an animal like a dog can give you both great joy in life, aswell as insights into yourself since the dog could show you a completely different way of perceiving the world and making decisions. Personally, I think there is a certain beauty to every living thing, regardless of its perceived """"cuteness"""", and that makes me want to protect it, or at the very least not harm it."
Please CMV: I have no problem whatsoever with animal cruelty,valkyriav,0,"But animals are capable of complex emotions and they certainly can feel pain. You can see them feel fear and that can be captured in a brain scan. Their brains are not all that different than a human's, even if they are simpler. So they probably won't start thinking about the meaning of life, but they certainly will feel fear and pain, and get traumatized. You have chimps and parrots who reached the intelligence and communication level of a young child. If you are ok with them being tortured and experimented on in a painful way, then you should be ok with doing so on a young child. """"Ah"""", you say, """"but the child will eventually turn into a full adult"""". What if they won't? What if the young child will 100% die of cancer within the next year? Is it ok to torture them for amusement then? What about for experiments or cosmetic testing? The wrongness of the act is on a scale, of course. Some animals have more complex brains than others, and they are capable of understanding their surroundings and feeling fear and pain in a stronger way, so hurting them is more wrong than others. Insects for instance don't have a nervous system and don't really feel pain, so it's not really that bad to kill them. It is less wrong to hurt a dog than it is to hurt a human, and it is less wrong to hurt a rabbit than it is to hurt a dog, but it is still wrong. If you think it's ok for a more intelligent species to hurt a less intelligent species who is still capable of feeling pain, then you would be ok with killing humans as long as it's an alien species with vastly superior intelligence doing so. Also, maybe people with really high IQ should be able to torture and kill people with really low IQ for amusement?"

Please CMV: I have no problem whatsoever with animal cruelty,muddlet,0,"the thing is that animals experience emotions, they have personalities, they experience pain, they are able to learn, etc. i will give you that it's ok to kill insects because they don't actually have brains, just a basic nervous system. but mammals, birds etc are intelligent and aware. the other commenters have argued about empathy, but i'm looking at it like this: humans are also animals. sure, our brains are a bit more advanced, but we're not that far off chimpanzees or pigs or even rats. our brains are all very similar, and we share a lot of functions. it seems to me that you're drawing the line at an organisms ability for higher order thought - think philosophy, mathematics, complex languages - when you should be drawing the line at the ability to feel and be aware of pain. if an organism is capable of this, then hurting them is cruel. we make exceptions, using the greater good argument. for example, it is okay to use rats in research. but i know from experience that those rats are gently gassed to sleep and death when they are done with, not viciously killed or needlessly tortured. so even in the cases where hurting animals is deemed necessary, it is minimised. hurting an organism that thinks and feels when it isn't necessary to do so is a cruel thing to do."

Please CMV: I have no problem whatsoever with animal cruelty,ExploreMeDora,0,"Humans are animals too. We are the most complex and most intelligent animals. This does not make us special though. There are animals that are faster than us and animals that are stronger than us. There are animals that are more social than us and animals that are more affectionate than us. Just because other species are less intelligent does not mean that they are completely worthless. Yes, we do horrible things to other animals. However, they are usually based on enhancing our lives. Such as for entertainment at a zoo or for food. These things occur in the wild too. Lions hunt and kill antelope. We are able to systematically farm and process animals because of our intelligence. We do so to maximize our supply of food. This is different than needless and insensitive animal torture. Imagine a dog being being electrocuted by its owner because he/she feels pleasure from it. Imagine this dog being starved each day and feeling intense pain. It feels just as awful as a human would, but it can not express it. Picture the owner leaving the dog in a small dark room for hours and never letting it outside. Now imagine the owner bludgeoning the dog with a shovel every time it pees inside. It's cruel and pointless. To many people, torture is worse than death. Many animals have just as much of a grasp on time, days, pain, loneliness, and aggravation as humans do. However, they cannot say, """"Please stop,"""" or, """"Please put me out of my misery."""" As a human would. To help you understand why we feel so sorry for animals I will elaborate on the empathy stance. Yes, we empathize with living creatures that cannot understand or express pain like we do (children, animals). But we also feel more sorry when these animals exhibit behavior that relate more greatly to a human. For example, we will generally feel more sorry for a gorilla being tortured than a goldfish. You can see the pain in its eyes and face. If the animal screams as it is tortured we will feel even more sorry for it. If the animals mother cries and attempts to rescue it as it is tortured we will feel even more sorry for it. You see where I am going with this. This is why we usually don't care much about a fly being swatted and we certainly don't feel that bad if we rip a leaf off of a tree. I find it odd that you don't feel sorry for animals but you feel sorry for people. If you said you didn't feel sorry while either is tortured then I'd tell you that you have a textbook psychopathic personality. However, that's not the case. I hope you understand a bit more!"

Please CMV: I have no problem whatsoever with animal cruelty,jimjams_panjandrum,0,"So I have the perhaps niche view that all living things have inherent value and are of equal worth. All animals alive today, whether human or monkey, spent four billion years evolving to get here, and we only get one life and one functioning body each. Any attempt to set up a sort of competition after that, and rank the species of the world in terms of superiority is arbitrary and subjective. So, I see humanity as really interesting amazing creatures - but I also see platypuses, salamanders, oryx, numbats, tuna, etc as really interesting amazing creatures also. It seems pain and fear are pretty universal emotions. All animals seek to avoid negative stimulus. I have experienced pain myself, so I know it is unpleasant, and I exhibit the same behaviours as a lot of animals - drawing away quickly, yelling, touching the wound, seeking to avoid the same situation in the future - when I am hurt. As I have observed others exhibiting these behaviours in response to a stimulus I would find painful, I assume that pain is unpleasant for them as well. Most things, being alive and well, seem to want to stay that way. Given that I think animals have inherent value, are worth as much as people, only get one body and life, and would prefer not to suffer or die, I couldn't conscionably harm one, as much as I could hurt a fellow human, and I'll help one when I can. Being as I am related to other people, and animals, I assume that they experience some of the same emotions that I do. Rats will put themselves in danger or will refuse food to rescue another from a trap. Dogs are extremely aware of fairness, and will be upset when they, another dog, or their owner is given less reward for the same task. Mothers and their offspring have strong emotional bonds. And I assume that animals experience some emotions that I don't. I do not know the joy of the thrash metal fan, I do not know the sadness of the mother who has miscarried, I do not know the monogamous love of the albatross, I do not know the boiling hatred of neighbourhood cats. It is likely an animal species has its own emotions and experiences, which I will never understand, much as I have emotions and experiences they never can. Who knows what kind of minds they have, what it's like to be a bat, or a sloth, or whatever. Maybe it's wonderful, more wonderful than what it's like to be a human. I really see animals as equal but all different. This was probably not very persuasive, but I thought I would give my perspective."

Imagine trying to explain to a someone who has the same attitude to people as you do to animals why he should care about people. They can understand all the logic behind it, and live without hurting people, but if they just don't fundamentally feel anything wrong with it, they'll never really be able to actually care, its an emotion they just don't have. Other factors, like your caveats, mean living as if they care is justifiable. I'm sure you already know the reasons why you """"should"""" care about animals, but most people don't need to understand them to be able to care, they just do naturally. Its not something you should need to be convinced of, the reasons are more what we have come up with in an attempt to explain our emotional reaction, than the basis of it. As I said I'm no psychologist so this is just my speculation, but if I am along the right lines, then really what the discussion should be about is why you should act as though you care, which is hard to justify without falling back on premises that require you to care.

I will agree that nobody should force veganism (or vegetarianism) upon someone who is unwilling to make that lifestyle change, no arguments there. But in a group dining setting, I do not believe that it's unreasonable to expect some portion or version of the meal to be made vegan. I would think that their questioning of the cooks about what ingredients are going into their meals is more so that they can confirm for themselves that the meal will in fact be vegan. Sure, they know that butter is not vegan, but if they say nothing can they be sure that the cooking staff will remember not to put butter in the food prepared for them? Probably not, because non-vegans do not consider it to be as serious of a situation as they do, and a lot of people do not understand the actual meaning of vegan or vegetarian. I can't say for sure why they make comments like that to the meat-eaters of the group, but I will say that I very frequently am harassed by meat-eaters who try to convince me to eat meat. """"It's the way humans were meant to live"""", """"Do you remember what bacon tastes like? Don't you miss it?"""", """"Just one bite, I won't tell"""", """"Humans eat animals because we're smarter than them, there's nothing wrong with it"""", """"You're only vegetarian because it's trendy... when are you going to get over this phase?"""" Basically, in the time I have been a vegetarian, I have honestly experienced a great lack of respect for my dietary choice. I have said this before on Reddit and gotten downvotes because people claim it's only the other way around, but that has not been my experience at all. It is interesting to me, that some people get so defensive about respect for their choice to eat meat, yet they do not truly respect the choices of others not to eat it. I don't personally push my vegetarianism in people's faces, and I don't judge others for eating meat, but I can see how people may adopt this attitude if they have previously experienced the type of treatment that I have. If you had personally made a specific choice because you felt it was the ethical and moral thing to do, and then people mocked you or tried to convince you to give up your cause, do you think you would fight harder to turn people to your side? As for the """"quality of the baked goods suffering"""", I suppose that comes down to how """"fair"""" you think things should be. I'm assuming the baked goods are being made either all vegan or all non-vegan because it would be too much of a hassle to make both. If they were all non-vegan, the 5 or 6 vegans would not be able to have any of them. If they are all made vegan, everyone can have the baked treats, although they may suffer a bit in flavor from lack of animal products. In my mind, it is more fair to make the baked treats accessible to anyone who wants one, but I can see how a person might feel that people who make an ethical choice not to eat animal products are just opting themselves out of delicious baked goods and should deal with it."

When this has happened to me I've simply refused to engage them on their terms. I have a fairly high tolerance for discourtesy, and don't feel the need to justify my choices to anyone else. If it were me I would simply cook the bacon and ignore them. I would likely avoid being in this type of a situation with them again, and this behavior would likely affect my opinion of that person.

"CMV: If one is vegan and dining in a group, one should not force veganism upon the group.",not_homestuck,0,"I'm not vegetarian and I agree with what you're saying here for the most part, but I'll try and approach this from a vegan perspective. Let's say it wasn't vegetarianism, but cannibalism that was popular and trendy for people to participate in. Every day you went to lunch and all your coworkers ate human remains of people who had been killed for their meat. Wouldn't you say something? Wouldn't you plead with those people to stop eating meat? If somebody replied """"It's just my lifestyle,"""" you'd probably say something like """"But it's killing living things. I can't sit by and say nothing when it's such an important issue."""" Obviously, most people don't equate killing and eating animals with killing and eating a human being (in my opinion rightfully so). But I think the argument still stands. You disagree with cannibalism because you're killing a sentient creature; vegetarians and vegans disagree with eating meat because you're killing a living thing. The standards aren't as specific but it's probably just as important to them. It's just about how strongly you believe whether something is right or wrong, and whether you feel comfortable sitting back and letting other people do something you consider """"wrong"""". I don't personally agree with it for a variety of reasons but I can understand why a vegan who views eating meat as murder would be upset and attempt to persuade their friends and family to change their behavior."

"CMV: If one is vegan and dining in a group, one should not force veganism upon the group.",swearrengen,0,"&gt;However, when one is in the minority as a vegan, it is not okay to constantly nit-pick about the dietary choices of those who are not. I detest vegan piousness as much as the next bacon eater, but shouldn't you allow them this social freedom so that us bacon eaters can retain our own freedom to extol the virtues of meat and/or defend ourselves and fight back? A social taboo against criticizing other people's food choices works against against the majority too. And if meat eaters were the minority at a table, you'd still want them to have a say regarding the menu. But how is it that a minority vegan view has this amazing power to virtue signal and guilt the whole table to order vegan? There must be a social taboo already in place - against a meat eater's defense! Veganism can do this because it's not *really* about food or diet, it's a *moral ideology* that fills western society's ethical vacuum and claims the moral high ground in the absence of any ideological fightback. We shouldn't have let this happen, but we did because we were philosophically unprepared and just wanted to eat in peace at the dinner table goddammit. Perhaps for fear of human heroes, we have anthropomorphized the animal kingdom for our children in our cartoons and movies - and by the time they are teens searching for meaning, right and wrong, empathizing emotionally with existential horror at documentaries that show the abuse of farm animals they will be ripe receptacles to watch a lecture by Gary Yourofsky or learn a Peter Singer argument - and become vegan soldiers. A war is coming. With the Peppa Pig generation. And if we can't defend ourselves, we are going to lose."
"CMV: If one is vegan and dining in a group, one should not force veganism upon the group.",rabifant,0,"I would want to highlight two inconsistencies between your stated view and your circumstance. It doesn't seem like the vegans are """"forcing"""" veganism upon the group, but rather being insufferably rude when vegan meals are not provided. Secondly, the word """"legitimate"""" is used to defend the dietary options of others, but invites analysis of the vegan moral argument which you previously state is outside the scope of the discussion. Some arguments (which you can evaluate) would be: 1. The moral permissibly (an interpretation of """"legitimacy"""" if we don't just care about laws which are actually kind of funny in some states) of a diet is dependent upon the process by which the food is obtained/prepared. Example: A diet comprised of still-beating human heart is not legitimate because it necessitates the killing of a human being which is morally reprehensible. 2. It is morally reprehensible to constrain the diet of another person if their diet is morally permissible. Example: If someone eats apples and oranges from their orchard, and you force them not eat oranges anymore, this is morally reprehensible. So, I think you see that the answer to your question hinges on the """"legitimacy"""" (i.e. moral permissibly) of non-vegan diets. I think it would be quite difficult to convince you one way or another without evaluating that topic further. I think the best I could do is say that: If the vegans are contributing money/work towards a meal that they expect to be able to eat, only to find that it doesn't conform to their dietary standards, that is morally reprehensible. Outside of betraying an expectation that their diet be accommodated, I don't think you can get much further without evaluating the implications of either diet."

I think being vegan/vegetarian for a cause doesn't make sense. CMV,sunshinestateofbeing,0,"First in referencing the food chain carnivore is not synonymous with human. They have neither tooth nor claw, speed nor strength that qualifies a comparison. Their sole qualification to apex predator is their ability to use tools. Unlike other predators, humans have no physical adaptation for killing. So in that a human's place as predator or prey, in the food chain, is subject to fluctuation dependent on circumstances. Being massed comfy inside a well lit city has let humans forget their actual place in the food chain. A fully grown adult human, alone... is more vulnerable than a gazelle. If this were a case of stronger vs weaker, we certainly wouldn't win. Even a human fully armed, a bear (apex predator, omnivore) encounter could result in death. So what is natural for lions, tigers and wolves...carnivores. With no other dietary source of food. Does not equate to what is natural for humans, omnivores. Opportunistic eaters, with multiple dietary sources of food. As far as what is worse being eaten by a lion or butchered by a human. While it is no picnic to be bitten by the throat and killed by predators. The lion, although in her own self interest, aims for as swift a kill as possible. Getting severely injured by fighting prey means that is the lion's last meal. The prey however has the chance to escape. So most of the lion's catch is slow, young, sick or injured animals. Overall strengthening the herbivore gene pool. As is the natural order of things. While the slaughter of our meals, involves... Boiling alive, grinding alive, draining conscious animals of blood, throats ripped out while conscious, electrocuted, mutilated, suffocated, dragged if immobile, bludgeoned to death and skinned alive. These are facts. It is your choice to care or not. The butcher's knife just slices your meat into cuts. The slaughterhouse assembly line handles the slaughter in the cheapest and fastest way possible. Do not be fooled into thinking that animals in our hands are served a better life than the one they would have had naturally. Most animals you consume are sick. Due to their living conditions. They are automatically given antibiotics to stave off the more severe diseases and spoiling the product. Most animals are confined to spaces smaller than their own girth forced to live in their feces. Neither us nor the animals consumed participate in natural behaviors. There is no natural selection for us or them. Neither us nor the animals eat their natural diet. Humans are hunter-gatherers. The diet of our closest relative in evolution is herbivore. The diet of a fellow omnivore, bears, is mostly plants. Despite the fact that he, unlike us, is physically adapted to killing. Veganism is a movement to abstain from these acts. A recognition of the imbalance of these acts in the natural order of things. And the realization that humans ability to use tools has exceeded what is natural in regards to food and has moved to harmful. There are more livestock in the US than people. More grain gets fed to livestock than sold to people. Clearing land for animals and the grain to feed them, amounts to massive destruction of the environment. World hunger would end, if we fed animal grain to everyone. Chemical filler is so commonplace that our country’s meat supply contains the residues of 500 to 600 different chemicals. So in summation, veganism is about more than just asking you to empathize with captive tortured animals. * The food you eat is medically bad for you * The animals you eat from are sick, disgustingly filthy and filled with chemicals. Before and after death. * The massive production of meat is destroying the world more than your hummer * The humans massive consumption of meat is not physiologically cohesive to their natural diet. * Humans are going against natural selection. Lastly it is humans superior intellect that has allowed them to develop tools to manipulate the food chain and equally to have empathy for each other and other things. Regardless of people's perceived superiority to herbivores, it doesn't give us the right to do something just because we can. Guns aren't natural and were invented 800 years ago. Without which would you feel confident in your natural ability to fight a bear, a cougar or catch an animal? A lot of herbivores have natural defenses, like cows. Who predominately have horns both male and female. Burned off in captivity. If locked in a pen with a bull, what's the list of tools you need to feel """"adapted"""" to kill. So...if sentenced to death and given the choice to be killed by a lion or in a slaughterhouse, with your superior intellect which would you choose?"

I can, however, see why many vegans would choose their lifestyle. Obviously, it means different things to different people and there's variation, but it seems to me that the majority of vegans believe that by less people eating meat, there will be less harm to environment. This does seem, at least to me, to be a good reason to be a vegan. There are, of course, other ways, such as buying local and others, which are also perfectly viable.

Obviously, this argument only holds if you accept that non-human animals have the capacity to suffer and have an aversion to suffering, and if you have a desire to lessen unnecessary suffering even if it takes a little effort.

Second, I would point out that their [conclusions are not consensus](http://cmr.asm.org/content/24/4/718.full). Second, I would point out that the largest antibiotic usage among American farm animals is in beef, where it's used for two things primarily: To keep down gut infections because we feed them an inappropriate diet that makes them sick (grain), and to increase weight gain. But your main thesis appears to be that if people don't personally start raising livestock they don't care about those animals seems unreasonable on the face of it. Many people live in places where what you're suggesting is simply impossible or illegal. And extending the reasoning logically to any/all causes seems to fail catastrophically. """"If you really cared about ethical sourcing of materials, you'd dig your own coltan mines"""", or """"if you really cared about aerial killing of wolves, you'd go to Montana with anti-aircraft rockets"""", or """"if you don't start your own business and hire women you don't care about gender equality""""... Requiring personal direct participation in every important goal of modern society is unreasonable, it seems to me.

"CMV:If consumers were truly concerned about farm animal welfare, more of them would be involved in small scale agriculture",andrewnap12,0,"I agree with argument stating humane treatment of animals is impossible due to the degree of demand. To offer a macroeconomic perspective as to why individuals should not raise their own livestock, I argue the following: all economies of the world are advanced via specialization and technology. Specialization allows for someone to become an expert in the field in question (in this case, a farmer). A constituency of specialized farmers who produce only farm-related goods will produce more of these goods than the entire population producing their """"fair share"""" of such goods. This is true due to the high amount of goods/services necessary/desired for consumption in our society and the constraints of time and resources. If your logic is that since these farming specialists are acting unethically (which I agree, they are), then we should each allocate our time and resources to performing their specialty in a more humane way, I would argue that the outcome is less efficiency and less overall production. In fact, if farmers were phased out completely, we would a) not come close to the output they currently produce b) sacrifice time and resources that could be allocated elsewhere in the economy, thus decreasing overall economic output. To apply that logic to all unethical fields, imagine if we each had to find the time/resources to ethically produce/complete our fair of each unethical industry's good/service. There is not enough time in the day/money in my pocket for me to gather my own reliable news, cage-free eggs, non-fracked oil, non-blood diamonds, etc. Specialization allows for maximum production in one industry while allowing beneficiaries to work in their respective industries as well. Trying to produce enough of one good or service to sustain yourself is less efficent and more costly (both nominally and opportunistically) than allowing a specialist to do their job. But animal treatment is rather disgusting, regardless. Interesting thread, open to other perspectives."
"CMV:If consumers were truly concerned about farm animal welfare, more of them would be involved in small scale agriculture",Fizzy_T,0,"&gt;If consumers really want these practices to be phased out while positively impacting animal health and welfare and without lowering their current demands, more people need to be willing to raise food on a small scale, not just pay the premiums at the farmers market. Why can't someone just pay a premium for someone else to grow it for them? If you support a local farm you help them grow as a business and be more efficient in creating sustainable produce for others. &gt;The fact that people aren't willing to properly educate themselves on these animal welfare issues or become involved the production of their own animal products lead me to believe that most don't actually care about the living conditions of farm animals.

"CMV:If consumers were truly concerned about farm animal welfare, more of them would be involved in small scale agriculture",pheen0,0,"It seems like there are two points you're making. The first is that people don't care in any meaningful way about animal welfare. The second is that if they DID, they would support small scale farming. It's hard to argue the first point. Many people (myself included) are weak-willed and eat meat because they enjoy it, despite the enormous ethical and ecological costs. We accomplish this by just... not thinking about the cruelty and environmental toll. It's a genuinely lousy thing about humans. But the second point goes off the rails. How do you arrive at the conclusion that small scale agriculture is the metric by which we should measure how much humans care? Even grass-fed beef are killed in the prime of their life, for no reason more compelling than a trivial desire for a tasty meal we don't need. They're more sustainable than feed-lot beef by most metrics (though they also take longer to grow to slaughtering size, which offsets some of those benefits), but they're still less sustainable than a vegetarian diet. Grass fed beef also require ~3x as much land as grain fed, so a switch to small scale farming without a reduction in demand would lead to a massive increase in agricultural land. I guess my question is, why small scale agriculture? Reduction in meat intake is what you should be looking for."

I don't think this is unique to animal rights, though. You could say that about damn near any movement. If you have a charity for clean drinking water, it's probably also full of thin, pretty, white women (to use your description). As for the vegan restaurant markup, that's just an artifact of the culture right now. There's no reason it has to be that expensive to eat vegetarian, and in fact, in towns with a greater percentage of vegetarians, you'll find actual competition among those restaurants. My own town has several fast-casual veggie restaurants that are no more expensive than Burger King. Lastly, it need not """"take the backseat"""" to anything. There are billions of us. We have enough resources to go around. We don't need to prioritize our concerns."
CMV:I believe animal rights is a bourgeoisie social issue and undermines the struggle of the poor.,teskedtesked,1,"Plenty of animal rights activists out there are not out to shame you for everything you do; a big part of animal rights is not about preventing all animals from ever being killed, but rather is about making sure that the animals you *do* kill don't spend their short time on earth in pain, abused or ill (things which can and often do affect the actual quality and *safety* of the meat you're getting from them). It may be that the animal rights activists that shout the loudest (i.e. PETA) are the least willing to allow you to eat what you grew up with, and the least willing to admit that there might be bigger problems, but that's not really representative of the issue as a whole. And that being said, people who care compassionately about animal rights tend to also care compassionately about other issues, groups of people, etc. They're not mutually exclusive... that is to say, just because I don't want the cows sold to McDonald's to spend their lives stressed out and knee-deep in shit doesn't mean I want people to spend their lives that way instead. Also, animal rights issues often extend beyond the simple idea of not wanting an animal to suffer... for example, people who fight for the improvement of factory farming or the fishing industry could very well be doing so out of concern for the environment, or the water supply, or evolving antibiotic resistance... issues that theoretically concern all of us, including the poor. Some people have the time and resources to fight for these things and others don't."

Food and water that could be consumed by humans is instead given to animals, which are then eaten by the rich. This directly contributes to global food insecurity as countries like Brazil devote more of their grain crop to the lucrative animal Agri-sector. Yes vegan restaurants are expense but that is just because they cater to a more upscale ground. Actually going vegan or vegetarian is a lot cheaper in terms of groceries as you begin to get your protein from beans (which are like 99c a can) instead of meat (which is at its cheapest is like 4-5$/serving). The only way veganism is more expansive at the grocery store is a) if you weren't eating a full diet already or b) you live in a food desert. You compare to McDonald's but in my area a Big Mac combo (one meal) is 10$; for that amount, I could buy enough veggies and tofu for ~ 4 meals. Yes vegan restaurants are more upscale but generally vegans only eat food they are prepping themselves as so few vegan fast food options exist; ergo it is cheaper. It being a middle class concern and centred around white women is fair, but doesn't really add much. Racism and sexism are very popular among the poor, does that mean diversity or multiculturalism should be written off as a bourgeois scheme? I can't comment on the cultural food thing but have you considered trying to make cultural dishes vegan? My girlfriend is Filipino and vegan and she loves to make veganized filipino food (Such as tofu adobo or imitation meat poncet) in this way she both gets to enjoy her cultural food and stay vegan. Similarly, I am vegetarian and when my family does holiday meals they're usually meat centric; last time though I prepared vegan gravy and fake turkey for myself so I could partake without breaking my ethical commitment"

If cows where instinctive creatures they would not require such a large brain. Cows do have some instinctive behaviours as indeed do we. Nonetheless cows like us are sentient and aware, they can think, feel and are capable of emotions and numerous others attributes that may well surprise most people who see them only as milk and meat producing automatons &gt;Cows understand cause and effect, this is indicative of advanced cognitive abilities which demonstrates that they are aware. Research studies show us that cows understand cause and effect, for instance cows have learnt that when they are thirsty that pushing a lever to operate a drinking fountain provides them with water and when they are hungry cows have learnt that pressing a button with their heads provides them with food. Cows, a common food animal, are highly intelligent and sentient. Vegetarians often have no issue eating meat, they simply have an issue eating meat from sentient beings. If meat grew on trees or plant food came from sentient plants their eating habits would often be reversed. http://timeforchange.org/are-cows-cause-of-global-warming-meat-methane-CO2 18% of green house gases, causing global warming, are produced by animals, generally from cows farting methane.

There are all sorts of reasons to be a vegetarian other than moral issues of eating an animal. For instance, I am vegetarian because I disagree with the scale which we produce cows. We chop down rainforrests and then cows pump all sorts of gas into the atmosphere. The rates at which we fish is also a problem because the fish which we eand messes with species which we don't even eat since they get caught in nets, fi. See dolphins and such. In my opinion, as long as we treat the animals we rear with respect then everything is fine. By this I mean giving them a good and healthy life as well as a clean death. &gt;It's also quite common to vegetarians to have health problem because of their eating habit. This may be true, but you have to consider that it's because they aren't doing it correctly. If you do your research you'll find that as long as you eat some spinach then you won't become anemic and if you eat tofu/beans/nuts then you'll have plenty of protein. Ultimately, this is not the strongest part of your argument because it doesnt mean that being a vegetarian isn't beneficial for your health it just means that it's not trivial. I find that I eat much more vegetables now which means I have a healthier diet. It's not difficult either, you just need to learn a couple of new recepies. &gt;Simply human body isn't designed to not to eat meat. 1. Our bodies aren't meant to do a lot of things which we do on a daily basis. That doesnt mean anything in and of itself. 2. The human body CAN function just fine without meat. In ancient times, meat was a rare treat. Not something you would eat every day like we do in the present. Meat was important but still scarce. Note that a healthy diet consists of lots of fruits/nuts/vegetables and much less meat than people eat on a day to day basis. &gt;All in All I don't see benefit of being vegan other than Vegans consume less resources of our planet This is the thing with being vegan and to a lesser extent vegetarian. If everyone did this then the strain which humans have on the environment would be severely reduced. 1. We wouldn't harm as many species through cutting down forrests and fishing 2. We would severely reduce our greenhouse emissions 3. We lead healthier lives as a result"

CMV: Vegetarianism isn't Beneficial to humanity in General and Sort of Racist in a Sense that Plants are inferior to Humans and Animal.,Radijs,0,"&gt;Imho is Vegetarians aren't eating Animals mainly because Humans are Evolve from Animals. Thus We shouldn't eat them. This isn't really the case. There's several reasons why people choose to become vegetarians. The reasons I've heard primarily are: 1. I don't like meat. Plain and simple, some people don't like the taste of meat. And so they prefer not to eat it. 2. The way animals are kept for the slaughter is cruel and the amount they suffer is disproportional to our need for meat. If you look at the bio-industry you can see where animals are treated quite horribly, having tails and ears cut off, being kept in tiny pens where they can't even turn around etc. Some people think that as humans we need to rise above inflicting such cruelty on animals that have minds and who can feel pain. 3. It's consuming too much recourses and leads to a great deal of pollution and wastefulness. This argument you briefly adressed yourself. It costs a ton of food to raise an animal to slaughter, and it's not ethical to waste so much food while there are parts of the world where people regularly starve. So far I've never heard the argument that because animals could evolve sentience it's morally wrong to eat them. Now the same arguments raised at points 1 and 2 don't really apply to plants because they are much more limited in what they can experience. A plant can't feel happy or sad, it can't register pain in any way. So it's not objectionable to eat them."

They emphasize with the pain that these animals experience simply because the animals display similar signs that people do when they are distressed and plants don't. Even if something could become sentient in the future doesn't change the fact that it isn't right now.

Furthermore, evolution takes millions of years, and I'm not sure if plants, which are *really* far removed from the kingdom Animalia, could even become sentient, but I don't see why you're choosing to explore that hypothetical scenario. And yes, vegetarians who don't get sufficient protein (which makes up ALL living things) or other nutrients, just like any other person, will suffer. However, plenty of vegetarians and vegans thrive on their diet, so it is possible to not eat meat. The principle of veganism is to reduce harm to animals. Most farms use rather cruel methods, so you can see why one might want to do this. Being vegan also has some alleged health benefits, although it's possible to eat only junk on a vegan diet.

There exist no other phenomena in the universe to our understanding that simulates our own existence, I am including all animals in this existence because in the broad view of the universe we are very much like other animals, we live and we die, we just happen to have more developed brains.

Convention vegetables are often grown with synthetic fertilizers (but can also have animal inputs like manure or bonemeal). Assuming synthetic fertilizers, this leads to large amounts of runoff which is harmful to both local and foreign ecosystems. See [the gulf dead zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_zone_%28ecology%29). This threat to wildlife and eventually human life is also not ideal for vegans.

Let's go the extra step and say they bred us to be dumb and docile at the same time, for tens of thousands of years, and we're artificially selected to become an unremarkable animal bred to be edible and easily harvested, to the point that *that's* the only real purpose for our existence anymore. Let's go an extra step further, and say this colonization event happened about 20,000 years ago, which places us right on the door step of the Stone Age, and *then* fast forward to 2017, or whatever dating system they use in the current year. What am I going to care if that's life?

As long as those needs were all met for the most part, we wouldn't really bat an eye to the idea that we were just being harvested for food or fuel or something else. And it's not like the aliens would harm us prior to harvest day, since bruises and broken bones or starvation and neglect result in product that can't be sold. We probably wouldn't even have the intelligence to piece together the sentence """"yo, Steve, something feels weird... do you get the feeling that we're in a slaughterhouse?"""" And as long as I die quickly, when am I going to have the time or where with all to care? What am I going to care what my body parts were used for? &gt;Anything in between is needless virtue signalling.

One takes place in the final minutes of life. The other lasts months or years. For your alien example, let's say they're eating people like you say. You can pick a) you get to live your life in a normal way, but eventually you get slaughtered. You get space to move, friends, and normal daily activities. Your life is cut short, but you are not unhappy or sick during your time alive. You are unaware for the most part of how you will die, so you do not dwell on it. Or you can choose b) from the time you are born, you are held in a tiny cage where you cannot turn around. You get bed sores and you are sick. You aren't allowed to play or learn language or be around your mom. You watch the murder of those around you and wait for your own. They are just keeping you alive with the bare minimum needed for you to stay alive. Which do you choose? Of course you don't want to be eaten in either scenario.

Our very physiology is designed to rely on animal slaughter. Meat production is just a way of simplifying that. Humans have the cognitive ability to recognize the rights of other humans and sapient creatures. Animals don't. Animals won't hesitate to kill, harm, or inconvenience humans in following their natural impulses. The line has to be drawn somewhere, and why not draw it between slaughter for practical purposes and needless abuse? That's an important (enough) distinction. Otherwise, why stop at outlawing livestock slaughter? There's a plethora of other ways humans harm animals, direct and indirect; e.g. land development, pest control, pollution, etc. Human society would be effectively paralyzed.

However, lets assume for a second that you are actually not against animals and would like to lessen their unnecessary suffering as far as possible (I even can accept that you still eat meat, because you can't quit eating it). So, let's assume you understand the issue about animal rights, in general. Then from the moral point of view it is not important that the law, indeed, is hypocritical. Because you want to minimize suffering and this is a law which does that. In general, you can not expect from a society to have laws which are free of hypocorticism. For example lets say there are laws which guarantee the freedom of speech. Assume, the freedom of speech at the moment is restricted, then the society is hypocritical. However, you probably will agree that it is better to go on having this law, instead of saying """"You know what? The society doesn't obey this law completely, then lets abandon it!"""". That is, for the benefit of the society it is still better to have this law. Similarly for the benefit of animals rights it is still better to have this law than none.

However, I fail to see the leap in logic that says animals shouldn't have any rights whatsoever and we should torture and torment them as much as we want just because some animals in that country are killed to eat. For example, let's take a cow that's going to be slaughtered for beef when it's grown. Should the fact that it's going to be slaughtered for consumption mean we can beat, torment, or torture that cow in any way we want, and when the time comes just slaughter it in any old way with no consideration for any fear, trauma, or pain it might endure in the process? I eat meat but I really don't think the animals should be mistreated or tortured beforehand *just* because we'll end up eating them. Now let's take a second scenario. We slaughter cows for food. Should we then allow people to starve their dogs, not get them vet care, keep them in tiny cages with piles of their own feces until the pads of their feet literally burn off, let them become matted and covered in open sores, or even worse, allow people to do things like drag them behind a moving car, set them on fire, cut off their ears, etc. with no consideration for the fear, pain, and trauma the animal goes through? Your only consideration seems to be that we can't do that to *other people's animals* because they're property, so do you mean that people should be allowed to do that *to their own animals* because we kill different animals for meat?"
CMV: Animal rights shouldn't exist in countries which allow consumption of meat. The only animals that should be legally protected are the ones needed to maintain an ecological balance.,[deleted],0,"&gt;I think that every society has a question to answer- do they value animals as sentient beings worthy of rights? When it allows meat consumption, that question has already been answered. It should be answered once and for all, not on a case by case basis. Hmm, I would say it is when a society allows pets that this question has been answered. Pets have no rights. They are completely controlled by their masters. If their master wishes them to be treated for an illness, they are. Otherwise, they die. They have no right to medical treatment. Pets do not have the right to free movement. If they leave their home, they are often forcibly returned to their masters. Pets do not have any rights at all. They are purchased and sold. So while you can make it about slaughter, the truth of the matter is when animals are made pets, the society has decided that they do not deserve rights of free movement, rights to healthcare, rights to a pursuit of happiness, etc. And yet, would you, knowing this, be in favor of limiting cruelty towards pets? The pets don't have rights in many cases, but perhaps at least they deserve the right to not be beaten and killed by their masters?"

The world: 1. All other things being equal, a world with less suffering is better than a world with more suffering; 2. Unnecessary suffering is wrong, and should not be supported or encouraged; The person: 1. We ought to avoid performing actions that make the world a worse place (the morally neutral position); - You are at least a morally neutral person; The animals: 1. Non-human animals are capable of suffering; - It is morally wrong to cause an animal unnecessary suffering; Meat: 1. Virtually all ways of raising and slaughtering animals cause suffering; - In modern societies, meat is not necessary for human survival or good health; Thus, the action of eating meat causes unnecessary suffering, and therefore should be avoided by a morally neutral or good person. Note that this argument also applies to other animal products. I've cut out a lot of the argument that I didn't consider necessary to the core points so my argument is not a complete reconstruction of the argument in the paper.

CMV: Animal rights advocates who gain employment on farms solely in hopes of recording animal abuse are not doing a good deed.,exotics,0,"Have you head of Temple Grandin? She was very concerned with animal welfare, particularly of beef cattle. She acknowledged fully that we would be raising them for the purpose of slaughter but after working on farms and visiting auction yards she noted areas where things were being done wrong and how they could be improved. Thanks to her many slaughter facilities and auction markets adopted her systems (which were not cheap to implement I might add) and the result was fewer losses in the line and less stress on the cattle over all - it was a wonderful result. As such there is some value to the right minded person working in certain fields because they can make things better over all.\ Had animal rights activists not raised the alarm in regards to some animal abuse instances on some farms and and at some slaughter yards, I am sure others wouldn't be so aware of the need to be better in the area of animal husbandry."
CMV: Animal rights advocates who gain employment on farms solely in hopes of recording animal abuse are not doing a good deed.,broccolicat,0,"&gt; These events may not have resulted in legal ramifications, but an individual cow or pig doesn't care of the person punching her gets a felony charge. She doesn't think it's worth it to get a few more hours of footage so maybe someone will get jail time. She just wants the abuse to stop, but it will be allowed to continue until someone actually says something. I want to start with that I 100% agree with your that last statement; at the end of the day, the animals themselves just don't want to be there suffering at all. So, I'm vegan and involved a bit in AR and know people who do this sort of work. It might comfort you to know every one I met already worked in these fields before they got involved in animal rights, and can recognize the difference between a sincere worker having a bad day and a routine abuser- because they once thought like you. Also, many of us AR types (but sadly not all) recognize that animal arg also has exceptionally high rates of worker abuse. Environments with higher worker abuse are going to result in more animal abuse, and it all goes full circle. It actually breaks my heart when slaughterhouse workers ask angrily if I want them to be without a job; no, I totally want them to have a much better one, one as high paying, that hires new immigrants and low skilled workers, without the same risks of injuries and worker mistreatment. I don't know where you live, but where I live they are pushing for arg gag laws. They are trying to prevent any eyes at all on the industry, and that is a problem. The less accountability, the more problems arise in both worker and animal protection. The best practical approach to both stopping undercover activists and the abuse is to move towards a """"glass wall"""" approach to the entire industry, like 24/7 internet live feeds or open tours of all parts of the process. edit: lol, i meant 24/7, not 23/7.

Maybe not big changes, but changes nonetheless. Not necessarily in the USA, but in other parts of the world where things are perhaps worse. Dog slaughter is getting huge attention now and people are up in arms against it and it is forcing change. Places are starting to outlaw the eating of dog meat as a result. I wonder if an animal rights person went in to a pig farm here and filmed how pigs are kept in the horrid gestation crates if the public would respond in the same way they did to dogs? Well - to be fair.. some like bacon too much... but some people would at least reduce the amount of meat they ate as a result. I stopped eating chicken years ago after seeing how chickens were kept (and now I have pet chickens, including roosters). So sometimes change does come - but of course the people who make their money in the industry don't necessarily want people to stop eating meat, drinking milk, or eating eggs, so they don't want any negative publicity."

CMV: Animal rights advocates who gain employment on farms solely in hopes of recording animal abuse are not doing a good deed.,ardetor,0,"It seems you have been working in environments where animal abuse is not tolerated. That is the correct stance which businesses should take. However, in the case of a farm where there is *systematic* abuse, the approach you have taken would not work. An employer who relies on substandard animal welfare to cut costs will not agree to improve conditions just because an employee makes complaints. The employee will be let go, and the abuse will likely continue. I have worked in environments where complaints are routinely shrugged off by middle management, because it would be too much trouble to deal with. If a single complaint is made to higher authorities, there *may* be an investigation, and the systematic abuse *may* stop. But what is more likely is that the employer will hide the evidence of abuse temporarily, and resume once the authorities turn their backs. They have experience hiding it; after all, they have to pass the standard checks once a year or so. The complaint earns only a brief reprieve. Only by gathering evidence over a period of time and establishing the """"pattern of abuse"""", as you said, will it become possible to *reliably* shut down an abusive farm for good. If a half-baked attempt is done and fails, the employer will likely become much more suspicious of new hires, and severely harm future attempts to collect evidence. The abusive farm will become that much harder to shut down, and it may become impossible to save the animals. You say that: &gt; ...an individual cow or pig doesn't care of the person punching her gets a felony charge. She doesn't think it's worth it to get a few more hours of footage so maybe someone will get jail time. She just wants the abuse to stop, but it will be allowed to continue until someone actually says something. But, what will *actually* happen on a systematically abusive farm, is that the employee making the complaint will be fired on some pretext, and the abuse will continue the very next day. Is it worth it to buy a single day of peace for a cow, and condemn it to abuse for the rest of its life? In fact, you buy a day of peace for a *single* animal, and condemn the *thousands* of animals in the farm which now will not be shut down. I know it is a painful decision, but waiting and gathering evidence will do *far* more good in the long term."
CMV: Animal rights advocates who gain employment on farms solely in hopes of recording animal abuse are not doing a good deed.,AurelianoTampa,1,"In Harry Potter, the Potions teacher Severus Snape abused students for years. Insults, sabotage, bullying, even at times cursing students. Before that he was a known Death Eater, personally responsible for revealing information that led to murder of James and Lily Potter. Albus Dumbledore, widely considered one of the most powerful, wise, and kind wizards of the 20th century, not only refused to intercede directly to stop his in-class abuses, but protected Snape from any consequences for his entire history of criminal behavior. Behavior which would otherwise have ended up with him facing at least firing, if not incarceration. Why did Dumbledore refuse to do get Snape punished when he clearly knew about his on-going abuse of students and his history of criminal activity? Did Dumbledore not value his students on an individual basis? Did he see their suffering as a means to further his agenda? I'd argue the answer to both questions would be """"No."""" He valued his students and hated to see them hurt; he did not see their suffering as a means to advance his agenda, but rather a necessary side effect to obtain a greater good overall. And of course we find out that's the case - Snape plays a key role as an informant against Voldemort. Without him aiding Dumbledore and the Order, the actions of Voldemort and his followers would almost certainly have been more vicious, widespread, and unpredictable. Now, the obvious question is """"What the hell does that have to do with insider recordings of a pattern of animal abuses?"""" Hopefully you've deduced the parallels, but if not I will try to be even clearer. Dumbledore in this case is the insider informant. He clearly doesn't like the abuse of his students (animals), and he does have the power to report the crimes and get Snape (the individual abuser) charged. However, by doing so he loses the chance to dismantle a much larger group, the Death Eaters (the widespread pattern of abuse in the livestock industry), whose abuses will likely continue or escalate if Snape takes the fall early on. Just because someone allows smaller sacrifices for the greater good does not mean they don't care about those who are sacrificed. It's just that if you can save a handful of students (animals) now, it means many more will continue to face even worse treatment down the line. It's cold logic, but that doesn't mean the person who does this doesn't care or isn't doing good."

The act was intentional, entirely avoidable, and suggests an extreme lack of compassion and a predisposition for antisocial behavior. Here is the important part: in no way could a pet or farm animal be seen as mere property, for the owner to do with as they please, without also admitting that a similar ownership could be had by one human being over another. If it is permissible to beat *your* dog, why not *your* baby? What objective, measurable quality does an infant have, that a dog, or a cat, or a pig does not? An infant can not reason better, does not feel more, is no more fluent, no more aware of itself, has no better claim to be free from suffering than does any domesticated animal, at least as far as I can surmise. The only discernible difference between a nonhuman animal and an infant is the fact that an infant is a member of the species *Homo sapiens*. But does being a member of that particular species really grant a being special privileges? If so, why? If we are to have compassion for each other, and children, would it not be hypocritical to forego compassion for other creatures as well? We are just one of many species of animals, after all. Perhaps it would be wise to judge a being's moral worth by their capacity to feel, to suffer at our hands, instead of arbitrarily drawing a line between """"us"""" and """"them."""""

"CMV: Being vegan is pointless, why make your life less enjoyable?",sydbobyd,0,"Well I posted on your other thread that was removed, I'm just going to copy/paste again here. As a vegan, my tenets are basically this: 1. Unnecessary harm is unethical 2. Eating meat harms animals 3. The large majority of our meat consumption is unnecessary 4. Therefore, most of our meat consumption is unethical. To get deeper into some of your questions, I'll start by defining """"veganism"""": &gt; Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose. By that definition, it's not seen as unethical in every situation for every person to never eat meat. When it's necessary for whatever reason, it's not unethical. But the evidence shows that people can live healthily on vegan diets, so when it's possible, that's the most ethical course of action. &gt; even though most mammals have to eat other animals to survive There are two main differences between humans consuming meat and other animals. 1. Humans have an ethical code that other animals don't have. Is it okay for humans to kill humans if chimps kill chimps? Lot's of horrible things happen in nature, mothers killing babies, ducks raping. I don't look to nature to inform my ethics. 2. Many other animals need to eat meat to survive. A lion has to kill other animals. Humans do not. We can live healthy lives without it, so we have a choice. Why choose the path that causes more harm? &gt; Why would anyone give up eating meat? Millions of years of evolution made it delicious. Taste is not a justification for causing harm. Would it be okay to kill and eat humans if they were delicious? &gt; There seems like there is no reward to not any meat (my main point). The reward is comparable to anything you do on ethical grounds. I choose not to torture the guy sitting next to me because it's unethical, what exactly is my reward for that? &gt; Also, if we can survive not eating meat, how come in a survival situation people might resort to cannibalism and not eat grass? Meat is a more efficient calorie source. In a survival situation, getting enough calories to survive is crucial. And in a survival situation, I don't think it's unethical to eat meat. But that's not the situation most of us are in now. &gt; It almost seems like they are not helping the animals really. I don't know what you mean by that. The whole point is to help animals and reduce suffering. How does reducing our consumption not reduce harm?"

"CMV: Being vegan is pointless, why make your life less enjoyable?",weeping_demon7,0,"I'm not a vegan or a vegetarian myself, but I know many, many people who are one or the other. Most people seem to be discussing this from the standpoint of individuals not wanting to harm another living being nor consume any animal product. That is surely the case for many vegans. However, another perspective, one which doesn't appear to be getting too much coverage on this discussion, is the idea of being a vegan for political and socio-economic reasons. The reasoning goes that raising and harvesting animals consumes a disproportionate amount of global resources. I'm not a biologist or ecologist, but when one cow is raised and then slaughtered, the nutritional value we derive from all the grain and nutrients the cow itself consumed is something like less than 5%. Which means that 95% of the nutritional energy and resources that went in to raising the cow is wasted. If instead all that water, food, grazing space, etc. went to sustainably growing more efficient plant-based food, we would be wasting less global resources while also getting more nutritional product. It's great to be in a part of the world where we can 'waste' so much energy and so many resources on harvesting and slaughtering tasty animals. But this of course means there is less vegan food we could be producing and exporting more cheaply for the developing world. And that's more or less the argument from this perspective. Another perspective re: why some people feel being a vegetarian isn't enough goes something like this. Say I want to be a vegetarian, so I get to consume cheese and eggs while doing no direct harm to the animal itself. This is all fine and dandy until you consider that you are only using animal products derived from the female half of the animal population. So this means that male chickens or goats or cows have no value unless they are slaughtered for meat. So by economically endorsing the production of animal products (though not consuming their meat), you're still aiding in the slaughter or mistreatment of animals. But I'm not a vegetarian or vegan myself."
"CMV: Being vegan is pointless, why make your life less enjoyable?",gurduloo,0,"&gt;There seems like there is no reward to not [eating] any meat (my main point). You are really missing the point. Veganism isn't about doing what will benefit yourself. Vegans are motivated to avoid using animal products because they care about the wellbeing of animals, and recognize that using them as products is inconsistent with this. The vegan's concern is therefore directed outwards, toward the animal, not inward, toward themselves. So, whether the vegan will 'get anything out of it' is not the point for them."

"CMV: Being vegan is pointless, why make your life less enjoyable?",pooyah_me,0,"There are many reasons for deciding against using animal products. 1. Animal welfare: * [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcN7SGGoCNI) is a video of how the dairy industry works. Cows don't naturally produce milk their whole lives. They're mammals, so they produce milk after having a baby. To get around this, the industry constantly artificially inseminations them over and over for their entire lives using holsters called """"rape racks."""" As soon as the calves are born, they're taken from their mothers and are killed if they're males, while the females wait until they're old enough to also be constantly impregnated. This way, instead of giving the milk to the baby cows, humans can have it. Because of the stress and hormones from constantly being pregnant and losing their children, dairy cows' life spans drop from 12 to only 4-5 years. * [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkphooryVyQ) is a video of what happens to male chicks in the egg industry. Because they're useless (they can't produce eggs), they're ground alive the day they're born.

The environment: * Animal agriculture is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions, which is more than the combined exhaust from *all* transportation.

The reward is in knowing that you're taking a personal responsibility to reduce environmental waste and animal suffering, while spending less money on groceries, being healthier, and exploring new foods and recipes every day. &gt; Also, if we can survive not eating meat, how come in a survival situation people might resort to cannibalism and not eat grass? Sure, people might resort to cannibalism in some weird situation in a frozen tundra where there is no edible vegetation anywhere.

From your title I infer that you think an important goal in life is for it to be enjoyable. I would agree. But you are making two assumptions that are not necessarily correct: 1) a vegan diet is less enjoyable than a diet with meat and 2) diet is an important contributor to joy. Regarding the first assumption, not everyone enjoys the taste of meat, even if a majority does. Also, the average vegan eats a lot of things that the average meat-eater does not. Someone who eats meat is not restricted to try those vegan foods too, but in practice they rarely do. With your diet, your taste palette changes so it would be very hard to say, from where you're sitting, which diet is more enjoyable. I actually agree with the second assumption, tasty food does contribute to day-to-day happiness. But we've already established that taste is subjective, and furthermore, even if food is a factor in happiness, so is making choices that you perceive as ethical. Suppose a convinced vegan sat down to eat a steak and enjoyed the taste, but afterwards started feeling guilty about it. I'd say the feeling of guilt more than cancels out any joy from that dinner. And such feelings usually last a lot longer than the twenty minutes it took you to dine and savor the food. The main 'problem' with your joy-argument is the factor of empathy. Bear with me here. """"Life should be enjoyable"""" is an assertion most would agree with. Add the fact that non-human animals feel pain, just like we do so we empathize with them and you come to: """"Animals' lives should be enjoyable too"""". Even this assertion would rarely be contested, and most people apply it to their pets and animals who are perceived as 'cute'. Sometimes also to farm animals but only if it's 'practical'. All vegans do is take it half a step further and apply it to all animals. So in the end you get to """"All lives, human or animal, should optimally be enjoyable."""" We as humans, who have evolved to have empathy, get the choice to pick what's more important: our own joy, or that of an animal. Nearly everyone will pick their own joy if forced to choose, we're selfish after all. For the meat dilemma however, we need to quantify *how much* joy it brings us, and how that compares to the amount of suffering we have caused to attain it. Ethical (and environmental) vegans are people who have decided that the joy they get is not worth the suffering it causes. As a plus, they get joy out of the idea that they have made a kind, empathetic choice. In short: a vegan diet generally is only less enjoyable if you don't agree with the philosophy behind it. If you do agree, it's not so much a deprivation as it is a choice that can bring you extra joy as opposed to guilt."

"CMV: Being vegan is pointless, why make your life less enjoyable?",IceRollMenu2,0,"Enjoyment is something more complicated than mere pleasant bodily sensations.

I *enjoy* a plate of spaghetti because I'm having it with my friends whose company I value. And so on. To *enjoy* something means more than merely deriving immediate bodily pleasure from it – it also means *endorsing it as good*, it means *valuing it*. But vegans do not think that animals ought to be killed for food. They do not relate to the body of an animal in the way that would be required to enjoy eating it. So while they may have pleasant bodily experiences from eating an accidental bite of animal, they will absolutely not *enjoy* it. And this is why animals are not tempting to eat for vegans (but for plant-based dieters). To a vegan, there is no *enjoyment* to be gained from a dead animal – all they'd end up with is a guilty conscience and self-hate. So OP, if you want to convince vegans that they're """"missing"""" something, or that it's pointless for them to resist """"temptation,"""" you're missing the point. If you actually want to make that case, you have to argue that vegans ought to be able to enjoy eating dead animals, and for that you first need to argue that eating animals is not a bad thing.

These are great 'vegan starter questions', and here are some gut responses: &gt; """"Why would anyone give up eating meat? Millions of years of evolution made it delicious."""" This is correct: meat IS delicious to humans naturally, but this doesn't make it ethically acceptable to eat. Just because something is natural doesn't make it ethically right, and there are a host of obviously bad behaviours that evolution has instilled in humans. There is some evidence that rape and racism are evolutionarily-instilled traits, and definitely raw aggression and violence are. Does this justify rape, racism, or murder? Of course not. &gt; """"Also, if we can survive not eating meat, how come in a survival situation people might resort to cannibalism and not eat grass?"""" This seems more like a defense of cannibalism than a defense of meat-eating (and if this doesn't excuse purposefully killing humans for meat, why would it excuse purposefully killing animals for meat?). Either way, you're absolutely right: grass is inedible to us, and other humans ARE edible. But, since almost nobody lives in such a situation, for practically all of society, it's unethical to kill and eat other humans (or meat in general). &gt;""""It seems like there are no rewards for being vegan."""" Other than simply 'doing the right thing ethically' you are correct. I don't hold to the idea that Veganism is necessarily a healthier diet: I'm vegan simply because it's the right ethical choice to make. It's for the same reason that I don't own slaves, or steal from luxury stores. Do I get a reward for being a 'non-slave-owner'? Of course not. &gt; """"Even though most mammals have to eat other animals to survive."""" In the first place, this is not true: most animals are herbivores, not carnivores or omnivores. Even if it *were* true, it wouldn't have any bearing on the question. Many animals eat their own young. Does this make it acceptable for humans to eat their young? Of course not. Simply because most animals do it doesn't mean that it's an ethical action. Those are my responses: I hope they're helpful to you! Let me know if you have any further questions!"

"CMV: Being vegan is pointless, why make your life less enjoyable?",unicorn_gallop,0,"Many people benefit from vegan diets due to medical conditions. For example, my cousin has PKU. His body cannot break down protein. He has to avoid all foods that are high in protein and certain sugars - ie, ALL meat and animal products. The reward of a vegan diet to him is that he does not have severe brain damage, or any of the other complications of PKU. Vegan diets are only expensive if you eat a bunch of pre-packaged veggie burgers and sausage. But staples such as beans, rice, lentils, tofu, and pasta are among the cheapest food available in America. Vegan food is less risky when it comes to food borne illness. Salmonella and E coli are the biggest known cause of foodborne illness, and come from animals. (Plants contaminated with salmonella or e coli have been contaminated with animal sewage, anyways.) Raw meat and eggs are also much messier and more tedious to cook with than plant foods. It is very quick and easy to whip up a salad as opposed to de-thawing and cooking a steak to a meticulous internal temperature, and then needing to bleach everything it touches afterwards. Eating out is also generally more expensive than preparing food at home. Growing up on a farm, I can tell you animal farming is messy and disgusting. You have to deal with animal feces, urine, sweat, and other excretions, you have to deal with animals attacking and killing eachother or their handlers (or themselves), and you have to deal with animal corpses. Actually slaughtering the animal is a bloody affair as well, and there is plenty of opportunity for human illness and death. Even milking a cow has a risk of the cow kicking your head in. When considering how to responsibly use land and water, plant diets seem to make a lot more sense. Animals use a lot more land than plants. You also have to feed the animal plant food over an entire lifetime... that you could have just eaten yourself. You have to give the animal tons of water that you also could have just drank yourself. Animals create a lot more pollution and greenhouse gas emissions than plant food. _Who gives a shit about how a cow feels?_ I sure don't. But a vegan diet still makes a lot more sense than the alternative."

[Grass is not nutritious for humans](http://www.livescience.com/32435-why-cant-humans-eat-grass.html) and so we don't bother consuming it.. but I am sure you would agree that in a survival situation, if there is an option between eating a human and eating a plant that we CAN nutritionally digest (like carrots or beans), you bet your ass we're going to eat the plant rather than the human.. so your point is just invalid and pretty lazy here, sorry. &gt; It also seems like a vegan diet is very expensive. Chickpeas, beans, vegetables, potatoes - all cost buttons compared to the price of meat, and are all much more nutritious and very high in protein. I spend less and am much healthier as a vegan than before. I do feel like I am making a difference - but even if I wasn't, I could never consider myself so important that I feel I am worth the ruthless, painful slaughter of another living being just because it's """"delicious"""".

When I was a vegetarian I constantly got criticism from meat eaters - called a pussy, called a hippie, told I eat 'bird food,' dumb jokes like 'you eat my food's food,' questions about my morals 'How can you eat eggs if you don't eat meat?' etc. Keep in mind I only brought up being a vegetarian if someone asked or offered me meat, or if I was asking for vegetarian options in a group eating situation. Since I've eaten meat I've gotten a hard time from a vegetarian maybe once. I believe most vegitarians and vegans will back me up, the 'preachy' thing is a myth. I got preached at way more by meat eaters. Finally you claim vegetarians only eat that way because it makes them feel superior to others. I don't see how that is more selfish than eating something suffered and died because it gives you personal pleasure because it tastes good."
CMV:Vegans/vegetarians only care about themselves,Alejandroah,0,"I'm a meat eater, could never be vegan or vegetarian.. That being said I think you're looking at it wrong.

Yoy have to realize that fact and analyze their behavior on that basis if you had a friend who's constantly murdering innocent people, wouldn't you make a big deal out of it?? You would probably never shut up about it and you would probably shame them every chance you get, because you genuinly believe that their crime IS THAT BAD. You would genuibly feel guilty by doing nothing while they commit murder or talk about committing murder.. That's what goes through their minds, and that makes sense once we realize that for them, inside their heads, eating meat is just as bad as murder (mayhe almist asbbad, but still really really bad). bassically they're not thinking about themselves, they are actinf as anyone would act while witnessing a crime they consider THAT HORRIBLE."

CMV:Vegans/vegetarians only care about themselves,JRL2404,1,"I'm a vegan. Personally, I really enjoy meat and cheese. Foods like pulled pork, cheeseburgers, and pizza were my favorite foods growing up. However, I read some arguments about the unethical status of meat consumption and found them too compelling to ignore, which is why I gave all of that up. In particular, I gave it up because I realized my personal preference for meat was not as strong as the harm it was causing others for me to keep consuming it. So I'd say my decision to go vegetarian and later vegan was precisely not just caring about myself. It was the exact opposite of that, and I know I'm not the only one in the vegan world who made that kind of decision."

The moment the video says anything negative about a vegetarian lifestyle, the couple will mockingly laugh and immediately counter argue and say that it's flat out wrong. I didn't actually watch the video but I don't really understand why this is inappropriate. Why remark upon points that are, in their view, correct? Wouldn't that just be self-congratulatory? I imagine if the purpose of their show is to provide content for vegans and those interested in veganism, explaining misconceptions would be a main point of discussion, wouldn't it? As for the rest of your argument, in my experience as a vegetarian and on and off vegan, it's usually meat eaters who are eager to bring up my diet, ask excessive and intrusive questions, and try to justify themselves, when all I did was ask for there to not be cheese on my pasta. I suspect that this is because eating meat, dairy and eggs is a huge part of American and western culture, so people tend to see someone *not* doing those things as inherently attacking those who do. Meat eaters, in my experience, are the ones who seek to convince me that they're in the right for whatever reason. But that's the problem with personal experiences--they're personal. Maybe I've only ever interacted with crappy meat eaters. Maybe you've only interacted with crappy vegans. As for whether everyone becoming vegan is good for the world, I actually did my own [CMV](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4kkh79/cmv_the_entire_world_should_become_vegan/) on this recently and came away much more committed to veganism.

CMV:Vegans/vegetarians only care about themselves,withceres,1,"I normally don't mention my vegetarianism until it's relevant. As in, until someone literally asks me if I'm vegetarian because I'm eating very obviously vegetarian food. Most of the food I take to work is vegan and relies on tofu or chickpeas for protein. It's food I make in large batches and that I take to reheat. It's usually things like curries. Or alternatively it comes up for discussion on Reddit in a sensible and peaceful discussion like this. If someone offers me meat during the week (for instance, the monthly barbecue lunch) I will normally politely decline without any need to mention why. In truth, I'm what they call a 'weekday vegetarian', though I was vegetarian for the better part of a decade. I eat primarily vegan during the week and either vegetarian or more ethical (e.g. locally produced, free range, certain animals more than others) meats on weekends. I am well aware of the ASAPScience video and I wholly agree with the parts that describe the negative impacts of a sudden global switch toward vegetarianism. I don't believe everyone should be vegetarian, but I do believe people should reduce their consumption of meat. I believe this would benefit animals in agriculture tremendously. A lower demand and greater social appreciation for animal life could theoretically reduce the advantage to large scale animal abuse. I have no issue with eating an animal that has had a decent life. The kinds of things we do to animals in agriculture are truly horrific. I understand why it is necessary in the current social climate, but I still think it's tragic and needs to change. I honestly don't think I'm better than anyone for choosing to eat very little to no meat, and neither do the *majority* of vegetarians and vegans. Like with most interest groups, the vocal minority can and will ruin everything."

Even then, if I know that the place/meal they suggest will have a vegetarian option, I typically just go with the flow. I have been in a relationship with a man who eats meat for seven years now. Neither of us intend to change those decisions. I would of course be thrilled if he decided to stop eating meat, but I won't ask him to. The most I'll do is ask him to buy ethically-raised meats, eggs, etc whenever possible. This is something he strives to do anyway, so it's hardly even an ask. Now... are there super asshole vegans out there who will get up in your face about how great their diet is and how awful you are for not following it? Sure. Evangelists exist within every niche culture group, and because vegans are driven by what they see as a moral imperative, they're likely to be very passionate and willing to lay down some shame. It's like religious nuts who will shame women for having abortions because they see it as murder, or super-straight homophobes who shame men for being (or acting) gay, or people of any religious persuasion whose belief that theirs is the One True Religion drives them to hate others. It's all driven by the same thing -- the belief that one's position is morally superior, coupled with the desire that other people should follow the same moral code. Shame can be an effective means to that end, so I understand why people employ it. But my point is... like others have pointed out, there are lots of us V's who are invisible to you because we *don't* rub it in strangers' faces. We don't care what you do. Like, I do on some level -- I know that there are environmental harms that come from the meat industry, and I think that decreasing per capita meat consumption would reduce those harms and also improve public health -- but if you're a person in my life that I'm interacting with in some way and we don't have any reason to discuss food, and the topic of vegetarianism doesn't come up for some other reason, then I'm probably not even going to tell you that I am one. I'm *definitely* not going to spout off a list of reasons why I think you should change your lifestyle to be more like mine."

The collection of chemical reactions that organize into life is certainly a neat phenomenon, but do you have a moral obligation to respect a DNA molecule? What is wrong with pulling it apart, studying it, and putting it back together in interesting ways (e.g., oil eating bacteria for oil spills)? Therefore, it is entirely reasonable to draw the line of morality, not at """"life"""" (see, generally, Jainism), but at sentience. Once again definitions can vary, but in this context sentience is limited to those things that we have moral obligations to.

"CMV: Going vegan can be good for some people, but for the majority of the human race, it is not the most healthy, ethical, or enviormentally healthy way to live.",Casus125,0,"&gt; First off: It is a commo misconception that vegans are healthier than meat eaters. It is proven that vegans lack B12, Iron, and protein, unless they go out of their way to take special prescribed medications, vitamin tablets, and special plant foods that are fortified with these three chemicals. While i do not deny that it is POSSIBLE to be a healthy vegan (shit, they have vegan athletes after all!) to me it would not appear PROBABLE or EASY to do this. B12 is nearly the only proven fact you've got there actually - which can easily be rectified with fortified foods (Soy Milk, Tofu, numerous breakfast cereals, bread, Yeast, etc.) or even a simply supplement. Even then, there are non-fortified vegan sources of B12 (Mushrooms). Iron and protein are ridiculously easy to get in plant form, and hardly an issue. Just for some clarification. Mushrooms, breads, legumes, and nuts are vegan dietary staples. They are exceptionally probable, and stupidly easy to acquire, cook, and consume on a regular basis. &gt; Third off, it is detremental to our enviorment. Plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen, thus absorbing all that CO2 in the atmosphere that contributes to global warming. But if everyone became vegans, people would begin eating way too many plants, and there would less CO2 absorption. This is really, really ignorant of the situation. The cost of producing meat is significantly higher than the cost of producing edible vegetables. Because we have to feed animals plants first to get them to grow, and then we kill them for their meat. So we grow plants to be eaten, and then eat the things that eat those plants. Surely you can see that this is inefficient when we could just eat the plants in the first place, yes? [Livestock is estimated to contribute 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions.](http://www.fao.org/3/i3437e.pdf) Which is equal to or greater, depending on various studies, the entire transportation contribution to greenhosue gas emissions. [Beef creates 15kg of CO2 per 1kg of meat. Lamb 20. Pork 4. Chicken 2.](http://www.fao.org/3/i3437e.pdf) Meat also has an estimated 20% waste factor (as in, 20% of meat gets thrown away) at the super market in that same study. [12% of crops used to feed animals result in calories consumed by humans. It can take up to 30 crop calories to produce 1 caolorie of meat](http://discover.umn.edu/news/food-agriculture/existing-cropland-could-feed-4-billion-more) That seems a little inefficient no? Especially when we could just consume those plants directly. That's not even bringing into the issue of fresh water use, beans and lentils require five gallons of water per gram of protein produced, chicken nine gallons, and beef 29.6. Meat production creates more greenhouse gases, consumes more water, and provides less calories compared to direct plant consumption."
"CMV: Going vegan can be good for some people, but for the majority of the human race, it is not the most healthy, ethical, or enviormentally healthy way to live.",sydbobyd,0,"&gt; While i do not deny that it is POSSIBLE to be a healthy vegan to me it would not appear PROBABLE or EASY to do this. There's evidence to support that eating a plant based diet has many health benefits. If you're eating a reasonably varied diet based on whole foods, you shouldn't have to worry about getting enough nutrients, save for B12 which can easily be supplemented so that's hardly difficult. It's no harder to eat a healthy vegan diet than a healthy omnivorous diet.

It would seem a contradiction to me that we try to eleviate pain from one specise and not all of them, but if we did that, we would die, and that obviously wouldn't be beneficial to humanity as a whole, Veganism is not a dogmatic view that nothing should ever be killed. It's defined as: a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose. We kill bugs all the time, that doesn't make it ethical to go kill my neighbor. Veganism is about reducing harm. Nothing is completely cruelty free, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to reduce suffering where possible. Since eating animal products is unnecessary and causes harm, we can easily reduce suffering by simply abstaining from it. It's also important when talking about harm that you take into account the capacity for something to suffer and feel pain. I will eat a carrot over a cow because a cow suffers in a way a plant does not. For that matter, I'd eat an insect over a cow because I think a cow has a greater capacity to suffer than an insect. It's well established that a chicken or a cow or a pig all feels pain. The ethical question is, if I can reduce harm by not eating animal products and cause no detriment to myself, why should I eat them? As to environmental impact: &gt; a greater consumption of animal products translates to a greater impact on the environment...vegetarian and vegan diets could play an important role in preserving environmental resources and in reducing hunger and malnutrition in poorer nations.

Vegans do need to supplement B12 if they live in the modern world (although it's conjectured that this wouldn't be necessary if we ate """"wild"""" foods, but let's not get into that). The rest of your quoted claims are unsupported by evidence. This should not be too surprising. The modern world is somewhat nutritionally deficient in general. For a classic example: the US government food policy encourages vitamin D (the """"sunshine vitamin"""") added to dairy because of how far away the US is from the equator. The UK food policy is similar. You're taking vitamin supplements as an omnivore without even knowing it, so this shouldn't be a cornerstone of your argument for how healthy it may or may not be. Omnivores also suffer B12 deficiency and many are unaware since it's not tested during routine physicals. The USDA has concerns that up to 40% of the US population is skirting with B12 deficiency. Finally, it's true that """"junk food vegans"""" may be deficient in the ways you described, but junk food omnivores are too so it's a moot point for your argument."

It would seem a contradiction to me that we try to eleviate pain from one specise and not all of them, but if we did that, we would die, and that obviously wouldn't be beneficial to humanity as a whole, and seeing as no other specise has any conception of ethicality or morality, us being dead wouldn't contribute to ethics as a whole in any meaningful or positive way. We do not kill cows and fishes by happenstance. We consciously breed them, raise them, and kill them. It's a conscious thing, not the byproduct of another action. &gt; Third off, it is detremental to our enviorment. Plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen, thus absorbing all that CO2 in the atmosphere that contributes to global warming. But if everyone became vegans, people would begin eating way too many plants, and there would less CO2 absorption. More CO2 = more global warming. Entirely false. Animal farming is one of the main source of CO2 emissions. A vegetarian is actually killing less plants that a meat-eater does."

I believe that it is not morally obligatory to be a vegetarian. CMV.,linxiste,0,"&gt;Basically, the question is whether animals have rights, and more broadly, what the source of rights is. There is no intrinsic obligation to give equal rights to all sentient beings, on my view, but only to sentient beings who are capable of reasoning. What is it about the ability to reason that endows the beholder with rights? Here is a quote from Jeremy Bentham, an early advocate of utilitarian ethics: """"What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog, is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?"""" People who say that animals shouldn't have the same rights because they do not have the same mental faculties as humans pick that reason not because it is logical (ironically), but because it is convenient. Now, personally I don't believe that the consumption of meat should be prohibited. Rather, I think that farms should be held to more humane standards."
I believe that it is not morally obligatory to be a vegetarian. CMV.,UltimateUbermensch,0,"""""I acknowledge that we should not be unnecessarily cruel to animals, but this is because being cruel to animals would make us more brutal toward each other."""" If a moral theory cannot explain straightforwardly that gratuitous cruelty to animals is wrong because gratuitously inflicting suffering harms the interests of the recipient-animal, then that moral theory is flawed. Basically an egoistic moral theory that requires the revisions and modifications necessary to give the right answers for the right reasons, might barely look like egoism strictly speaking in the end. What's interesting is why, upon a serious investigation into what Rand means by """"egoism,"""" she calls it egoism at all. Her """"new concept of egoism"""" has to do with the achievement of one's """"rational self-interest"""" but once you look into her concept of """"rational"""" and """"interests"""" and her (rather strong!) case that there aren't conflicts of interests among rational people, you have something you could call a eudaimonistic individualism but not something that unproblematically can be called an egoism. Once morally plausible things like empathetic identification and respect for other moral subjects are built into her conception of rational interests, I don't see what's at stake by insisting on the term """"egoism."""" """"Egoism"""" correctly understood advocates something more or less like, """"My personal interests are the ultimate overriding consideration in how I live my life,"""" but if """"interest"""" (plausibly) includes motivation based on respect or concern for others for their own sake - e.g., that we can simply and straightforwardly see that gratuitous infliction of suffering is a bad thing for the recipient of the treatment - then you end up with a version of """"egoism"""" that doesn't even resemble the motivations of someone driven only by consideration of what's best for themselves. (And a plausible eudaimonist ethics that resembles a self-actualization view of human well-being will rather obviously incorporate a social dimension into what it is for a human to self-actualize or flourish.) One possible move for the """"egoist"""" at this point is to say that any moral considerations or principles that justify the pursuit of his own interests must do so generally or inductively for other interest-having beings - that I am an instantiation of a general principle and not some kind of solipsistic exceptionalist in which """"only my interests matter morally."""" (That's the usual straw-man version of Rand's ethics presented by intellectually lazy or malicious critics.) This would preclude me, from the standpoint of rational consistency, from inflicting gratuitous pain on others since I couldn't rationally allow such treatment of myself given the inductively generated principle. At that point a Randian would have to recognize a kinship with Kantian moral reasoning (the actual kind, not the straw-man version that many critics of Kant lazily or maliciously accept). This move by the """"egoist"""" would be pretty much fine and good within an eudaimonist ethical framework but its reasoning doesn't actually look egoist in an interesting sense. My recommendation for the Randian is to acknowledge the problematic implications of calling her ethics an """"egoist"""" given its actual substance, the latter being a theory that actually overcomes the traditional egoist/altruist dichotomy as unacceptable for ethics, and grounding ethics upon the correct form of respect for individuals and interest-having beings in general. I mean, isn't it plainly obvious that you just shouldn't inflict gratuitous pain on sentient beings, just given the nature of values as Rand herself described them? """"Respect for life"""" should be front and center of her normative perspective, if you want to get anything like her ethics of (one's own) life (qua man) as the standard of moral value from it."

Hold on now, all being a vegetarian is is not doing something. The burden of proof actually falls on the person doing a thing to justify that thing as being morally permissible. Every time you kill an animal or buy a meat product, you contribute directly or indirectly to the suffering of animals (I personally don't believe the actual consumption of meat is morally relevant in and of itself). It's not my job to explain why you shouldn't do that, it's your job to explain why you can. The problem is, there is no compelling moral consideration (even by the moral standards of egoism) that renders eating meat okay. It's not good for the environment, it's not good for other people, it's not good for the animals, and most importantly (apparently) it's not good for you. So why is it morally permissible for you to continue eating meat?"
I believe that it is not morally obligatory to be a vegetarian. CMV.,KerSan,0,"Speaking as a vegan for more than three years, I can tell you why I consider it a moral imperative for me to remain vegan. I am not against killing, per se. I think that in order to live, we must kill. When I slice an onion, for example, I think that the squirting of burning chemicals is the onion's scream of death. Plants communicate using chemicals, after all. What I am against is torture. People in the western world have this scary habit of eating meat with every meal, which is completely at variance with both historical eating habits and the eating habits of non-first-world countries. It is very expensive to produce meat. The reason that meat is so cheap in the western world is because of two things: subsidies, and factory farming. The industrial revolution made manufactured goods very cheap to obtain because of economies of scale. This also happened with meat. Meat is plentiful because meat is treated as a commodity, so the efficiency of meat production is ensured by highly efficient industrial process. This process, however, pays almost no attention to animal welfare. Chickens that produce eggs are kept in battery cages for their entire short lives. Their beaks are sawn off to ensure that they do not peck at each other or at the cage that does not even give them enough room to turn around. They often have distended colons, which is extremely painful and makes them prone to life-threatening infections that are controlled by huge doses of antibiotics. Pigs are transported in trucks that don't have safety harnesses. Many pigs suffer broken bones and other injuries when they are being transported for slaughter. The time allowed to kill an animal before industrialized slaughter is often not enough to ensure that the animal is actually dead before being butchered. It's impossible to get reliable figures since slaughterhouses are extremely secretive, but animal rights groups have investigated many times and have produced figures as high as 40% for the number of animals that are *alive when they are being butchered*. The important point is that if you are purchasing animal products, **you are paying for all of this**. That is to say, *this is being done for you*. If you pay to have someone killed, you are at fault. If you pay someone to subject animals to life-long torture, it's your fault. Do not pass the buck. You are the consumer, and you have demonstrated time and again that you are willing to pay for such pervasive cruelty. Don't tell me you don't support it if you do. The only support that matters is cold hard cash. If you really believe in morality, quit paying people to torture animals. It's just not right."

Basically, not so much the death of the animal but the conditions it endures while it is alive. But, the death does matter as well. There are humane ways to kill an animal, and inhumane ways. Do you know the humane ways to kill an animal? Have you been trained in how to use, say, a stun gun? Has your boyfriend's father explained to you how to kill a chicken so that it does not suffer unduly? I rather doubt it, if he's insisting you help out. Which says to me, he doesn't really care about those issues. I can't really imagine that someone who cares about the suffering their animals may or may not be suffering would put the job of killing them in the hands of someone who is entirely unsuited for the job. Here's a question for you. You tried to be a vegetarian in the past, but had some health issues. Why? There is no reason why a vegetarian diet should cause those issues. Perhaps you were not eating enough? Perhaps you were missing some important nutrients in your diet? It could be that there are some foods you avoid or don't like to eat that have important nutrients that you'd otherwise get from meat. Try going vegetarian again, with, say, multivitamin support. See if that helps. Talk to a nutritionist perhaps, if even with the multivitamins you are having problems. There are many options."

I live an active life, I get good grades in college, never have any health problems, I'm fit, and I never get dizzy spells. You can get your protein and iron from loads of other foods out there. Being a vegetarian takes more responsibility than just blindly eating what ever you want. Do a little research first before you diss it. People that say that they *need* meat are delusional. You just *want* it. I'm pretty sure that hamburgers and steaks are good, but I don't think that raising animals poorly and slaughtering them inhumanely is justified so my taste buds can be happy for 10 minutes. Meat is processed to the point where it's not even real meat anymore. They add so much shit and chemicals to it that at it completely defeats the purpose of the supposed """"it's natural and healthy"""" thing. Maybe it's just my preference, but I just don't see the appeal of eating meat. I look at hotdogs and meatballs and other meat foods and they don't look appetizing to me. I can't get passed the fact that the thing I'm eating used to be a living &amp; breathing animal. It seems somewhat selfish to me. I am also a huge animal lover. Sure, I may love cats and dogs more than farm animals. But that doesn't mean I don't think they deserve any less quality of life than humans do. It shouldn't matter if it's someones pet or not. For example in the Western world we idolize cats and dogs. But in China they see them as food and don't keep them as pets. What I'm trying to get at is why do some cultures view some animals as food and we don't? There isn't a difference between a pig, chicken, cat, or dog. Animals and people are equal.

CMV: Veganism halts evolutionism.,Xrave,0,"Your argument hinges on a few points: 1. eating (hunting/killing) signifies dominance 2. evolution relevance is related to dominance. Neither are particularly true. For instance, to unseat humans from evolutionary platform requires a planetary genocide that cuts off human knowledge gathering and completely reduces everyone to prior-to-caveman level, and then a second species would move into the vacuum. It's not required for this species to actually *eat* humans. Dominance does not require eating. 99% of human beings do not eat monkeys or other primates, our closest competitors in intelligence; nor do they eat lions/leopards, top of their respective food chain. The fact that we evolved to compete better with other food-chain-topping predators shows that we don't have to dominate them to evolve. So, veganism does not halt evolution. It might be a negative trait that's selected against, or just a random trait that doesn't feel evolutionary pressure, but pressures elsewhere in our environment drive us to evolve far more than our day to day palettes. Besides, veganism is not genetic (citation needed). (Allergy-caused veganism is exception) There's no point discussing evolution (which concerns with selective pressure on passing of genes) when the root of veganism is an 'ideal'. Of course, evolution in terms of memes (selective pressure in passing on of ideas) exists, but here it is not meaningful because there isn't a different species with intelligence matching us to compete ideologically."

CMV: The argument for veganism stating that animal products aren't ours to use is an invalid argument.,howbigis1gb,0,"Leaving aside the question of whether animals have a sense of self or not, in many cases they will defend certain things from being taken by others. Animals claim territory all the time. They have claimed it as theirs, and as such I am not sure it is relevant whether they have a sense of self or not - as they do seem to have a desire to stop others from taking ownership of that thing. Basicaally - do you think it is important to have a sense of """"this is mine"""" to have a sense of """"this is not yours""""? Similarly bees will defend their colony from attack, and try to stop """"strangers"""" from taking their honey."
CMV: The argument for veganism stating that animal products aren't ours to use is an invalid argument.,klw,0,"My argument against egg and wool """"ownership"""" has more to do with practicality than philosophy. I'm an animal lover and I have plenty of distaste for cruel farming techniques, but I think it would be unethical to abandon domesticated species because of arguments like the ones you describe. However, I also disagree with your argument because I think that it relies too much on things that humans either don't or can't know rather than pure practicalities. I'll try to explain. &gt;I think this argument is invalid because animals are not independent moral beings with a sense of self. That's true, we mostly think this for most animals. For certain species we can't really be absolutely positive. Some primates *seem* to display a sense of morality and fairness, for example, but we can't really *know* for sure. Orca have brain parts that humans don't possess. The brain structure of cephalopods is almost alien. This amorphousness makes its use as an argument difficult for both sides of the issue to debate. So why not skip over it and head right for the heart of the matter. For animals that humans created through husbandry, you don't even have worry overmuch about wool and egg ownership or sentience or rights or anything of that nature for very practical reasons. Humans carefully bred many of these animals to be dumb, docile, and dependent on human care. For example, if every sheep farmer just stopped shearing their sheep because the wool belongs to the sheep, the animals would be miserable. They'd be wool-blind, prone to heat stress, and could get weighed down by matted, dirty wool. That's because we bred these animals to *not shed*. Wild sheep relatives shed their wool every year. Without regular shearing, domesticated sheep would be sad, sad creatures. (Of course we shouldn't kick them or cut them when shearing.) But we made these sheep. We should care for them. Unlike the undomesticated red jungle fowl, domesticated chickens are generally incapable of flying into trees to escape predators or roost overnight. Which makes sense, because humans would want a bird they could easily keep around. You can't steal a hen's unfertilized egg because she abandons any eggs that don't hatch. Since egg collecting humans can easily control fertilization through access to roosters, taking a hen's unfertilized egg is like taking someone's used tampon out of the bin on trash day. She wouldn't want it even if she had a philosophy degree. And speaking of chickens, domesticated roosters have lost one of most attractive features to potential mates in jungle fowl--a complex hierarchy of warning calls that help hens defend their egg clutches. Roosters basically just crow occasionally. They do still have their spurs, however, and will use them. But if we left roosters and hens to their own devices they would likely disappear due to starvation and predation. Same story with dog breeds. You could probably """"free"""" most the working dog breeds and the brighter ones would eventually return to more wolf-like behaviors after many generations, but you would never see a ton of grizzled stray pugs, bulldogs, etc. That's because humans have bred them in such a way that they're literally dependent upon human care in order to survive. A pug can have heat stroke on a relatively mild early fall day. He's not going to get along well on his own. Dogs with hair instead of fur coats suffer in the elements. And so on. For undomesticated species, like bees, the ownership argument falls apart because humans are just another animal. Bears don't get arrested by other bears for breaking into beehives, and humans don't clap cuffs on bears for eating honey and bee larvae. Bees have defense mechanisms to protect their hives, and some animals, like bears and humans, are wily or tough enough to get around them. It's the way of the world. Apiculturists want healthy bee colonies, and would never collect so much honey that the colony would starve in the winter, so they stop honey collection at a certain point in order to give the bees enough time to stock up for winter. The bees aren't missing anything. They're eating and being bees. You don't have to argue that a bee is or is not a moral, self-aware creature in the face of such practicalities.

It doesn't matter how aware they are, it's just wrong. The truth is that we just give human certain rights that we don't give to other animals.

If I could guerentee that that animals that I ate had had a 'life worth living' and then were killed in a swift and humane manner, then that would be ok with me. SO I switched from vegetarian, which I view as being a passive observer. As a vagatarian I'm not affecting anything, just opting out entirely.

CMV: I don't believe being vegetarian is doing anything positive for animals.,thenoblepenguincorn,0,"For me, vegetarianism didn't come out of the idea that animals shouldn't be eaten. I totally get that by nature we are designed to eat animals. But we aren't eating animals now the way we were designed to. If we hunted animals and killed them, then that is justifiable. With the horrendous practices of our factory farms, we are forcing animals through horrible inhumane conditions through their entire torturous life before we slaughter and eat them. To me, it's not the slaughter but the means by which we get there. So when I stopped eating meat, I originally would still eat meat if it was ethically raised, but that kind of meat is really expensive (It's actually at a reasonable price for supporting a humane life for an animal before killing it.) I ate it very rarely. Eventually I realized that I had gone long enough without eating meat that I really didn't have to anymore and nothing sentient had to die for my sustenance. As for eating predators, I kind of disagree with you there. While they aren't at the top of the food chain, many of the animals we eat are predators to something, while still being prey to us. Chickens, for instance, predominantly eat insects if I'm not mistaken. The fact that someone is eating a mountain lion means that mountain lion is their prey. If you think that's not fair because it didn't stand a chance against a rifle, then I don't see how that is different from eating an animal killed with any other tool."

CMV: I don't believe being vegetarian is doing anything positive for animals.,n0ggy,0,"The reasoning is this: * It has been proven by science that animals are being capable of sensitivity, emotions, and aren't willing to die * We are sentient beings capable of morality. We can empathize with the suffering of another person or species, and we can act in accordance. * In the western world, a vegetarian diet can provide you with ALL the nutrients you need and eating meat is absolutely not more expensive nor necessary. Consequently, vegetarians believe that it is wrong to eat animals because we have an alternative and we are intelligent enough to understand animal suffering. Wild predators do not have an intellectual understanding of morality, some of them are carnivorous and therefore biologically wired to eat meat (contrary to omnivorous who """"can"""" eat meat but non """"need"""" to), and omnivorous predators often lack the food quantity and choice that we have. For these reasons, the moral imperative does not apply to them. As humans, we cannot hide behind the """"[Appeal to nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature)"""" argument unless you are willing to follow it in all situations. You kill someone? Law of the jungle. A disabled person gets mugged? Survival of the fittest. Nature's Law is amoral but we are not. We can't summon it as a joker card when it fits our agenda because any honest person should admit that living in a society ruled by nature's law would be pretty damn horrible. Another point you raise is the """"They'd be killed anyway"""". I don't think you fully realize how many animals are killed by us. Between 60 and 140 BILLIONS animals are killed each year by man.

The lower your involvement in what is happening, the lower is your moral responsibility, even if the end result is a dead person in all 3 cases. * We also pretty much universally agree on that animals are not moral actors, so there's no moral problem with a cat eating a mouse. * There's also that we're capable of creating environments that are much worse than nature. Yes, that mouse won't have a fun time when the cat pounces on it, but the cat will be done with it fairly quickly.

This is an unsupported (and as far as I can tell, incorrect) assumption, and without it the rest of your **economic** argument falls apart. And I say economic because you are focused on the potential utility costs of the diet, but that's not what wholly goes into an **ethical** position, which your argument is supposed to be about (""""only talking about people who are vegetarians/vegans for ethical reasons""""). An ethical argument can be much more nuanced than straight up monetary utility. As an easy example, many mentally and/or physically impaired people are overall drains on the economy -- is it ethical to kill them off to reallocate resources elsewhere? What of the elderly or chronically ill? If a vegetarian believes that right-to-life is a cornerstone of their ethical framework, and that animals should be afforded this right similar to humans, then they can ethically believe that animals should not be terminated even if society must bare some cost by changing diet. Of course, I think one would be hard pressed to support an argument that eating meat is cheaper than eating vegetarian. There are plenty of dirt cheap vegetarian sources of cheap protein (such as rice&amp; beans, buckwheat, soy products, etc.), and a large segment of the impoverished world makes due with these staples and very little meat."

You have to take money/food from people to be vegan: Exactly the opposite is true.

For example, I can make four """"hamburgers"""" out of a single can of black beans (75 cents) plus some bread crumbs and diced onion.

Earlier human beings will eat to survive, eating is natural to replenish the energy lost from hunting/speaking/redditing etc. The primary source for all animals and plants is our Sun, plants convert the solar energy (photosynthesis) into food which is in turn eaten by animals, and plants were their source of energy. Humans are the best known species to survive because we quickly adapted to eat both plants and animals for our energy. In the early days with limited farming or difficult weather conditions or migrators across continents food supply was limited to what we could grow and subsequently catch and eat. Current modern conditions where we have abundance of energy sources (food via plants). We are not subject to the vagaries of nature. Animals would always be considered a secondary source of energy because they first have to eat the plants and then eaten by human. When we have the capability to go the primary source of energy (we cannot photosynthesis) why would we have to eat animals? With the current state of agriculture a balanced diet of plants (vegan), gives us a complete source of energy. Everything in our modern society is based on moderations. Eating plants does not necessarily mean we are healthy, did the person also moderate smoking, drinking and basic exercises like walks/yoga. One important benefit, when we eat plants only we are preventing any secondary infections or complications that might have being present in the animals that have eaten the plants. Most of new health scares are because of various issues found in the animal kingdom (think bird flu, mad cow disease).

No decrease in any studied cancer rates or general longevity though (this may be due to [excessive](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3614697/) anti-oxidant [consumption](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952083/) actually, as once the anti-oxidants run out of oxidants to anti they start doing damage. There's also hormesis theory of carcinogen exposure that show a low level of exposure is necessary to keep the repair and prevention mechanism active similar to how disease exposure &amp; vaccines keep the immune system strong.

Veganism is a social rights movement that will continue to gain the momentum it has in the past few years, as good people realize that what is normal isn't necessary. Animals deserve at least some basic level of respect that the law currently doesn't cover. As soon as some very minimal laws are passed, such as the right of an animal to its own life, and factory farms can't kill the animals anymore, and meat starts to come very quickly off supermarket shelves, many people will think about this more and realize that while yes meat is tasty, it's also a needless killing.

Because animal protein and cholesterol promote IGF-2 release which directly causes cancer. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30gEiweaAVQ&amp;index=2&amp;list=FLIYLDTtCjdjtwphyjolBQBg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0IhZ-R1O8g&amp;index=1&amp;list=FLIYLDTtCjdjtwphyjolBQBg I know it's long but, like I said, no one can argue with evidence-based claims as long as the research is solid.

"CMV: The """"health argument"""" for veganism is invalid.",jaykayesss,0,"Although vegan diets aren't automatically healthier, it is easier to make a regular vegan diet healthier than a regular non-vegan diet. If you are limited to things without animal products, you end up eating more natural things and mainly vegetables and such to sustain you.

"CMV: The """"health argument"""" for veganism is invalid.",themcos,0,"I would agree with you if someone used that as the *only* argument for veganism. If someone said, """"You should become a strict vegan because it's healthier"""", that wouldn't be a very good argument. But is that what anyone is saying? Every vegan I've ever encountered has used one of your first two arguments as the primary motivation. When the health argument comes up, it's often as a valid rebuttle to the *anti-vegan* argument that meat is necessary to a healthy diet. Or, it's an """"icing on the cake"""" type argument, along the lines of, you should go vegan because of these reasons, and on top of that, it's even healthier than your current diet. Finally, for both the ethical and ecological arguments, it doesn't have to be all or nothing. Both of those arguments are still compelling even if they encourage a person to get *closer* to veganism, even if they don't go all the way. Eating meat on Tuesday is ethically and ecologically better than eating meat every day, even if the person can't claim to be a vegan. In this sense, a vegan accomplishes their goals even if they are using an argument that leads *closer* to veganism without getting all the way there. The optimal diet in terms of health almost certainly involves less animal products than a typical non-vegan consumes, even if it's not strictly vegan. And if you can convince someone to get closer to a vegan diet for health reasons, it becomes easier to go the extra mile and cut out meat entirely. I definitely believe a vegan can take this line of reasoning while still be totally honest about things. Tldr; I.don't think the health argument can fully stand on its own as an argument for vegan diets, and if a vegan makes factually incorrect claims, then shame on them, but taken as a part of a larger argument, the health argument has a lot of valid uses in the project of turning people vegan."

It's like eating garbage. Meat eaters seem to think it's heresy to say that I hate bacon, but it's subjective. What tastes good isn't an objective fact. As for a more robust argument, working with constraints often makes the end result better than having to constraints. If you have to make something without the benefit of meat and dairy, you have to focus way more on spicing, texture, and quality of ingredients to make a good meal. This results in vegan dishes emphasizing different things than meat dishes, which can be refreshing in comparison to a more traditional meat and potatoes kind of meal."

There are lots of individual people, each believing their actions to be insignificant and thus not adjusting them, even though if everyone changed their actions despite them being insignificant there would be a large significant change. Kant's categorical imperative is relevant here -- if everyone simply used logic and universalized their views, you wouldn't have a problem of insignificant changes not adding up because everyone would be making those changes. What it amounts to is that you should only worry about you, and take the actions that yield the best results if everyone else were to take them. That alone justifies vegetarianism even if it seems like it has an insignificant effect from just one person doing it. Note that I'm not a vegetarian, but it's not because I don't find this logic compelling; it's simply that I don't particularly care about non-human animals."

Yes, a majority of the population purchases unhealthy food from awful companies. Is this on purpose? Probably not, given people's reactions to seeing animals they plan on putting into their bodies laying in piss and feces. When most people become informed of the conditions of the food they eat before they eat it, they will look for other places to eat. They make regulations that force a level of health standards that must be met to make the food marketable. The general population doesn't care, but the *informed* population usually does, and that's a good distinction. People generally want better conditions for their food, animal or plant. They want it to be the best animal or plant they could put into their system. Businesses understand that very well, so they spend billions on confusing and misleading the population through effective competitive marketing to continue passing savings to their customers. To an extent, yes, it's the meat consumers fault that these things happen. However, if the food these consumers purchased were anything like the pictures they see when they buy it, these problems would be significantly reduced by good business practices.

And that that shipment causes the food distributor to order more turkeys? And that that shipment causes a farm to slaughter more turkeys?"""" The number of animals produced and slaughtered is so high that the very small probability of you sparing an animal from it still translates to 50-100 animals per year. And in my opinion, that's significant.

CMV: The contribution of vegans/vegetarians and other environmentally conscious people is absolutely insignificant.,ClimateMom,0,"I agree with /u/huadpe that simply the act of being vegetarian/vegan makes it easier for other people to reduce their meat consumption, because as the population of vegetarians and vegans expands, restaurants are offering more and better vegetarian/vegan options, including some that are so tasty only the most rabid carnivores would turn their nose up at them. The growing number of people with vegetarian/vegan friends and family members also means that more people are being exposed to delicious vegetarian/vegan food and even learning how to cook it, all of which chips away at the all-too-common notion that any meal without meat isn't worth eating. Helping society at large reduce its meat consumption is really important because meat production has such an enormous environmental impact, especially with regard to climate change. The exact contribution of animal agriculture to climate change is disputed, but the most widely accepted statistics seem to put animal agriculture at about 15-25% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, with some estimates reaching as high as nearly 50%. While it certainly is possible to raise meat in a sustainable and environmentally healthy way, in practice 78% of beef, 95% of pork, and 99% of chicken is raised in factory farms, so getting people to eat less meat overall is very important. Even a 10% reduction in overall meat consumption could make a significant difference. According to the Earth Day Network, if everybody in the U.S. did not eat meat or cheese for just one day a week, it would be the equivalent of not driving 91 billion miles.

And once they do so, even meat-eaters may end up ordering those dishes just because they're appealing, even if they'd ordinarily order meat. Essentially, in 1985, if you went to a moderately upscale restaurant, the vegetarian option was something like rice and steamed vegetables. No meat-eater would ever order that because blech. But the restaurant didn't bother improving it because a tiny tiny fraction of people were vegetarians. In 2015, because there are more vegetarians, there might be a few options such as a pasta with mushrooms or a chickpea curry.

All of these questions need to be examined by looking at their aggregate effects which each person is involved in. One's choice to eat or not eat meat does, in this way, has moral weight. I'm not going to dive into the ethics of eating animals because that is a more difficult subject to tackle and I don't think it is absolutely clear that we shouldn't be eating animals.

Meat requires far more energy, water, greenhouse gases and pollution, than a comparable amount of vegetables. It sounds like you agree with that, but I can provide sources if you want. 2. Every single vegetarian and vegan person means less meat is consumed, which leads to less meat being produced. Every one of those people has therefore had *some* positive effect on the world, although small. 3. But the amount of vegetarian and vegan people is rising. It's rising for many reasons, but one is the already large community of such people - it's easier to be a vegetarian when at least some of your friends and family are. So every vegetarian and vegan person helps get more people on board with not eating meat. The effect is therefore both **direct** - less meat is produced for the individual vegetarian - and **indirect** - more people are encouraged to also not eat meat. Clearly, if the whole world were vegan or vegetarian, the positive impact on the environment would be massive. We are just at a few % that currently are, so the impact seems small. But those people are driving a growing trend. These things take time, so we might not always feel it, and I understand why you wrote what you did. But that % will reach 10%, then 20%, 30%, and so forth. At those numbers, the ecological benefits will be very, very noticeable.

Universal vegetarianism would result in similarly impressive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. What’s more, the Dutch researchers found that worldwide vegetarianism or veganism would achieve these gains at a much lower cost than a purely energy-focused intervention involving carbon taxes and renewable energy technology.

CMV: The contribution of vegans/vegetarians and other environmentally conscious people is absolutely insignificant.,Deezl-Vegas,0,"Hey dude, figured I'd chime in. First of all, it's simply incorrect to reduce a small effect to zero. A simple example is adding a joker deck of cards. The joker won't appear in most games of blackjack or poker that you play unless you have about ten friends over, but when it does, it has a non-negligible impact that any gambler would be foolish to ignore. Another example is voting. Strictly speaking, your vote makes absolutely no difference in the presidential election. However, because you voted, your name, age, gender, and issues become entered into the average. Secondly, human beings are a species that tends to copy one another. We get it from monkeys. Sure, we use reason, but we tend to copy our fellow primates a bit when we're not thinking. In fact, a number of studies show that most people act essentially the same as the average of their five closest friends as far as personality or likelihood to take a specific action. So when on person effects a change of lifestyle or philosophy, it tends to resonate within the group. Some don't accept it, some do, but even the ones that don't will think about it and add it to their repository of ideas to consider. For instance, when you were served a veggie dish at the wedding, the catering department had to fire less of the meat in the main courses. Catering departments *only prep and cook food that they'll need for the event*. This is a very strict rule; any catering department that's throwing away pans of salmon is throwing away an equivalent amount of money. Instead, they'll use the remainder for future catered events or their restaurant side business. I worked in a fancy restaurant/catering spot and the staff would get to eat any food that couldn't be preserved, generally, which means they didn't have to buy something to eat when they got off. There was usually a few pans of potatoes and half a tray of one of the main dishes left -- that's about ten courses or so of """"waste"""". So you being a vegetarian at the wedding did save about one meal's worth of meat from someone else. We can call it half a meal. We can argue about the morality of killing stuff and eating it another day, but that's my case for being a vegetarian."

I'm pretty sure this is totally wrong. A billion is 1/7th of the world's population. Supposedly, 4-8% of the world's population is vegetarian, so there are 6,600,000 meat eaters, approximately. If a billion people stopped eating meat, that could cut the world's meat consumption by 15%. Yes, you've not stopped people from eating meat, but now nearly a quarter of the world is vegetarian, and that's definitely going to affect the meat production (even moreso if you take into account the non-meat foods that will have to increase in production, it seems likely that some livestock farms will be used for this instead). Will one vegetarian stop the world from eating meat? Of course not. Is one vegetarian insignificant? Probably. Are vegetarians as a whole making a difference? I certainly think so. In the UK, around 10% of people are vegetarian, but nearly a quarter of the population identifies as being """"meat reducers"""", i.e. they try to eat less meat, for health or ethical reasons. Now consider [this graph](http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/65895000/gif/_65895272_food_consumption_624-02.gif), which shows how much meat is being bought. Although chicken &amp; ready meals have increased, you can see the general decrease in the other meats (remember that chicken is often considered different to beef, pork, etc., on account of it being a white meat, and so is not always included in a meat-avoider's diet). Now, this may be at least partially due to health, but I think it's certainly vegetarians who are spreading awareness. Also consider that meat alternatives like quorn have only been produced on such a scale because many vegetarians buy it. It has now been adopted by many people, not just vegetarians, in an effort to improve health, reduce fat consumption, and as a result reduce meat consumption. Yes, the world isn't going to change overnight, but I think vegetarians and vegans are having quite a large role in the trend of reduced meat consumption."

Omnivores are now lessening their amount of meat in their diet, and even more people are turning vegan and vegetarian or just """"I don't eat meat very often""""-etarian, and it has gone to the point when arranging some events the crew don't even ask who is vegetarian, who is vegan anymore. They just simply offer vegan food for everyone instead, unless someone explicitly specify that they need meat, or whatever. Since meat need approximately ten times as much land to produce the same amount of food as veggies, and meat production is said to stand for close to 20% of the amount of climate change gases, this may have an enormous effect. Not very much for each veg*n by themselves, but due to the effect they have in motivating each other, motivating others, making selling veggies plausible for restaurants, and in the end have a so much larger effect on the world than they ever would by themselves. It's pretty much like voting, except they/we do it every day, so the possible effect is probably a lot larger."

CMV: Veganism in America is a privileged white value and as such should be considered ignorant.,dmikalova,0,"According to the UN, in their paper called """"Livestock's Long Shadow"""", animal agriculture is the number one cause of environmental degradation, freshwater usage, rainforest deforestation, species extinction, and greenhouse gas emissions. People who consume livestock are already making it impossible for poor people to live. Veganism has a rich white person problem, but it's not fundamental to the cause - feminism and gay rights have the same problem but at least mainstream feminism is trying to move past that. Vegans need to consider all of these issues and realize holistic approaches. Which in some cases they do - for example PETA pushing anti-whaling legislation that respects native cultures by exempting them. Look up Direct Action Everywhere's criticism of PETA's racism in their dog meat coverage. None of what you brought up really discounts the animal rights movement, it simply discounts the people in the AR movement who have failed to recognize the privilege of being able to go vegan - just like how some people have the privilege to be publicly feminist or queer. Also, just because someone's wrong about bees or manure doesn't mean their overall efforts of trying to be better isn't right, nor is someone who doesn't make mistakes because they didn't try any more right."

It's literally in the definition of veganism that the practice is only meant to be done as far as is practical and possible. Maybe you have a problem with some vegans that you know, but veganism defined respects that practicalities precede absolutes. Not that I've ever heard a single vegan ever say, gee I wish all those starving Africans would stop eating so much meat. Do you know what many truly impoverished people eat? [Here's photos of people's weekly groceries, from around the world](http://time.com/8515/hungry-planet-what-the-world-eats/). This is simply because it's so much cheaper to live on vegetables. I can buy 10 pounds of potatoes for $4, almost as cheap for rice; and how does that compare to the cost of meat? I recognize the main food-related problem for disadvantaged Americans is that they simply don't have time to cook, and in that situation I could care less about what exactly they're eating because I'd rather focus on living wages, good public transportation, and universal healthcare - because of course my compassion for living beings extends to all my fellow humans. Vegans typically are especially sensitive to the fact that we live in a dying plane; ie. to live, other living beings must die. Every time I drive a car, bugs are killed. Tiny bacteria live and die in my gut. All the bugs and animals that die so that my produce can be created; I am aware of all of these things. Veganism is not a way to pretend that this all isn't true. But just because I can't alter reality, doesn't mean I won't try to reduce to the greatest extent possible the amount of suffering of other living beings. Yes I live a privileged life, and it is my joy to say, yeah I'd rather as few animals as possible suffer and die solely for my own gastric pleasure. One of my favorite vegan inspirations is holocaust survivor Alex Hershaft, he did [a Reddit AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2h8df0/i_am_an_80yearold_holocaust_survivor_who/) a while ago which might interest you."

I'm not an expert on the protein part, but Americans consume way to much protein as is. And if there are no other viable methods to provide nutrition, vegans have no issue with eating meat. &gt;Further more, I think vegans are fairly naive when it comes to not using animal products. For instance a friend of mine that works for PETA recently posted a picture of what she called """"bee free honey"""" which she said was made out of Apple's mostly. She didn't realize that Apple orchards bring in be hives to pollinate their trees. Yes, apples need polination. No vegan has an issue with this. The bees do it naturally, and don't need the resulting plants. They gain from it, and so do we. Taking the honey from the bees, however, creates some ethical issues. &gt;Additionally I've seen and heard many vegans eating and taking about eating organic produce which in case you didn't know always uses manure which is an animal by product. Vegan =/= Organic. And the definition of vegan is to use as few animal products as practically possible. It's almost impossible to completely remove animal products from one's life."

This decision comes as a result of careful consideration of the conditions that constitute the life of a livestock animal, whereas I believe that I was not vegan for as long as I was because of ignorance: a disconnect between the food on my plate and the living, sentient being that suffered and--in the case of meat--died to get there. &gt;In my opinion to tell a person of the third world, a socio-economically disadvantaged American or a native that eating meat is wrong, is both arrogant and insensitive. It is really easy to be on your high horse about diet when it is not a struggle for you to find a meal. Not all vegans believe that it is their mission to tell others to be vegan. I am a vegan for ethical reasons, but I consider that my personal choice. I recognize that having the time and energy to consider matters of animal ethics--especially given that I made the switch from vegetarian to vegan as a result of readings and discussions I had in a food ethics class in college--comes from a place of privilege. I recognize that for the person who is struggling to survive, these kinds of considerations are unlikely to be at the top of their priority list. Yet I'm not going to not live according to my values just because privileged played a role in their development, particularly when my values are about not supporting harm toward sentient beings. &gt;Further more many this third world countries can easily grow livestock where they may struggle to produce soy or other vegetable based proteins. Most cattle in the U.S. are not grass fed for the majority of their lives; cattle tend to be fed corn and soy. As a matter of fact, the land used to grow all of that corn and soy could be used to grow enough food to feed every food insecure person in America. &gt;Additionally I've seen and heard many vegans eating and taking about eating organic produce which in case you didn't know always uses manure which is an animal by product. Veganism and organics, or any other number of things (gluten-free, raw, etc.) are not the same. There's a correlation--there are vegans who do not want to support pesticide use for a number of reasons, for example, but it would be an error to assume that all vegans live according to certain practices other than being vegan itself. &gt;I could get into the evolutionary argument about how humans have evolved to eat meat so it can't be immoral to follow your genetic coding War has been practiced among humans for thousands of years and there are primates who go to war with each other.

There are plenty of natural things that are good, but being natural in and of itself does not make something right. ~ I'd encourage you to watch a documentary such as Earthlings ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibuQ-J04eLQ ) to learn more about the kinds of conditions livestock animals experience.

It says: &gt;Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, *as far as possible and practicable*, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose. So, there's no reason to think that vegans have any objection to people who have no other options using animals to survive. (2) The other reasons you give for your view are red herrings.

The third claim simply points out a purported fact about our digestive system. Again, so what? The evolved structure of our digestive system just has no bearing on what, morally, we ought to do. So, because your view is partly based on a false premise, and is 'supported' by irrelevant claims, you should change it.

It is really easy to be on your high horse about diet when it is not a struggle for you to find a meal. Imagine instead of animals, some socio-economically disadvantaged person was eating baby meat. It wouldn't much matter if they would go hungry for lack of baby meat, you would still probably say that they shouldn't eat the baby meat since babies are sentient creatures with a right to not suffer, so on and so forth, and nobody could call you insensitive for pointing this out. Same with vegans with regard to animals. &gt;Further more many this third world countries can easily grow livestock where they may struggle to produce soy or other vegetable based proteins. Argentina for example has a near limitless supply of grass for which they can use to grow beef with.

While true, Argentina is not a third world country.

CMV: Veganism in America is a privileged white value and as such should be considered ignorant.,justin_timeforcake,0,"Since most of your view talks about why vegans shouldn't tell people from underprivileged areas to be vegan, let me address that first. Most vegans actually would agree with you (and might also point out that the diet of people in the developing world usually consists of very little animal products anyway.) But as someone who lives as a vegan in the developed world, surely I can point out that other people who come from the same place, culture, and socio-economic group as myself are just as able to go vegan as I am. As for the """"limitless supply of grazing grass"""" in places like Argentina, you need to look a little further into the situation. [This article](http://grist.org/sustainable-food/in-argentina-factory-farms-replacing-grass-fed-beef/) talks about how Argentina is switching over to factory farming for animals, and using their grasslands for growing crops like soy and corn which become livestock feed, mostly for export. Of course factory farms are a horror show, and use huge amounts of resources at great cost to the environment, [but grass-fed animal agriculture may even be worse](http://www.thecuttingedgenews.com/index.php?article=85633). It takes longer to grow the animals, so more resources are used and more greenhouse gases are created due to the methane produced. A great documentary that explores the environmental cost of animal agriculture is 'Cowspiracy'. Silly title aside, it's really an eye-opening film, I highly recommend watching it. As for vegans being naive about not using animal products, your view here is extremely ungenerous. I would counter that most vegans *are* aware that crops are pollinated by bees. But since we have to eat something, there isn't really an alternative that allows people to remain healthy and get all the nutrients we need. Veganism isn't about """"zero-impact"""", because to be truly zero-impact, the only thing one can do is kill oneself. Veganism is about choosing the option that creates the least amount of harm. It's easy to shop for your groceries and choose only food that doesn't contain animal products. But when was the last time you say a food label that gave information on whether or not the soil used to grow the food contained animal manure? Expecting people to find that kind of information about every single food they eat is a ridiculous expectation. As for your evolutionary 'argument', we require certain nutrients to thrive and be healthy. Our bodies don't care if those nutrients come from animal sources or plant sources."

What if you have a deadly disease and need non-vegan medication to survive? Only an idiot would tell that person not to take it! The point of veganism is reducing suffering where you can. To be perfectly honest, by simply existing we're probably fucking things over for animals (including humans). It's almost impossible to live a truly cruelty free life, and the only way to do that would be to probably end your own life. But veganism isn't about avoiding cruelty to the point where you can't even live anymore. It's about reducing as much cruelty *as you can.* It's about not promoting cruelty for the sake of your own pleasure. I know everyone's focusing on the food aspect of it, but that's only a part of what veganism focuses on. If someone decided not to buy a fur coat because they were morally opposed to it, would that be considered """"privileged,"""" even though a cotton jacket would cost less? Being conscious of the world around you doesn't have to be a privileged. Having morals and trying your best to stick to them isn't privileged. I'm never going to chastise someone if they genuinely need to do something """"unethical"""" (although I'd never chastise someone in the first place). I just don't consider liking the taste of meat a genuine need. I'm aware that the drugs I've had to take have been tested on animals. I know how awful palm oil is (and have been trying to reduce it). I know there are just realities of life I can't avoid. I also know me single handedly being vegan doesn't really make an effect on anything. However, I'm just suppose to not try then? That's ridiculous. That's like being against child labor, but still buying Nikes, because what would it matter anyways? If someone was morally opposed to that and tried to speak out against those practices, and then turned around and still bought products made by children, would you not consider that hypocritical? It's the same thing for being vegan. Yes, I'll never be 100% truly vegan, nor will no one ever be, but I have moral and ethical standards and I'm going to stick to them the best I can. I know everyone is different. If you're a college student and you haven't eaten in a week and somebody offers you a hamburger, I wouldn't blame you for eating it. At the same time though, if you can go grocery shopping and have 10 minutes a day to dedicate to food and don't have any health conditions forcing you to eat meat or dairy (which most people don't), then don't act like you """"can't"""" go vegan. You don't want to. That's your choice to make, but it's a choice. Also, it's pretty racist to say that this is just a white thing. I've met plenty of people who are black, latino, or asian who are vegan or vegetarian. A lot of the reason why so many vegans are white is because people view this as some privilege thing for white people. Guess what, get a big bag of fucking rice, some black beans, and mixed veggies. Seriously that's what I live off of for days at a time, and that's just because I think it's delicious, it's easy to make, and cheap. If you buy specialty vegan products it'll be more expensive, but if you keep things simple then it can often times be cheaper. If you keep telling people this is some special white person thing, then it's going to be treated as such. It's not. Everyone has morals. It's not just white people can follow them. Not buying leather or fur, avoiding products that have been tested on animals (you can still buy them at CVS, they have bunnies on the back to indicate they're """"cruelty free""""), or even just choosing to eat a banana and peanut butter for a snack instead of like... cheese sticks or something (idk) are really simple things that almost anyone can do. Your skin color doesn't matter and neither does your poverty level as much. I'm not ignorant for having morals and sticking to them. Yes, I'm sure there are vegans (just like anyone) who are oblivious and don't realize the impact they have just by existing, but don't generalize that into a whole group of people. I chose to become vegan because I wanted to stop being ignorant to the cruelties of the world. I'm not perfect, but why is it a bad thing that I'm trying?"

I don't understand how veganism being white/privileged makes it ignorant. 2. I'm a vegan and most vegans I know don't have a problem with natives or people in food deserts. However, there is a belief that veganism is more expensive than meat diets, which is not true. Veganism is actually a lot cheaper. Look at it this way: which is more expensive, beef and cheese or beans and rice? Which is vegan? Other people have done analysis, and contrary to popular belief, vegan diets actually tend to be cheaper as long as you aren't simply replacing meat with tofurky and are instead branching out into whole plant-based foods like lentils. Besides that, I have met much fewer judgemental vegans than empathetic vegans in real life. All of us are converts; none of us were born vegans, and most of us understand why people eat meat. I realize that going vegan is quite difficult, especially for someone like me who has a tight budget and few kitchen supplies, and don't judge people who think the difficulty outweighs the possible moral failings. 3. Your friend probably does realize that things like manure and pollination involve animals. Very few vegans are so into purity that they want totally vegan farming. The objective is to reduce animal suffering as much as possible, and at this stage it is impossible or impractical to be completely, purely vegan. I don't worry about very small uses of animal products, like using fish guts in sugar bleaching, because that isn't really going to help animals much. If more people become vegan, it will be less and less economical to use animal products when another product can be used. 4. I don't understand what you mean by free range cattle being more economical than vegetables. As far as land goes, it is much more economical to grow soy than raise cattle for slaughter because it cuts out the """"middle man"""" so to say. It takes 13 lbs of grain to produce 1 lb of meat. It's also more environmentally friendly. It takes more than 11 times as much fossil fuel to make one calorie from animal protein as it does to make one calorie from plant protein. I'm really curious as to why you believe that free range cattle grazing is more economically efficient than growing vegetables."

CMV: Veganism in America is a privileged white value and as such should be considered ignorant.,lnfinity,0,"&gt;First off. It is a largely white privileged ideal. I understand that there cultures that are vegan that are not white such as jains in India. This however is religious fundamentalism which is a whole different rational for being vegan. You'd be hard-pressed to find something that is uniformly represented among every demographic. &gt;In my opinion to tell a person of the third world, a socio-economically disadvantaged American or a native that eating meat is wrong, is both arrogant and insensitive. It is really easy to be on your high horse about diet when it is not a struggle for you to find a meal. There are plenty of important ethical issues that are more difficult to follow when you are impoverished. I'm sure not stealing or purchasing energy efficient light bulbs is also harder for members of those groups. I still tell people that they shouldn't steal and should buy energy efficient lights as much as possible and practicable. That said, nobody is going out and targeting veganism specifically at under privileged groups. The vast majority of promoting veganism is targeted at people like yourself who could adopt a vegan lifestyle with very little difficulty. &gt;Further more many this third world countries can easily grow livestock where they may struggle to produce soy or other vegetable based proteins. Argentina for example has a near limitless supply of grass for which they can use to grow beef with. Free range grass fed grazing cattle is actually more economically efficient than most vegetable proteins (something which vegans are often wrong about). Once again, nobody is targeting the third world, but hunger in poor parts of the world is not caused by a lack of arable land. Ethiopia continued to export grain to feed livestock in richer countries even at the height of its famine due to the fact that people could get higher prices by growing grain to sell elsewhere than they could get by growing food to sell domestically. &gt;Further more, I think vegans are fairly naive when it comes to not using animal products. For instance a friend of mine that works for PETA recently posted a picture of what she called """"bee free honey"""" which she said was made out of Apple's mostly. She didn't realize that Apple orchards bring in be hives to pollinate their trees. There are very real difference in treatment of bees for honey versus pollination, there are huge differences in the quantity of product obtained to the number of bees used, and there is a huge difference in the ease of which the use of bees can be avoided by not buying honey versus not eating pollinated foods. Perhaps one of these reasons are why someone would avoid honey but not apples, or perhaps there was one vegan once who did something that did not make perfect logical sense. That is hardly evidence that vegans in general should be considered naive, and the fact that you feel the need to bring it up as evidence speaks much more to your own prejudices. &gt;Additionally I've seen and heard many vegans eating and taking about eating organic produce which in case you didn't know always uses manure which is an animal by product. Once again, maybe there are other factors involved that you are missing or perhaps not everything that every vegan has ever done is perfectly logical."

It is really easy to be on your high horse about diet when it is not a struggle for you to find a meal.

Widespread adoption of vegetarian diets would actually make feeding the world quite a bit easier. &gt;Free range grass fed grazing cattle is actually more economically efficient than most vegetable proteins (something which vegans are often wrong about).

CMV: Veganism in America is a privileged white value and as such should be considered ignorant.,DirtySketel,0,"Veganism is not ignorant, it is rational, and has been strong arguments in its favour. The two key aspects are the ethical arguments (which are primary to veganism), and the environmental aspects (which are very strong, but are secondary to the ethical aspect). My decision to go vegan, and many others I have spoken with, was not based on emotional feels for the animals, but on looking into the arguments on both sides. Is it rational to cause suffering to conscious beings when there is a viable alternative? We kill on the scale of tens of billions of such things every year just to satisfy our personal appetites. However, no amount of personal appetite makes for an ethical justifcation. The arguments against veganism are almost uniformly terrible. """"It's natural"""" is a common one, but there are many things that are natural that are bad, and many times when the superior ethical decision is to go against our nature. We haven't been living """"naturally"""" for a long time, and thanks to the wonders of modern technology we now have a viable alternative to animal abuse in almost every situation. Another common one is """"Other animals do it"""", but we do not and never have used the behaviour of other animals as a guide for our own moral behaviour. Can you imagine trying to justify infanticide on the grounds that lions use it as a means to eradicate the offspring of rivals? Another is """"Animals do not make moral choices therefore they are not worthy of moral consideration"""", but there are many humans who we agree are worthy of moral consideration despite having limited moral capacity themselves, such as infants or the mentally handicapped. """"If we stopped eating them, they'd go extinct/take over the world"""". Well for starters, they won't take over the world, because the world isn't going vegan overnight, we'd just gradually reduce breeding as more people made the switch, not one day release tens of billions animals into the wild. As far extinction is concerned, we usually worry about extinction because it's a good indicator that we're fucking up ecosystems, and this tends to also knock on and further affect ecosystems. Farm animals are not parts of an ecosystem in the natural sense. In fact, animal agriculture fucks up loads of ecosystems and threatens extinction on other species. Ask yourself, is it better to be an extinct species or one kept in perpetual holocaust with no hope of salvation? Anyway, if we stopped keeping farm animals we could still keep a few in sanctuaries to preserve the species if we wanted. These are just some of the arguments commonly raised in defense of meat eating, but they are clearly bad arguments. The real reason people eat meat, and I used to eat meat, is """"I like it, and no one can stop me"""". The environmental arguments for veganism are widely known at this point. Animal agriculture is one of the most environmentally destructive forces on the planet, and every environmental group recommends dramatically reducing meat and animal product consumption. Going vegan is the single best lifestyle change one individual can make for the environment. So the question is, do you have a rational argument for unnecessarily harming and killing animals, and damaging the environment?"

CMV: Veganism in America is a privileged white value and as such should be considered ignorant.,Kurama1,0,"First, do you have any sources to back your claims that meat is a more efficient produce? I'm a vegetarian. My belief is that I can get by and survive without consuming meat that came from a tortured animal just fine. So why shouldn't I? If veganism was more practical in my current lifestyle, I'd be on board with that too. Sure, our ancestors have been eating meat for millennia. But now we have evolved into a species that can farm and harvest countless amount of non animal products. The fact that we continue to harvest animals for their meat simply because it tastes good seems utterly selfish to me. Yes, meat provides good nutritional value. But Americans consume a ridiculous amount of protein everyday that they don't need. It isn't hard to replace your protein with various protein rich vegetables or beans. Taking meat out if you diet also lowers your cholesterol and saturated fats intake. A noteworthy benefit. I think it's unfair to classify all vegans as those who do just to feel like they're better than everyone else. Most might act that way, but they really do for the health benefits and ethical reasons. Some people just aren't good at being humble. edit: As far as your concern about race, I think that's a bit irrelevant. Sure, most vegans are white. But most criminals in the u.s. are black.

Yes, there's some privilege to being able to afford morality, but that is the same in every aspect of life. If you're out in the wild surviving as you must, very few people will judge you for what you had to do to keep alive. However, when people debate the virtues of veganism and vegetarianism in society, we're already setting a precedent that you're a person in a first world country who can afford food. And after that, I don't know what you're on about it being arrogant to someone socio-economically disabled. Best example I've got; went out to dinner the past few weeks with friends at Chipotle. They're ordering full burritos and tacos and such, I'm just getting some rice and cheese, maybe a quesadilla with just cheese. Their meals are ~$10-15, mine is less than $2 because just getting some rice and cheese is counted as sides instead of a meal. You can find very cheap vegetarian offerings, especially at restaurants, because often that salad or that sandwich without all the meat and dressings is just considered the cheap left overs on the side. A full sub at Publix is usually about $5.50, I get mine for $1.96 because I just want a loaf of bread and some provolone. If anything it would be easier to encourage the socio-economically disadvantaged to give up the luxury of meats. I encourage you to look at the prices of the offerings in your area, I think you'll be surprised about how much more affordable it is."
CMV: Veganism in America is a privileged white value and as such should be considered ignorant.,karp505,0,"Hmm, I totally disagree that it's a white privileged ideal. From personal experience, I traveled in the U.S. for nine months straight, with a budget of ~$150 per month for food. I had no trouble maintaining a healthy, vegan diet on that budget. In fact, one of the things that consistently surprises me about the vegetarian/vegan community is the broad diversity it exhibits in race, socio-economic status, age, gender (although there is a slight skew towards women) and religion. I remember the first time I went to a vegetarian food festival: I assumed it would be only white people, but I was very wrong. That being said, even though it's totally viable, I've never heard anyone tell someone with very little means that they are doing wrong by eating meat. Usually, the argument goes that if you are living in a first world country, and have the means to be vegan, you should seriously question why you aren't. And I'm sorry, but explain again how using cow manure harms the cow? Also, the argument from evolution is a terrible one. We also evolved in a way that predisposes many of us to hurt and kill other people. How moral is that? With all due respect, it seems like you either haven't had many thoughtful discussions with vegans, have been talking to ideological sheep (yes, just like any lifestyle, not everyone who follows it has thought out the logic of it/can defend it very well), or are not sincerely open to trying to understand their viewpoint (many people have already offered viable rebuttals to your claims, yet you don't seem to even consider any of them). Maybe all three. I can understand disagreeing with veganism, or not wanting to adopt it as a lifestyle, but I don't understand how it's ignorant. In fact, I think it's very much the opposite. At the heart of veganism is the thought that you go out of your way to understand where your food comes from. In fact, many of the discussions I have with omnivores on the subject results in them saying something along the lines of """"I'd rather not know"""". That's pretty much the definition of willful ignorance."
CMV: Veganism in America is a privileged white value and as such should be considered ignorant.,hedning,0,"&gt; It is a largely white privileged ideal. How does the potential fact that more affluent white people are vegans affect the morality of killing animals for palate pleasure? Inflicting suffering or death upon animals requires justification. Entertainment, pleasure or convenience can't constitute such a justification as far as I'm concerned. &gt; should be considered ignorant Vegans are almost by definition more educated about the food system than non-vegans, as almost all vegans become so through educating themselves. Hardly what I'd called ignorant. &gt; In my opinion to tell a person of the third world, a socio-economically disadvantaged American or a native that eating meat is wrong, is both arrogant and insensitive. Good thing no vegan are doing that. It's important to look at context when understanding morality. Killing animals for food when it's necessary for survival is not comparable to killing animals for palate pleasure. It doesn't require much willingness on part of the listener to discern when one is talking about which case. I find it quite arrogant to use poor people as an argument for the continuation of the immensely wasteful meat production undertaken at unprecedented levels in the affluent part of the world. Most poor people eat very little meat, merely because it's more expensive. &gt; Free range grass fed grazing cattle is actually more economically efficient than most vegetable proteins (something which vegans are often wrong about). Independently of that being true or not. Pasture raised beef is not a reliable way to feed the world. [60% of all farmland](http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/solutions/stop-deforestation/solutions-for-deforestation-free-meat.html) (arable + pasture) is used to produce beef. It provides us with 2% of our calories (5% of protein). This includes grain feed beef. It's quite difficult making a resource of an animal that requires [36 calories in feed to produce 1 calorie in food](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/33/11996.figures-only). &gt; Further more, I think vegans are fairly naive when it comes to not using animal products. Most vegans are very aware that being 100% vegan is basically impossible in our current society. They're also aware that this doesn't stop them from eliminating 90%+ of the animal products which are extremely easy to replace. Perfect shouldn't be the enemy of good. &gt; Additionally I've seen and heard many vegans eating and taking about eating organic produce which in case you didn't know always uses manure which is an animal by product. While it's true that organic farming most often use manure, it isn't always the case. Veganic farming is a thing. Personally I find it a bit silly to put chemical fertilizer in the same boat as pesticides. Eating organic have inherently nothing to do with being vegan. Just to add to that. It's often thought that manure is a net positive resource. [This isn't the case](http://www.inexactchange.org/blog/2013/03/28/unlikely-fix/).

This however is religious fundamentalism which is a whole different rational for being vegan They don't count because they're religious? What a strange argument. Jain veganism originates from the central humanist philosphy/tenant of *Ahimsa*, which posits one should not commit violence or injury to others if it can be avoided. This is pretty much the exact same justifcation used for western veganism. It is not an arbirary law dictated by a god nor is it """"fundamentalism""""--jainism denies the existence of a god/creator, and is an atheist/nonthiestic religion &gt;Argentina for example has a near limitless supply of grass for which they can use to grow beef with.

Accoding to this article, agricultural markets in Argentina have boomed recently, and soy/wheat/corn production has overtaken beef, as cattle proves to be increasingly unprofitable. It also wildly environmentally unsustainable. Next to fossil fuels, animal agriculture is the biggest contributor to green house gases and methane emissions. &gt;Further more, I think vegans are fairly naive when it comes to not using animal products. For instance a friend of mine that works for PETA recently posted a picture of what she called """"bee free honey"""" which she said was made out of Apple's mostly. She didn't realize that Apple orchards bring in be hives to pollinate their trees. This individual anecdote is not a meaningful argument. I think most omnivores are fairly naive when it comes to understanding where their food comes from and the intelligence of the animals they are consuming. According to this [study](http://psp.sagepub.com/content/38/2/247.short), people tend to ascribe lower levels of mental functioning to animals that they are about to eat. This is why the notion of eating a domestic house cat is mortifying, but a eating pig is not, even though pigs are considerably smarter. &gt;Additionally I've seen and heard many vegans eating and taking about eating organic produce which in case you didn't know always uses manure which is an animal by product. I, and most other vegans I know, do not eat organic food for this very reason. It's not very hard considering 90% of food in supermarkets is non-organic &gt;I could get into the evolutionary argument about how humans have evolved to eat meat so it can't be immoral to follow your genetic coding I always found that to be a very weak argument. The question should be about what humans **should** eat. Just because we can doesn't mean we should. Some of our ancestors may have needed meat, but in a modern 1st world country, if I can survive perfectly happily without causing pain and suffering to other living things (or at least minimizing it as much as reasonably possible), then why shouldn't I? You haven;t given a convincing justication as to why evolutionary past should have any bearing on contemporary ethics/morals. It's not like our ancestors anticipated anything as un-natural seeming, brutal, and industrialized as modern factory farming practices."
CMV: Veganism in America is a privileged white value and as such should be considered ignorant.,buttosaurus-rex,0,"Much of your argument, as others have mentioned, stems from the completely unfounded belief that all vegans are obnoxious and preachy. While some are, they would be obnoxious and preachy regardless of their dietary choices. Secondly, to suggest that someone's choices are ignorant because they come from a position of privilege is pretty closed-minded. By that same logic people should not choose to attend university, or live in a house or nice apartment, since both these choices are only possible with a certain degree of privilege. I would like you to explain further why many vegans being white invalidates the movement. I do not quite understand your thought process here. In your third paragraph, you mention native peoples. I imagine your spin here is that many North American native cultures' cuisines feature meat prominently, and, to suggest that such a diet is not the most ethical, is culturally insensitive. While this may be true, it is also true that those cuisines developed when the world's population was smaller and the environment much more able to support such a diet. To take an example: some tribes, in the past, hunted caribou. Nowadays, the caribou population in many areas is teetering on the brink of extinction. To continue these hunts regardless would be a highly irresponsible thing to do. My point with this example is this: I do concede that preserving different cultures and traditions is important, but it is even more important that these cultures and traditions can adapt to our modern, changing world in such a way that they maintain their uniqueness, but do not cause problems for future generations. Your fourth paragraph is one I take a fair amount of issue with. It may be true that grass-fed cattle is not as harmful to the environment as factory cattle, this is not where the majority of Americans get their beef. Most get it from factory farms, which are more harmful to the environment than all the cars in the world. I must say, it's a little hypocritical then to rail against vegans for being privileged and then turn around and suggest that people should only buy grass-fed beef, as if a person could more readily afford a grass-fed steak than a can of beans or jar of peanut butter. In your final few paragraphs, you raise the point that even vegans benefit from the use of animals. First let me address your statement about bees. Yes, farmers do use bee to pollinate their fruits, but this what bees do regardless of whether humans make them do it or not. One could even argue that the bees benefit from this arrangement, since they are sent out into a field full of flowers to feast on, only to return to a safe, protected hive. I doubt many vegans would take issue with that. It seems, to me, almost like a symbiotic relationship. As for manure, well, again, pooping is a natural thing for animals to do, and it hurts them in no way to take their waste away from them, and is, in fact, more environmentally friendly, which many vegans support. More than that, however, most vegans know that they are not perfect. They know that they have, at some point, accidentally eaten an animal product, but, if you have to do everything perfectly, you can't really do anything."

CMV: Veganism in America is a privileged white value and as such should be considered ignorant.,Dragons_Malk,0,"Veganism exists mainly for the sake of the animals. For ethical vegans, it is our philosophy that since using animal-based products isn't necessary to our survival, it can be done away with in our lives. Yes, I am aware that it comes as a privilege. But it still ties into the core belief *because* I can avoid animal products. Those who are underprivileged can't afford to do so because if they did, they would die. As an American, (but not white so settle down), I have the ability to cut out animal products of my life for good, (or for the time being at least; I don't know what the future holds). But there will always be things I, or any other vegan for that matter, can't avoid. Vaccines, trampling on tiny organisms in my every day walking, using foods farmed with manure, foods pollinated by bees, and other stupid arguments you might make are okay because those things simply cannot be avoided unless I want to be malnourished and sickly. Are you so incredibly selfish that you can't sympathize with an animal's feelings? Free range or not, animals are dying every day. And for what? So little, ol' you doesn't feel judged for your actions? That's pathetic. You shouldn't write off a movement simply because your feelings are hurt. So what if you feel judged upon for consuming meat?

Vegetarians """"in it for the animals"""" harbor no notion that they are preventing any and all animals from coming to unnatural deaths due to their action. They are practicing """"harm reduction"""", and doing so successfully. You would be hard pressed to demonstrate that the total (in terms of biomass or raw individuals) number of animals killed by non-meat agricultural practices comes within an order of magnitude of the total killed for meat. Let's do some math which will demonstrate that your argument is significantly off. Beef cattle are amongst (if not the) largest supply of calories per animal life. (Unless we start whaling again.) [A 1200 pound steer produces about 750 pounds of meat and about 150 pounds of consumed fat.](http://igrow.org/livestock/beef/how-much-meat-can-you-expect-from-a-fed-steer/) [75 grams of pure raw muscle tissue produces about 23g of protein (rest is water and insignificant amounts of carbs).](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef) That's a yield of less than 33%, but let's call it 33% to make the math easier. So a cow gives us 250 pounds of protein, 150 pounds of fat. 454g per pound = 113,500g protein, 68,100g fat 4kcal per g protein = 454,000 kcal protein, 10kcal per g fat = 681,000 kcal fat. 1,135,000 calories per life (never minding the lives killed by the farm machinery collecting feed for the cow) [Corn produces 12 million calories per acre](http://www.waldeneffect.org/blog/Calories_per_acre_for_various_foods/). 1/12th of an acre is 60'x60' So unless you're charging that farm machinery kills one animal every single 60x60' area they cover..."

From the philosophical side, compare this to ANY ethical stance. Consider a congressman who is openly (and obviously) against genocidal wars in the middle east. Some of his gas money undoubtedly eventually goes to funding those wars: does this make his peace-votes hypocritical? Or a lawyer who adamantly tries to protect all his client's civil rights.

They probably apply flea killing chemicals on their dog and avoid honey because it exploits bees. They might fumigate a house against mice but avoid makeup that tests on hamsters. This is hypocritical only if they claim moral superiority, but even then they are more removed from the animal harming process than us, so me claiming ot be an animal and environment lover to eat meat is even more hypocritical.

They believe in harm *minimization*. Like meat-eaters, vegetarians are not ready to give up all creature comforts in the name of ethics. However, they are willing to forego at least some of them. We all know that yes, farming is going to kill animals. But the production of cattle, pigs, and chickens is several factors more expensive. Not only are the livestock slaughtered, but they also must be fed, meaning more crops have to be grown, and thus even more mice and gophers destroyed. Moreover, from a carbon emissions standpoint, vegetarians clearly have the moral-high ground. Raising livestock is known to be one of the largest emitters of CO2, and it has been suggested by many that minimization of meat production would be key measure in reducing greenhouse emissions. Thus, using the harm-minimization principle, I believe vegetarians are morally consistent."

I understand it to mean: """"The beliefs or morals espoused by vegetarians are inconsistent with their actions"""" or """"The philosophical position of 'Meat is Murder' is inconsistent with a consuming fruit and vegetables produced using modern agriculture techniques"""" This is a logical fallacy: [tu quoque] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque) The actions of an individual does not affect the morality of a situation or a persons. So the fact that someone believes that killing animals is wrong is not diminished by the fact that some of their actions may result in the deaths of animals. &gt;it's philosophically inconsistent to be sternly against killing animals for meat products, when animals are also killed for fruit and vegetable products This is oversimplifying the position of the vegetarian. The statement 'killing animals is wrong' is shorthand for a more complex, qualified and nuanced belief. Much like it is common for people to say 'killing is wrong' but for many of them to support euthanasia, abortion or murder in self defense. The same can be said of vegetarians. So for example I may feel eating meat is not ok but the death of animals as a byproduct of farming is ok because I believe cows, pigs, chickens, sheep have a higher level of consciousness than gophers and rats and their lives should be given preference. I know you said that you didn't want pragmatic reasons but I'm going to give one anyway. I don't believe level at which you judge consistency between your actions and your beliefs is reasonable.

After some research you discover WatchCorp are responsible for the death of over 100 workers in their Bangladeshi factory due to cost cuttings and deliberate attempts to dodge health and safety regulations. You keep the watch is this compatible with your belief? 4. You still aren't sure if you should keep the watch so decide to drive to your friends house to ask for some advice. The car you drive is cheap because they exploit their workers leading to regular suicides, the petrol is cheap because your country supports autocratic despots that oppress and murder their people.

For one, I think you might me misinterpreting the concept of utility as literal utility, rather than happiness, or, prevention of suffering, or what have you, which is the more traditional view. That of doing the most good for the most people in the most expedient/efficient manner. Ignoring the potential utility of a non-being is anything but arbitrary. It is a non-being. It *could* be a being, but it isn't. Because it isn't a being, and, arguably, not alive, it really is not important to consider what it could (if it even could) want. Furthermore, it is ludicrous to take the hypothetical things that a hypothetical being hypothetically would want, and then give them preciseness over actual things that an actual person actually wants. One of the problems with this potential argument (as with all abortion rhetoric) is a matter of drawing the line. Everything down to a sperm and egg have the potential to be a human, so I guess we can't use birth control, because we'd be squandering the future utility of the egg. I'm also a little unsure on your animal rights argument, specifically, what are you arguing. I think there is a blurring of three questions pertaining to eating meat. 1. Is eating meat ethical? 2. Is raising animals to eat for meat ethical? 3. Are current animal raising practices in America ethical?

If she's a brilliant biochemist at a top graduate school and having a child would derail all her scientific plans, there's a bit more good to be gained in the world by aborting the child than if she's currently stocking shelves for a living and has no hobbies or goals. Of course, in the latter case having a child will probably suck more for her personally, but the kid's joy in life might eventually make up for it. However, no system on earth is going to take someone's possible future contribution to humanity into account before determining whether something is murder or an ethnically harmless medical procedure and a lot of people reading this are probably already angry at me just for implying that there are circumstances in which one human life might be considered more valuable than another. Of course, your way of looking at it is also flawed because a possible life is not a life. If we considered the potential joy in a possible life to be worth some amount of suffering in an existing life then it would be totally ethically permissible to rape fertile women because you're causing lives that wouldn't have otherwise existed.

CMV: It is illogical for vegans to completely abstain from the consumption of animal products,nkfarwell,0,"get ready for an essay The idea that slaughtering and consuming animals needlessly is wrong hinges on the idea that animals have rights. This type of thinking and concern for the wellbeing of animals is found in many eastern religions and philosophies, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, but isn’t found much in the west. Historically in European culture, animals have been thought of as no more than property. The case for animal rights is to challenge this assumption that animals are just means to human ends, but are instead sentient beings which should have their interests considered, and furthermore that the distinction between humans and non-human animals is arbitrary. If we assert that they have intrinsic value and inalienable rights similar to those we grant to humans, then it quickly follows that their murder for the purposes of taste pleasure or other luxuries is unjustified. But can we make that assertion, that all animals deserve rights, human or not? First we need to take a step back and look at the popular justifications for human rights. In western culture, it is generally thought that all people have equal rights, despite their sex, race, or other genetic factors. A challenge to this is that all humans are in fact not equal, since people have different intellectual capabilities, physical ability, creativity, empathy, or any other quality. It could be said that some humans are simply inferior by genetic disposition, and therefore should not receive the same rights as their conspecifics. If one was to justify equal rights for humans by virtue of human equality, it would be flawed, as all humans are not equal. As a result, we don’t use any metrics like these to decide what rights people have. Equality isn’t a statement that all people are equal, it’s a statement that all people deserve to be treated equally, despite any inequalities. For example, it would be villainous to give someone with Down Syndrome less rights than a healthy individual in order to exploit them to our ends, for rights are not given on the basis of intelligence, ability, or any other measurable quality. To zoom out and apply this to non-human animals, if having greater intelligence or ability isn’t justification to give one human more rights than another, how can it be used to allow humans to take advantage of other species? Some philosophers have put forward the principle of equal consideration of interests, which is essentially the idea that one should consider the interests of all affected parties to determine whether an action is right or wrong. Equal consideration is used to argue against racism, sexism, and all other manners of discrimination, but Jeremy Bentham was one of the first to realize this applied not only to humans, but to other animals as well. To quote him: “...the question is not, Can they reason? nor Can they talk, but Can they suffer?” (Bentham, 144). Here, Bentham argues that the ability to suffer is what gives a being the right to equal consideration. This capacity is requisite to talk about the interests and rights of beings. For example, to say that it is against the interests of a tree to be cut down is false, for that tree does not have the capacity for suffering or enjoyment. To say that it is against the interests of a pig to be raised in poor conditions and killed for food, however, is completely legitimate, as that pig has a clear desire to live and aversion to suffering. To use any other metric is arbitrary; if intelligence, conquest, or simple species membership is the measure by which we decide rights, why not use sex or skin colour instead? One could argue for self-awareness or cognizance as the quality that sets humans apart from other animals, but I argue that this, too, is not relevant. A sense of self and abstract concept of death surely makes one’s interest in life more valuable, but it does not justify a discounting of a lesser desire to live. Therefore, the only logical position is one that grants the right of equal consideration of interests to nonhuman animals. But how far does this idea of animal equality go? Should they be allowed to vote, purchase property, or go to our public schools? Clearly not, so it needs to be reiterated that animals are given equal consideration of interests, not equal individual rights. For example, if I have a dog who I am trying to housebreak and they defecate in the house, I may use a spray bottle or mild punishment to convey to the dog that they had done unacceptable behaviour in order to train them. The interests of having a clean and safe home outweigh whatever suffering may be inflicted by giving the dog mild punishment, so with equal consideration of interests, it is fine to do that. However, if I were to mercilessly beat the dog in response to their mistake, the pain inflicted by this would far outweigh any benefit for either party, which would make it wrong in the context of equal consideration. In the same way, if I were to ground or otherwise punish a child for breaking something in the house, my interest to teach the child and have a clean home outweigh their suffering from punishment; but if I were to hit the child to cause pain or give unreasonable punishment, that would be unacceptable. This is what is meant by saying animals deserve equal rights to consideration. All of these concepts are generally agreed upon, though. Many people believe suffering is wrong, whether in animals or humans. The argument that it is wrong to kill animals for human ends isn’t dependent on that idea, but the assertion that animals do have rights is foundational to it. A being’s intelligence, thoughtfulness, or other qualities aren’t relevant to pain and suffering, as they are in equal consideration for all beings assuming equal pain. Qualities beyond the capacity for suffering are, however, relevant to the value of a life. The life of a being with higher intelligence, ability to empathize, and concept of the future is more valuable than the life of a being without these things. In the context of humans, if one was forced to take the life of a severely mentally disabled individual or a healthy one, it would not be wrong to save the the healthy one. Despite both being human, the healthy person has greater intellectual capacity, vision of the future, and value to the race. In the same way, if forced to choose between the life of an animal and the life of a healthy human, it would not be wrong to choose the human. While the life of an animal is less than that of a human, their slaughter for the purpose of satisfying our taste buds is absolutely unjustifiable. “There can be no defence of eating flesh in terms of satisfying nutritional needs, since it has been established beyond doubt that we could satisfy our need for protein and other essential nutrients far more efficiently with a diet that replaced animal flesh by high-protein vegetable products” (Singer, 1985). It is absolutely vital that this concept is understood, humans are perfectly capable of not only surviving, but thriving on a plant-based diet. You shouldn’t take Singer’s word for it, though, look at the data. A study done by the American Diabetes Association took a group of randomly selected persons with type 2 diabetes and subjected half of them to a diet following the ADA guidelines, while putting the others on a low-fat vegan diet. It demonstrated that “Both a low-fat vegan diet and a diet based on ADA guidelines improved glycemic and lipid control in type 2 diabetic patients. These improvements were greater with a low-fat vegan diet” (Barnard, 2006). Considering there is little evidence challenging these results, it seems to be clear that there is no good reason to think a vegan or vegetarian diet is any less healthy than an omnivorous one. Under the assumptions previously covered, that all beings have the right to equal consideration of interests, and that animals are not exempt from this, there is no legitimate argument to support the idea that it is acceptable to kill them to pleasure one’s palate. The equation is very simple, the interest in eating a particular meal because one might think it is tasty is immensely outweighed by any being’s interest to live and not be used. No argument proposing that an animal’s lack of any particular quality grants the right to end their life for such trivial ends can stand in the context of how rights are distributed in western society, should they agree that the right to equal consideration of interests extends to animals. That idea, while not present in earlier western culture, permeates the current culture. Abuse of house animals is illegal, punishable, and highly looked down upon. The fact that these laws do not extend to other animals (of often greater intellectual capacity), rendering these laws poorly reasoned and inconsistent is beside the point. This alone illustrates that we believe that animals have some level of rights and should have their interests considered. If one believes that animals should not be granted the right to equal consideration, the only logical conclusion is that there should be no issues with this abuse, since animal interests should not be considered at any level. To address your point, """"there are many food items that can be obtained from animals that not only cause no harm, but are a natural part of their life cycle"""", that is absurd. The vast majority of animal agriculture practices involve molestation and theft, not to mention a non-consensual imprisonment and force-breeding. Eating products born from these practices (found on so-called ethical farms) is condoning and supporting them, therefore immoral. sources and further reading: &gt; http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/bentham1780.pdf (Bentham) &gt; http://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil3140/Regan.pdf (Regan) &gt; https://nwveg.org/files/Singer_The_Animal_Liberation_Movement.pdf (Singer, this is a great one)"
CMV: It is illogical for vegans to completely abstain from the consumption of animal products,cephius,0,"Yakno_what, you are correct that there exist more humane ways to source animal products that do not involve factory farming and direct animal suffering. However, I invite you to ponder as to whether or not these more humane sourcing methods are environmentally/economically viable with the current global demand of animal products. Note that land usage and labor requirements are going to increase as the treatment of these animals becomes more humane. With this in mind, there's a bit of a balancing act between animal suffering and environmental degradation in the animal agriculture industry; as one decreases, the other is going to tend to increase. If you accept this as true, would it be illogical to opt-out of the animal agriculture market in order to curb our cultural dependence on animal suffering and unsustainable agricultural practices?"
CMV: It is illogical for vegans to completely abstain from the consumption of animal products,PotemkinCityLimits,0,"I think your definition of veganism is a little bit simplistic.

Many vegans (myself included) would have absolutely no problem with eating something like lab meat when it is commercially viable in the future. The reason I don't eat free range eggs is that even on free range farms, the hens get killed as soon as they stop producing. Even on free range farms they are usually debeaked without pain relief and even on the free range farms the baby male chicks are ground up alive within their first few hours of being born simply because males don't lay eggs. The reason I went vegan was solely because I don't want to contribute to animals being killed and abused, I would have no problem hypothetically eating an animal product that didn't cause any harm, suffering or death to any animal, but it's important to understand that really is just a hypothetical situation because the meat, dairy and eggs you find in the supermarket all came from animals that suffered their whole lives in factory farms and suffered again when they were killed in a slaughterhouse. The reason the vast majority of people go vegan is the same reason I did, so that less animals have to suffer and die.

CMV: It is illogical for vegans to completely abstain from the consumption of animal products,[deleted],0,"&gt; I know many rural farmers (and a few hipsters) who have a chicken coop that provides more eggs than they can eat. I can personally attest that they are some happy ass birds. Chickens are genetic experiments. They are not supposed to be pooping out unfertilised eggs every day, we made them that way, and it causes malnourishment. The real issue here though is whats known as 'brooding'. Essentially that means chicken depression. Theyre simple beasts who are hardcoded to reproduce but their eggs never turn into babies. Instead we collect and eat them. This causes 'brooding'. A hen will sit in her eggs trying to incubate them for weeks at a time, showing clear emotional distress when you approach her. The way to deal with it is known as 'breaking' the hen. It generally involves putting them in a cage for a few days, or otherwise fucking with them until they stop. I had chickens at a sharehouse i lived in and i saw it. Its pretty fucked up. &gt;We can extrapolate my argument into the very realistic near future. With the advent of man made meat (or honey) - there will be loss of life or any pain inflicted at all so any qualms about eating a burger go right out the window.

CMV: It is illogical for vegans to completely abstain from the consumption of animal products,omid_,1,"I've noticed this so many times now, where people come up with these hypothetical scenarios where these chickens just come out of nowhere and lay eggs only for humans. Sorry, but that's not how the real world works. The simple reality is that meat, and animal products in general, **are energy inefficient**. It takes more energy to produce an egg than you get from it. So in that sense, it is unethical to raise chickens and give them food for eggs, because the food you give to the chickens is food that could have been given to a human being. So for me, the issue is opportunity cost. I don't know the specific amount for eggs, but for flesh, it takes 10 units of energy to get 1 unit of energy from consuming the flesh, since 9 of the units are consumed by the animal for homeostasis. Right now, nearly 1/3 of Earth's arable land is being used for feed crops. Think about how much more total food we would have if we used that land to grow food for ourselves. There are billions of cows, chickens, pigs, sheep, etc. that are basically draining our resources for no good reason. Even if you don't care about animal suffering, the 2nd law of thermodynamics results in meat being energy inefficient, and ultimately, inhibiting human potential. And of course, climate change. Also, veganism is a general lifestyle stance, not a religion. If I really did have no choice but to eat a freshly killed dog to survive on a desert island, I would. It's not a """"sin"""" to consume animal flesh. However, in th real world, meat is a choice, and completely unnecessary for human survival. And as I mentioned above, it is in fact detrimental to human survival when you consider the opportunity cost.

CMV: It is illogical for vegans to completely abstain from the consumption of animal products,Smol-Angry-Potato,0,"I think illogical is a bit of incorrect phrasing here. I'll explain more concisely in the TLDR because this will take a bit of explaining, sorry for the bulky mobile format. I do get what you mean from browsing a few comments because most vegans I've met and myself chose to abstain because of ethical or moral reasons as opposed to logical reasons I suppose. These can be religious in nature or solely individual beliefs. I use the phrase logical here to mean financially beneficial, environmentally beneficial, and common sense. I believe vegan is a logical choice, but again most vegans I know didn't go vegan for the logical reasons. Just from an initial glance, it does seem illogical in a sense to abstain from animal products when they're just...there, and so accessible, especially in excess like in the USA (where I'm from). But animal products are never just there. Like for dairy and cheese, it's just biologically unnatural for one species to drink the milk of another. It's why whole milk can give people upset stomachs, because the fat content isn't something we need or were evolved to need. Dogs don't drink the milk from cats, and we don't question why because it's just not natural. So it might taste good, but for health and nature's sake it isn't logical to drink milk or eat dairy products. And eggs are always actively taken from chickens. Even if you own the chicken yourself you have to take their eggs from their nests. You can treat a chicken well, but you're still taking something from them without consent. Consent is a rather loaded term, but in the most basic sense: Chicken has an egg, human sees egg, human takes egg, Chicken no longer has their egg. Chickens can never verbally give consent, but beyond that eggs are meant for the chickens. My aunt actually owned a few on her farm for a while (she rented out the crop land though), and she let the chickens keep the """"excess"""" eggs (sje took 1 or 2 daily) because the chickens would eat them to gain back the nutrients they lost in making the eggs. NOTE: I can't link on mobile but if I find a study for that I'll write the info or link it on my computer tomorrow. Eggs are also high in cholesterol, which humans don't need. So if chickens will eat their own eggs, and they're not super healthy/necessary for humans, it's not really logical to eat them. It's just personal craving/taste. There's also a lot of people on the planet who just have difficulty digesting animal products, or who have allergies to animal products. I personally have gastritis and Barrett's esophagus, so if I did eat meat and dairy it would cause a lot of pain, discomfort, and acid reflux which would make the disorders worse. I developed it 2 years after going vegan since I have a family history, but even if I wasn't vegan it just wouldn't make sense for me to eat animal products because they'd be causing me physical pain and intestinal damage. NOTE: not just animal products, I have to avoid a lot of foods, but animal products cause more severe reactions. Even if people don't have a disorder, meat is just a bit tougher to digest. Meat and dairy products in larger amounts will cause constipation or delayed bowel movements. They also can be very very high in cholesterol, depending on the product, which again isn't helpful at all to health. Cholesterol is only found in animal products, and if you have high cholesterol (genetically), it's only logical that you at least try to avoid these products. For animal farming, it's also a bit worse for the environment. It produces a lot of Carbon dioxide. It also takes up a lot of land to make the feed for animals in factories/farms. People have asked me things along the lines of """"well, if we aren't eating them, what are we supposed to do with cows/chickens/pigs?"""" I mean...just let them do their thing. We have dogs and cats and birds as pets but we don't ever feel the need to eat them because they're there. Squirrels, pigeons, deer, and stray cats and dogs also aren't avidly used in commercial products just because we can eat them and they're around. In all fairness if we were to just release all factory animals right now, we'd be absolutely bombarded by cows and chickens and pigs and we'd be totally fucked in all honesty. An immediate release isn't logical or practical or ethical. And if everyone on the planet were to go vegan, we'd need tons and tons of land to plant soy, quinoa, grain, vegetables, and fruit to properly feed everyone. NOTE: assuming """"everyone"""" in this sense means everyone who has access to foods, ie. Everyone who is eating well NOW). Immediate fixes aren't logical at all. We'd have no land for all the newly wild animals and not enough land for crops. That's why vegans totally abstain on an individual level. It's why a lot will kind of annoyingly pander to friends and others in the hopes that a few will """"convert"""". These slow changes are what's logical. They're what's most benefical to the environment and they make the most logistic sense (ie. Slowly increasing cropland and reducing animals in factories) TLDR: The moral reasons for being vegan are a lot more popular and easily worded and popularly advertised (ie. EATING MEAT IS CRUELTY!! IMMORAL!! SAVAGE!!) than logical reasons (ie. WE ARE NOT INTENDED TO EAT ANIMAL PRODUCTS SUCH AS DAIRY BECAUSE IT MAKES NO BIOLOGICAL SENSE AND IT'S UNNATURAL AND DOESN'T REALLY HAVE AN INHERENT EVOLUTIONARY ADVANTAGE!!). This doesn't mean that it's illogical for vegans to totally abstain, it just means that it's a bit more difficult for people to see the logic when most of the arguing and belief system is focused on ethics."

Birkenstocks for men? The height of unreason. 99% of every culture, everywhere, at any point of history? I think you can see where this is going.

Except that some people disagree because their field of options is different. They think that what you consider """"not harmed"""" is still an abuse of the animal. Hell, some of them may simply choose that path because a voice coming out of their grandmother's metal cross on the wall told them not to. When you throw around words like """"logic"""" and """"reason"""", you have to be careful to consider every single option on the table, and some of them go far, far beyond our experience and preferences.

That's you disagreeing with one reason why a Vegan may choose to not use animal products. This is mostly a false representation of the totality of a vegan's reasons to not use animal products, and is more likely the most shallow version of that belief. It's an easy case to make that factory farming is unnecessarily cruel, but the reason why it is labeled cruel is due to larger aspects of vegan ethics. A vegan won't take a chicken's egg even if the chicken is in the wild, not because it wouldn't be natural to do so, but because it would interfere with the chicken's autonomy to have young or to do as it pleases. As thinking animals, we have the ability to subdue our predatory to urge so as to not interfere with that autonomy. FYI, many vegans are perfectly fine with lab grown meat. However, many vegans (and myself, a vegetarian) genuinely don't see the point of trying to fake the meat experience.

CMV: Veganism is ineffective at changing majority of what it aims to change,TDawgUK91,0,"I think it's quite clear that vegans are having an influence on the market. This is only my personal observation, but supermarkets seem to stock a bigger range of products aimed at vegans (e.g. milk- and meat-alternatives), there is better labelling of foods as vegetarian/vegan, and restaurants/cafes have more vegan options. It's much harder to detect the effect looking the other way (i.e. the effect on the meat industry itself) because of the much smaller proportional impact (e.g. if, hypothetically, the number of vegans has increased from 0.5% to 1% of the population, then the vegan food market has doubled while the meat market has only decreased by &lt;1%). Secondly, switching to a vegan diet makes a significant impact on your personal carbon footprint. On average, food accounts for about 10-20% of your total carbon footprint, and switching to a vegan diet can approximately halve this (figures from [Shrink That Footprint](http://shrinkthatfootprint.com)). We're often told that we should do things like unplug phone chargers when we're not using them to save energy, but such actions make only a trivial impact on your personal energy use so that even if everyone did it, the impact would still be pretty minimal (I think I saw a calculation that if everyone in the UK did this, it would save enough enery to power Canterbury Cathedral). Veganism is not like that - if everyone did it, it's impact would be very significant. As for being effective at persuading other people to change, I certainly agree that some vegans can come across as arrogant and see themselves as morally superior. Firstly, I would argue that for most vegans, the decision is primarily a personal one and that changing the views of others is not one of their objectives. Secondly, if you are interested in changing the attitudes of others, I think that vegans can be effective, if they communicate reasonably and sensibly (which unfortunately doesn't seem to happen very often). It would be hypocritical to tell other people to reduce their meat consumption if you haven't done so yourself, and you're far more likely to be successful at convincing people that there are tasty, nutritious vegan meals if you have some experience of them. Also, for many vegans switching to 'ethically' sourced products doesn't achieve the outcome they want to achieve. Many vegans are against the killing of animals altogether, and from an environmental point of view 'ethical' sourcing often actually requires more resources - factory farms are designed to be incredibly efficient."

Anyone who has attended college in the last 25 plus years knows someone who for some period of time was a hardcore vegan and later returned to a more conventional diet. That individual, arguably, was ineffective in so far as they may have been off-putting to others in their strict views and then later appeared to be hypocritical. So the individual is ineffective. But the practice of going vegan has shown remarkable staying power and people like that have contributed to a movement that exceeds their own individual actions. That movement has introduced countless people to the idea that they don't need to eat meat at every meal, that dairy alternatives can be just as good or better, etc. If nothing else, it educates - you can't just dismiss a vegan diet as absurd or unworkable once you've been exposed to it. And *that* impacts consumer choices into the future."
CMV: Veganism is ineffective at changing majority of what it aims to change,PandaDerZwote,0,"Thats not the fault of veganism. If I believe that using animals to produce anything for me to consume (milk, eggs, meat) is wrong, I don't want to advocate for better conditions for animals, I want (at least, in an ideal world) to have no animals used for these kind of things. I would say """"human conditions"""" for animals is not what veganism wants. Its like saying you are against slavery, having better conditions for slaves is NOT what you want, you want to abolish slavery on its own. Veganism is effective enough, if everyone did it. Of course, one vegan isn't saving the earth from the pollution from domesticated animals, just as much as one person who consumes meat isn't destroying the whole planet. When vegans are a minority, their impact is small, but the whole thing is not binary, its not 1 and 0, its not """"Planet saved"""" and """"Planet not saved"""". This argument isn't really sound, its like saying """"Not littering is ineffective, because as long as there are people who litter, littering is still a problem"""", you are part of the solution if you are not littering, that doesn't make the problem of littering go away entirely as long as there are other people who still do, but you make a difference, otherwise you could say everybody can litter and it has no effect at all, which is obviously false."
CMV: Veganism is ineffective at changing majority of what it aims to change,FromTheIsle,0,"I believe if we all make conscious choices to improve our buying habits no matter what it is, the market will bend itself towards efficiency in that regard. And to a degree, that is how the markets aleady work. So while I agree with your concern that some vegans, like many over zealous types, can be entirely too """"all or nothing,"""" conscious improvement should not go unappreciated. Unfortunately, because of the society that most of the 1st world finds itself in, dramatic change would require an equally dramatic stimulus. This can often be depressing and self defeating for individuals who want to improve the world. But fortunately, the power of the hive mind has allowed us the ability to work as one with relatively little effort. What I'm saying is that a million little gestures, a million little changes, can change the whole direction of man kind. Maybe not in your life time (as is often the chagrin of progressive types), but you will tip the boat in either one direction or the other. And if that doesn't do it for you. Human goodness or destruction is neither a good or bad thing. The universe existed for a very long time before us and will continue on despite our deepest neglect. Humans are only trying to change for themselves, selfishly. For better or for worse. Regardless, remaining positive in your outlook is often a better vehicle for change than looking at it all as pointless."

Let's say he decides for himself that he'll use the car anyway on days when he's really busy. Is he now suddenly selfish because he decides to use the car sometimes? To a certain degree, maybe - but certainly not enough to call *him* out on it specifically, as all his collegues are still using *their* cars daily. The fact of the matter is that veganism is difficult (and arguably unhealthy when done long-term) and vegetarianism is easy.

How do vegans who consume these crops justify this? They could simply grow their own food which would undoubtedly cause less deaths. The reality is that everyone decides for themselves where they want to draw the line. The average vegan would still be """"inherently selfish"""" by your terms—at which point we're not arguing whether someone is selfish or not, it's simply a question of where they put their priorities. I would say that applies beyond one's diet as well. Everyone makes choices in life that usually help themselves more than others.

CMV: Ethical Vegetarians are inherently selfish.,therapy,0,"I'd like to raise two arguments here. First of all, I think some ethical vegetarians make sure to eat dairy products from organic and cruelty-free farms, where the cows have free room for pasture, and so forth. The amount of suffering they undergo is far, far lower than factory farmed animals. So at least that group of ethical vegetarians is far closer to vegans than to meat eaters, in terms of suffering caused, even if they are somewhere in the middle. Is that group of vegetarians a large one? I'm not sure if surveys were done. But based on personal experience, ethical vegetarians generally care a lot more about factory farming than meat eaters do. Second of all, I believe suffering is a more general thing than just animal suffering. While the medical bodies all agree a vegan diet can be perfectly healthy for most people, some people do not fare well on it. It could be because of some digestive factor, or because someone might be working two jobs to support their family and not have the time to ensure a perfect and healthy vegan diet for them all. In such cases, I think that to be a vegetarian might be ethical, in that it reduces suffering for that person and/or their dependents, even if it does cause some amount of animal suffering. I say """"might"""" because it depends on the details - just eating dairy out of laziness seems a weak reason, for example. But I do believe there are cases where being mostly vegan but eating some dairy now and then, might be justifiable from the point of view of minimizing suffering."
CMV: Ethical Vegetarians are inherently selfish.,alecbenzer,0,"Causing less harm is still better and less selfish than causing more harm (even if there are those that cause even less harm).

And the more common vegetarianism becomes, the less radical Veganism seems to society. Without the adding buying power from vegetarians, vegans may not be able to enjoy as many restaurant dishes or packaged foods. Many of the veggie burgers for example were made with vegetarians in mind, and it's only later that some of the premade veggie burgers were easily available in vegan form. Anyone that helps vegans is indirectly helping your cause. Many people transitioning to Veganism must go through an internal process. Vegetarianism is a logical middle ground, as the person adjusts. If you vilify the vegetarian, you vilify anyone who is *trying* to change. Some vegetarians truly are ignorant of commercial dairy and egg production. To them, they are acting as ethically as they can about their diet. Judging them and calling them selfish doesn't address the information defecit.

It's no use hating on vegetarian peeps, it's the structure of our society we need to change. It's the mindset of seeing other beings as resources to be used, the industries and systems we have built up so that killing things is the easiest solution to our problems. It's a big mess, and you're focussing on the wrong part of it. Vegies are just trying to survive in this situation like the rest of us. It's like walking away from Omelas. There are no good choices, just compromises and justifications. We have to change the way we do things so the torture of animals isnt the default. Vegans and vegetarians and people who care about the welfare of animals need to work to make it so the exploitation of others is no longer the basis of our society. The way we do this is **not** individual consumer choices, it's collective action. We can sort out our differences later, but ultimately, at the moment, there are no ethical choices in capitalism. Everyone is doing their best according to their own version of best, but an individual cannot make much of a difference, and it's a capitalist fairytale to believe that my shopping preferences are going to save the world.

CMV: Ethical Vegetarians are inherently selfish.,fairpear,0,"I responded to one of your other comments, but I wanted to make a direct post about something different. First, you can be a vegetarian for ethical reasons that are not based out of concern for animals, i.e. the environment, land use, etc. However, I think it was your intention to define """"ethical vegetarians"""" the ones that do it out of ethical concern for animals, so I won't focus on that. One selfless reason that one could choose to be vegetarian rather than vegan is for """"concern"""" for one's friends and family. It sounds like BS, but hear me out. I personally know people who eat and purchase vegan every chance they get, but they label themselves as vegetarian. The reason is that they have tried strict veganism, but it has somewhat alienated their friends and family. Activities with other focuses can suddenly become all about the vegan and what they can or can't do. In these situations, it may be less selfish to eat something with an animal byproduct in it than to shift focus onto yourself and off of whatever it should be. It may be less selfish to eat something with an animal byproduct in it than to waste food if it's already been ordered or prepared for you, etc. Being vegan may not be a big inconvenience to the person doing it, but it may be to others. Staying with in-laws? A different breakfast, just for you. A second Thanksgiving meal prepared just for you. A second pot of dumplings, just for you. A different restaurant, just for you. How much am I inconveniencing an animal versus my friends and family if one of them slips up and puts """"the wrong kind of fake cheese"""" on my food?"
CMV: Ethical Vegetarians are inherently selfish.,DrunkFishBreatheAir,0,"I'm a vegetarian in a sort of utilitarian sense. Looking at the tradeoff between difficulty and cruelty. Giving up meat and staying healthy was very easy and stopped a lot of killing, giving up dairy/eggs will be very high effort and stop smaller scale cruelty. I... agree that it's a flawed philosophy, and I at some point plan to transition to veganism, but for now I'm fairly ok with where I stand. I have a pet snake, who I don't hesitate to feed mice, because he needs it to survive. I don't really see using animals to eat as strictly wrong, but instead see it as a tradeoff that I'm unwilling to make for my own satisfaction, whereas veganism is difficult enough that I settle in the middle."

I was on the fence about going vegan, but I really don't see the need. Right now I eat eggs and dairy in a selfish way (no argument there) because I buy them from stores and companies I haven't had proper time to research. Still...given a little more time I think I could become a selfless vegetarian. For example my mother raises chickens. She takes very good care of four, and sometimes I barter with her for eggs. They're not in pain, and removing their eggs does seem to cause any separation anxiety or suffering, so I'm cool with it. She talked about butchering them, but she's kind of attached now. The biggest problem is she lives several hours away...I thought about finding someone similar on Craigslist, but I live out in the boondocks, so maybe I could raise a couple on my own? I don't think there's anything intrinsically wrong with dairy either...just the way that most companies handle it. Ideally there shouldn't be pain/suffering from simply milking a cow. Some say stealing milk from the calf produces suffering, but I've heard others say milk production is more than enough. I'm not a farmer, so again...research. Lastly, why bother with such a huge effort and not just go full vegan? Well because I still like the taste. There are some amazing substitute products out there, but others not so much. Soy milk's alright, but the taste/texture isn't nearly the same. Same for nut ch eese (its legit, I swear) and egg substitute."

I feel no moral responsibility to be vegetarian or vegan. CMV.,I-HATE-REDDITORS,0,"Others have explained the problems with the modern meat industry pretty well but I'd like to add the following two points: - Animal agriculture is one of the worst industries for worker welfare. Many workers are undocumented immigrants and the turnover rate is very high. They're paid poorly and exposed to a lot of stress. The industry is notable for its occurrence of worker injury as well. - The meat industry is responsible for 80% of the antibiotics used in the United States. This is a big deal. The next catastrophic plague will probably originate in a factory farm. The disease responsible for the [1918 flu pandemic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic) that killed 4% of the world's population is believed to have originated with animal agriculture. We're keeping birds and pigs in filthy conditions and giving them an incredible amount of antibiotics. It's Russian roulette. &gt; """"Eating meat supports an immoral industry."""" Only if I buy my meat from those immoral sources. There are other ways to come by meat or animal products and places to buy it that do not torture the creatures while they're alive. It's impossible to meet the current demand for meat without factory farming. If you're contributing to that demand, you're part of the problem. Ethical small farms can offset factory farms but only so much. Also, due to USDA regulations written by the meat industry, a lot of ethical small farms are still required to send their animals to large facilities for slaughter and processing. You might have 50 small family farms, but they all are sending their cows to the same factory-style slaughterhouse, incurring all the problems that go with it."

CMV.,steamisashimi,0,"The ethics regarding how humans relate to animals, whether they are our pets, zoo animals, cattle, hostile beasts, or part of the ecosystem we rely on, is all really fishy (unintended pun :) and inconsistent, for a variety of good/bad reasons. We can attack that issue from all sorts of angles, but ultimately the way we relate to animals is very complex and depends on many circumstances. Because it varies widely from culture to culture and depends highly on the circumstances and your own moral premises, I'm not going to attempt to argue this point even though there is a ton under there. Let's focus on the environmental ethics involved, which you haven't explicitly addressed yet, and understandably so since our ethics regarding living things is much more salient than our ethics towards the larger ecosystem of the world; I think that's why, when it comes to vegetarianism, we tend to hear a lot about animal rights and not so much about the environmental destruction, even though the latter will substantially affect the well-being of humans, which I will presume to be at a high level of ethical importance to you and me both. /u/potrockss has brought up some relevant issues regarding our consumption patterns, which makes eating meat somewhat equivalent to wastefully burning fossil fuels/polluting. In the case you consider that to be ethically problematic, then allow me to expand. Here is one important metric: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_conversion_ratio In short, it takes 2 calories of feed to produce 1 calorie of poultry, pork is around 3-4:1, and beef is &gt;6:1. This doesn't take into account of destructive land use, transportation costs, methane release, etc. In short, it's obvious that eating steaks everyday will pollute many times more than a vegetarian diet would; so even substituting 50% of your meat with veggies, there would be an enormous reduction in the energy required and pollution emitted for sustaining your lifestyle. But maybe you feel that your responsibility for the protecting of the environment is so diluted with such a diffused negligible impact on any person or society that you can't help but ignore it. Then, anything to do with waste (i.e. throwing away food) or pollution (i.e. driving terribly inefficient cars) would also be morally insignificant. **TL;DR** So really where we need to start with is whether you take that moral premise of environmental harm to be part of your moral calculus (i.e. individual environmental impact to be something morally responsible for), and then from there we can demonstrate how eating meat would be more immoral than a vegetarian diet. *This all being said, eating food is a complex thing, involving not only morals but culture, socializing, and personal freedom, so I don't think any strict moral statement would ever define your diet, but probably might influence it once you understand what's actually at steak (stake) here. edit: clarifications"

That seems impossible. If the foundation for your belief is off limits, then I don't see any way of changing your belief. What sort of discussion will you permit that could theoretically lead you to change your view? I'll take a stab at something: I don't know which domains your religion has claimed for itself, so I'll go ahead and ask a question about evolution: At what stage of human evolution did our ancestors become human in the morally relevant sense? Did parents who were morally irrelevant have children who were morally relevant? I don't think that there's any reason to believe that to be the case, but I'd be interested in hearing a plausible explanation.

I feel no moral responsibility to be vegetarian or vegan. CMV.,potrockss,0,"I don't think I've seen it here, but have you considered the environmental impacts of large amounts of meat being farmed? While not **necessarily** advocating complete abstinence from meat (I'm not a veggie) but perhaps a change to a reduction in consumption? I am speaking off-hand here, so I don't have numbers and many examples, but I believe this is an argument that could be made for a vegetarian or reduced consumption lifestyle. * Beef produces a lot of methane which is a short lived but very harmful greenhouse gas. It also takes a lot more grain and space over a lot more time to produce equivalent amount of beef. This for me doesn't make a lot of sense, when it just takes so many more resources to produce, and we're running out of space etc on this planet. YES it may not make a difference directly if you do it, but a general change in mindset to more sustainable consumption practices could remove a lot of the pressure that is put on land. On a slight side-note, some of the opponents of Marine Protected Areas and exclusion of fishing from these areas talk in terms of Orangutans lost because of this exclusion of fishing. That is, the displacement of resource collection from the sea to rainforests. While not exactly like this, one could think about the amount of rainforest destruction that occurs from the land-intensive beef farming in Argentina etc. This example applies generally, where you could think of the cost of your meat to natural systems. **So, while not blameless, farming plants generally has a reduced environmental impact on natural systems, causing fewer extinctions etc** * With fishing, as well, many stocks are over-exploited and likely to collapse. Additionally, bycatch rates can be high (90%+ in the shrimp or prawn industries for example, can't remember which). That means a lot of the catch is just discarded. Add to that the destructive fishing methods of many industries and fishing starts to look a lot like genocide. The **actual** amount of life and habitat lost is a lot greater than just that one fish on your plate. Another sidenote, on fishing, we often consume the larger and more tasty fishes. They are really high in the food chain, and thus a lot of the energy is lost in their growth and the growth of the trophic levels below them. Tuna, for example, are at the 5th trophic level. That would be equivalent, on land, to eating something that eats a wolf-eater. The energy input-output just doesn't make sense. Yes, they are luxurious, but I would advocate eating smaller fishes. They are a lot more nutritious, and a lot more energy-efficient. My main problem with eating meat is not the killing of individual animals but the impact that their removal and farming may have on already stressed environments. I would advocate for smart and sustainable consumption, and knowing where your food comes from. In a way, minor vegetarianism I guess. For some people, this may not be enough and would be a reasoning for vegetarianism that I could understand. EDITED: hit submit early"

Therefore, if you participate in the practice of eating animals, you are contributing to their deaths (and very probable suffering) simply for your enjoyment rather than any sort of necessity. I'd like to throw out a couple of factoids here, too: -Vertebrate species (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish) all have more or less the same type of nervous systems and feel pain much like us. -Eating animals or animal products is not necessary for human health and well-being. -Not eating animals and animal products saves energy and resources.

We know that many species experience trauma at the death of relatives, many provide extensive paternal care, engage in social learning, etc. Animals are not on the same level as a computer program. Animal behaviors are often complex and puzzling. The fields of animal behavior and behavioral ecology repeatedly reveal surprises in what animals do and how we think they think.

[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5&amp;q=do+plants+feel+pain) is even more dismissive; literally *no one* will stake their academic reputation on the idea plants feel pain. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and the idea that a creature without a brain could have feelings would completely rewrite the disciplines of psychology, neurology, computational science and artificial intelligence. Forget about your hamburger - use this knowledge to cure autism! Philosophically we should also be worried about the claim plants feel 'pain'; there is a diverse philosophical literature suggesting that pain without sentience is not the same as pain *with* sentience. In other words, if plants don't have a concept of 'self' then we should be less worried if they feel pain, because the pain is not something that affects an individual. To put this another way, my computer can tell if it is getting too hot to function, but because my computer is not sentient I don't worry that this stress response to external stimuli is functionally the same as the pain response I get when I burn my hand. Yet *even if* we can somehow get around the lack of evidence and lack of philosophical plausibility in this argument, we are still faced with a 'balance of harms' problem. Humans need to consume a certain number of calories a day to survive, and most people think humans are more important than all other life-forms on the planet (we might note that the people making this claim tend to be humans themselves, but that's neither here nor there!). However, just because we *must* eat either plants or animals does not mean that there is *no difference* between eating plants and animals. To put this another way, I could consume my RDA of calories by eating my parents, but that is evidently unethical. *Even if* plants feel pain, you would have to show me that the pain caused by me eating a nice broccoli risotto is greater than the pain caused by killing and eating a cow **and** the pain caused to the plants used to feed that cow. I doubt you can, because the second law of thermodynamics indicates that the cow must eat more plants than I do in order to provide me with the same number of calories. So I don't think your second point is true, and even if it *is* true I don't think it shows what you think it does and *even if* it does you'd have to invalidate the second law of thermodynamics before it proved what you thought it did."

"I think moral vegetarianism is wrong and maybe even pointless, CMV",raserei0408,0,"Let's take it point by point. 1. If their profit margin is hurt because they raise and slaughter more animals than are sold, they will raise and slaughter fewer animals to improve their bottom line. The """"quota"""" you mention is a function of the amount that stores order which is in turn a function of how much people buy. Any individual's effort is largely inconsequential, but collectively they make a sizable difference. 2. Some research suggests that plants can feel pain. However, we know for a fact that animals feel pain. Additionally, is it equally immoral to cause equal pain to any being? Many people feel that it's less immoral to cause pain to beings that are further from us genetically. Finally, tons of people have reasons to be vegetarian unrelated to causing pain to other beings. 3. Substitute """"suffering"""" for """"pain"""" in the above paragraph and it works equally well here. 4. Consider this: Let's say one """"animal"""" worth of energy (i.e. the chemical energy stored in an animal) causes N animals to die when the energy comes from plant-based food. Now, the energy cost of raising one """"animal"""" worth of meat is going to be 10 animals worth of plant-based food (this is a fairly well-accepted guideline in biology). That means that, discounting the actual animal that the meat comes from, an animal of meat kills 10N animals (so really 10N + 1). Not eating meat doesn't make the number of animals zero (except in extreme cases) but it does reduce it by an order of magnitude. I'll leave you with a couple other thoughts: Not everyone who is a vegetarian is so for the same reason. Some are for dietary/health reasons, some are for moral reasons, some are for environmental reasons (factory farming animals has an absurd effect on the environment), and some for even others. Even among those who are vegetarian for moral reasons, the specific reasons range from """"I don't want to kill animals to eat them"""" to """"I think the specifics of how our meat is raised in factory farms is horrific."""" The idea that because a system isn't perfect it isn't an improvement is a logical fallacy into which I think you may have fallen. It's nigh impossible to not consume any products that involved the killing of animals in our current world, but your bullet points suggest that it's not worth taking any effort to reduce the number if it can't be reduced to zero, which is a something I contest strongly. I'll entertain your assertion that vegetarianism is pointless, but I'm curious as to why you think it is *wrong* (however you choose to define that; I was thinking something along the lines of actively amoral). The arguments you offered seemed to suggest that vegetarians and vegans aren't making a difference (which I disagree with) but none of them suggest to *me* that they are doing anything actively malicious or bad."
"I think moral vegetarianism is wrong and maybe even pointless, CMV",unsettlingideologies,0,"I agree with others here. For me, the key to addressing 2 and 3 seems to be that the animals people would eat have spent their lives eating plants. Biologists pretty much agree that only about 10% of the energy is kept from one level to the next in the """"food chain."""" This means that in order to get our energy from animals, roughly ten times as much plant needs to be harvested as if we got our energy straight from animals. I will concede that there are ways to harvest from plants (like the bear eating berries example you used in one comment) that don't necessarily kill the plant. I don't know whether these methods would harm the plant (assuming we grant that plants experience harm/pain), but I think it's irrelevant. Any method that could be used to harvest food from plants to feed livestock could be used to harvest food from plants to feed people directly. In other words, if there's a method to minimize the harm to plants when feeding animals, we could minimize it even further if we just use that same method to feed humans directly. So humans eating meat is necessarily causing less harm (even to plants) than humans eating plants."
"I think moral vegetarianism is wrong and maybe even pointless, CMV",sbuddh,0,"1. As pezz said, you've got to start somewhere. Reducing demand for meat will, over time, reduce the quotas. I've never heard of livestock being released. That would be an extremely bad practice as far as damage to local ecosystems. As sort of an aside, you seem to equate animals dying with animals suffering. I can only speak for myself, but I, as a vegetarian, don't share this view. (For example, I don't have a big problem with hunting for food). One other thought: there's the (Buddhist) idea of """"right living"""" which includes abstaining from immoral actions (as differentiated from stopping others from doing something immoral). This sort of position doesn't have to be religious/spiritual; simply the idea """"I think this is wrong, I don't want any part of it."""" 2. First, your source is questionable at best. Plants have no nervous system. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_perception_\(paranormal\)) (see recent research section). Even if they did feel pain, they certainly have no """"minds"""" with which to consciously experience suffering. Since we need to eat something, plants would be, at very least, a reduction in overall suffering. 3. I responded to this above, but I'll add another thought. I don't know that the objectives of vegetarianism include avoiding harming things. In my view, the goal is to prevent suffering by organisms that are capable of experiencing suffering. You haven't explicitly defined """"harming,"""" but I would say it is not equivalent to """"causing suffering."""" And to reiterate point 2: plants don't experience suffering. 4. That Option B has problems does not make Option A suddenly acceptable. These sorts of arguments seem to arise frequently in politics (and everywhere else). They are generally made by those with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, since they tend away from making any change at all. My argument would be: stop Option A, improve Option B. Also, you're comparing 1 million deaths (of freely living animals) due to agriculture to [9 billion deaths (of--I would argue--inhumanely housed animals) in the meat industry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse). That's a 9000x difference before normalizing for the amount of food produced by each method (i.e. calculating animal deaths per calorie produced or something along those lines). Furthermore, a large portion of agricultural products go to raising livestock (you can google around for various estimates of those percentages). Reducing the amount of animals raised for meat would reduce the amount of cropland required and therefore also reduce the amount of animal deaths from agriculture. So to sum up: the goal in my mind (besides the health and environmental reasons for being a vegetarian) is to minimize suffering. I think we would have to agree on a definition of """"harming"""" something to include it in the debate. But killing an organism with no nervous system is to me vastly preferably to causing suffering to an organism with a fully developed nervous system/brain (and, as I said, death != suffering). Finally, let's assume for a second that we know for certain that animals not only feel pain as we do (i.e., consciously, reflectively) but that they are also capable of emotions, of feeling discomfort, that they are """"beings"""" just as we are that we are simply unable to communicate with verbally. Would you still be in favor of keeping them in [inhumane conditions](https://www.google.com/search?q=industrial+livestock+farming&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=1C1LENN_enUS460US460&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6xFAUfHcIYO68ATSooHoDA&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1360&amp;bih=610), of slaughtering them like livestock? I know I wouldn't. Now, of course, we don't know this for certain, but there is increasing evidence for it (e.g., [on the emotions front] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_in_animals#Against_animal_emotion)). And there being a reasonable probability is reason enough for me to make a simple (and truly easy) lifestyle change that has few, if any, drawbacks. You could also argue that environmental concerns are a moral issue, and so environmental reasons would fit with in """"moral vegetarianism,"""" but I won't get into that."

"I think moral vegetarianism is wrong and maybe even pointless, CMV",rhetoricalviking,0,"First of all, props to you for conceding two of your points. I'll try to answer the other two. As a vegetarian, I occasionally get confronted with the question of why I don't care about the feelings of plants. Scientifically, I can say they have no central nervous system so no, I don't think they feel pain, at least not like anything we do. But the easiest way I found to relate to my meat eating friends is we all agree that torturing an animal (even something as trivial as punching a cat) is far worse than cutting grass, picking fruit, or kicking a tree. On a more interesting note though, let's suppose animals feel no pain whatsoever and plants do. Is humanity becoming more carnivorous the moral thing to do? In the developed western world, I'd say no, because most of the animals that we eat were bred and raised for the sole purpose of being eaten, and each of these require vast amounts of plants for themselves. So by turning to more vegetarian diets, we can cut out the 'middle men' and consume less plants than if we fed all the plants to animals first and ate them instead."
"I think moral vegetarianism is wrong and maybe even pointless, CMV",TheLiberalSoup,0,"&gt; Plants might be capable of feeling pain, in which case it defeats what I think is the main reason one would choose vegetarianism. It's hypocritical to condemn pain caused in animals but openly condone pain caused to plants by encouraging their consumption. I don't believe this, because I don't think the science has show that plants feel pain. They don't have a nervous system or a brain, both of which are just necessary. But I don't even need that premise. Suppose plants were to feel pain: a vegan, by consuming less animal products, actually *effectively* consumes less plants, that is they cause less demand for crops. The reason for this is that the plants that go into animal feed are basically wasted on the animals first before their nutrients get to the human meat eater. It takes about 5 pounds of plant protein in feed to produce a single pound of protein in the form of meat. That efficiency rate differs by animal. Pigs it's about 4, cows 7 I think. Chickens 2 or 3. So eating meat is like eating the amount of plants that would give you five times the protein. The World Watch Institute has calculated that livestock account for 50% of global warming. UN said 18% but WWI did what I consider a better analysis, bringing many more factors in."

I think vegetarianism is a disease. CMV.,CluelessRobot,0,"Hi! Vegetarian here. So, I agree, meat is delicious (or, a lot of it, I never really cared for lamb), although I haven't tasted it for a long time now, so it's difficult to be sure. I'm fine with not eating meat now, though. By this point, I don't go to a restaurant and think 'Hey, it's a shame I can't have that steak.' I just don't consider having a steak as an option, really. I've just grown accustomed to it, like someone might if they had an allergy or some other dietary requirement. Point being, being a vegetarian is in no way unpleasant or uncomfortable for me, and it's actually caused me to be more diet conscious and become a better eater. First of all, I disagree with your premise. Whether it's natural or not for people to eat animals, I don't think it's generally desirable, because while animals aren't human beings, they are living and I believe conscious beings (at least, in the latter case, most of them) that can feel pain, and their lives should be treated with some measure of respect. But, let's go with the idea that natural = good. The way most people consume meat isn't natural. If a hunter goes out and shoots a deer, then brings it home to eat it, then as long as it's not endangered and he doesn't over-hunt, he's performing his natural role. He's keeping the ecosystem in balance. That's not the case if you buy a pack of beef that's been raised on a farm. Pigs, sheep, cows, pretty much by definition every regular farm animal is domesticated. We've bred them to be as easy to farm as possible, and we've made their numbers huge 'cause we like eating meat quite a lot. We feed them huge amounts of crops (when it would generally be much more efficient to just eat those crops directly) and pump them full of antibiotics and medicines, both of which can have a huge negative impact on the environment. For example, take a look at [this article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World_vulture#Threat_due_to_diclofenac_poisoning) and scroll to 'Threat due to diclofenac poisoning'. The way most people consume meat is, as far as I can see, very definitely not natural, nor is it from my perspective at all desirable. I don't want to ruin ecosystems because I think they're generally pretty awesome, and I don't want to be responsible for the deaths of any animals. But I probably don't need to tell you if you don't count ecosystems or animals as that worth preserving, we still really, really need to keep our ecosystems in balance, because we are very, very screwed without them. So, hope that's helped / changed your view. (Edited for grammar)"

If I'm eating processed food instead of meat and potatoes, does that make me diseased? Obviously not. You have to realize that if you look at what plants and animals contain, (amino acids, vitamins, various carbohydrates) the two are nearly interchangeable. In many cases, the vegetarian option is *more* nutritious. This is in fact a common reason for people to eat vegetarian- it may have nothing to do with the suffering of animals. Another reason people eat vegetarian is that it is more sustainable. A given area of farmland can feed 10 times as many people (possibly more) if plants are grown instead of cattle or pigs or whatever. Some people simply don't like the taste of meat. Factory meat farms also have horrible practices (even if you overlook animal cruelty). For example, antibiotics are used far in excess, and are a major factor in creating antibiotic resistant strains of diseases that are cropping up around the world. I'll grant that within certain populations some people legitimately depend on meat intake to maintain their health (i.e. the Inuit), but generally speaking, it's perfectly healthy to go without meat."

If people would prefer veggies to steak that's their prerogative."
I think vegetarianism is a disease. CMV.,catjuggler,0,"&gt; It's natural way that animals (in this case people) eat other animals. You're using the naturalistic fallacy. It's not """"natural"""" to live in houses, it's not natural to wear clothes, it's not natural to wear make up, etc. Let's look at the definition of disease: Noun Disease (pathology) An abnormal condition of the body or mind that causes discomfort or dysfunction; distinct from injury insofar as the latter is usually instantaneously acquired. Vegetarianism does not fit.

I think vegetarianism is a disease. CMV.,jfetsch,0,"Fellow carnivore here. You wouldn't eat a person, would you? Animals being killed is mainly a small subset of vegetarians, it's how they get to the point where they would be killed that is the perceived problem. There are a large number of people that don't want to eat animals because of potential similarities between humans and those animals, first and foremost being that animals can feel pain. Many processes that take place in order for a cow to get from birth to your plate a la hamburger can easily be considered cruel and unusual punishment. Many creatures are actually subject to a lot of pain and discomfort before slaughter, and as many of these creatures have similar nervous systems to a human's, it stands to reason that they can feel pain as much as or at least similarly to how we do. A large number of vegetarians do not eat meat in order to prevent these cruel acts from occurring, making as much impact their choices of can make, while others (I know a couple) will only eat meat raised under certain conditions (chicken at chipotle, for example - they have free range something or other, it's all a bit technical for me). At least that's the reasoning behind it all. For a lot of people, it's less """"I will not eat an animal because it is an animal"""" and a lot more """"I won't give the people who regularly subject animals to terrible things my money, because that's similar to saying that I agree with what they do."""" Having heard this argument, my counter is that I don't believe that animals (or at least the main ones we eat) are complex enough to warrant me not eating them, but that's a grey line for every person. Fruit - cow - pig - dog - dolphin - person. Everyone has some point in there where they say """"eating that would just... feel wrong.""""

Many of the animals classified as omnivores, are largely on a diet of nuts, fruits and seeds, with the occasional bugs and worms thrown into the mix. Apes in particular are an example of that.

In addition, this syndrome or pattern must not be merely an expectable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event, for example, the death of a loved one. Whatever its original cause, it must currently be considered a manifestation of a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the individual. **Neither deviant behavior (e.g. political, religious, or sexual) nor conﬂicts that are primarily between the individual and society are mental disorders unless the deviance or conﬂict is a symptom of a dysfunction in the individual, as described above.** So, for one I fully do not believe that the behavior of these extreme dieters fits the definition of """"mental disorder,"""" let alone the more loaded """"mentally ill.""""

A few paragraphs earlier, you said. &gt;I am a foodie. I spend a lot of my free time researching food, creating new recipes, having friends over for culinary adventures. That sounds pretty obsessive to me. Food for me is just a means to an end or something that tastes good. For you it seems a way of life.

The list could go on. So, people who are into pseudo-science? I don't like these kinds of mumbo jumbo either, but I don't call them or people who believe in other mumbo jumbo (astrology, organics, tarot cards, JFK conspiracies, the Atkins diet, religion, etc.) mentally ill.

Vegetarian consumers are still consumers; obviously they're no longer of interest to a company like Perdue, but they're of interest to any other company looking to make a profit. See the proliferation of vegetarian/vegan convenience foods in the past decade as evidence of that.

I pay $7 a pound for breast meat. There's a good chance that the cost of having 5 regulars order the veggie option is going to be less than the cost of switching everything to humane meat or the cost of less business if you pass it onto your regulars. If you start using humane meat, that's an advertising point that will help attract people that want humane meat but will probably help drive away the people that don't care based on how it will affect your price point."

You're wrong, there is an intermediary between them: the food store or restaurants. The vast majority of meat is not bought at speciality butcher shops but rather at supermarkets or restaurants. There, meat is competing for shelf or menu space with all other options. A shift away from people buying meat will mean that that space formally occupied by meat will be replaced by a vegetarian option.

"CMV:If you care about animals, you achieve more by eating the meat of those that were ethically raised, rather than by being a vegetarian.",IceRollMenu2,0,"Very late to the game, but maybe OP still reads this. The animal rights standpoint would be that animals are harmed by being killed, much in the same way that people are harmed by being killed, no matter how nicely it is done. You wouldn't like being killed painlessly tonight, would you! Or, say if you had a mentally disabled cousin, you wouldn't find it OK to kill him in order to eat him, no matter how nicely it's done – because whatever has interests has an interest in continued life, and hence killing them is morally wrong. Notice too that our standards of """"humane"""" or """"ethical"""" slaughter only minimize *unnecessary* suffering, not suffering in general. And what is """"necessary"""" is defined in relation to human wishes. Whatever suffering is needed to get the product we want to be made, is sacrosanct. That's the central premise of animal welfare right there – even our most shallow interests are more important than all animal interests. An example would be that even """"free range,"""" """"organic,"""" """"humane"""" treatment of dairy cows still involves breeding them once a year and separating them from their calves without letting them bond, which has been shown to cause considerable suffering for the animals. Even the most """"humane"""" slaughterhouse requires considerable panic on the part of the animal, both during transport and inside the unfamiliar building. But this is the suffering that is considered necessary to produce the intended product, and hence it is sacrosanct. That's welfarism for you, I think it's bizarre. It's the equivalent of someone saying """"you're against waterboarding? Well then let me waterboard these prisoners on a *padded* waterboard, better?"""" – sure it's a bit better, but it's still not good at all. So you have two lines of argument here: 1. Killing animals *always implies* harming them, no matter how nicely it's done. 2.

I can honestly say I would try just about any type of meat offered to me. I don't think that qualifies me as a devil's advocate, since I understand the desire for a vegan diet but I choose not to. The people who have a vegan diet are entirely capable of eating healthy, even without meat in their diet. Often times, you do have to make the concession that it will require unnatural supplements, but when you consider that the modern western diet is absurdly unnatural anyways it becomes a nonissue. Many vegans choose to do so for moral reasons, as you mentioned. Many of them believe that animals, even in the more humane farming practices, are subject to unnecessary cruelty. They do not wish to support this cruelty, and as such have completely removed the animal industry from their diet. While other animals do indeed need to eat other animals, humans are capable of living on an animal free diet. Your concerns about your friends diet making her look less attractive are entirely subjective. Your view on her attractiveness is very likely not to be a universally agreed upon. Whether or not she is consuming an appropriate vegan diet is important too, and if she just started it, she's likely making some mistakes.

I hope that she gets a better handle on it (it can take time, if you do it without any research, and just eat fruits and vegetables and carbs.) 1) Not every vegan goes vegan because they don't think it's natural to eat the way we do. As you say, we are omnivores. An omnivore means that you can absorb essential nutrients from plant **and** animal sources. This was evolutionarily advantageous (crops were bad one year, you could hunt. Animals were scarce another year, you could rely on crops/gathering). But now, in advanced countries, we don't have to worry about shortages of any food supplies. We can choose where we want to get all of our essential nutrients from. Some of us choose to get all of our nutrients from sources that don't require other animals to die. 2) You say that other animals do it - Of course they do! Other animals also kill each other for territory, kill the offspring of males that aren't theirs, commit rape and incest and all sorts of things, because they don't have our moral reasoning. Civilized society shouldn't rationalize things just because wild animals do them. Not to mention that some animals are obligate carnivores. Even if moral reasoning was a mental performance available to animals other than humans, some animals (like cats) can't get their essential nutrients from any source other than meat. Just like some animals (like guinea pigs) can't get their essential nutrients from any source other than vegetables. Humans are lucky, in that we can get essential nutrients from both. So we can *choose* how to absorb our nutrients. 3) You say she's unattractive now. It's possible that she a) hasn't researched the diet very well, b) is camouflaging an eating disorder as veganism, c) got depressed after watching factory farming videos. I can (unfortunately) guarantee you that going vegan does not make you skinny and pale. Sadly, beer, french fries, oreos, skittles, potato chips, and a slew of other bad-for-you foods are all vegan. If she has lost weight, health or vivacity it's not due to the nature of the diet - just her execution of it.

I think people who go full vegan are idiots.CMV.,[deleted],0,"Please excuse my rather long winded rant- &gt;I believe a lot of people who are vegans are just vegan because they want to feel special than everyone else and looking for attention. How do you know this is true? Vegan diets differ greatly from the standard American diet, and if I am not mistaken the initial transition (learning how to cook new things, breaking old habits of buying animal products, etc.) period can be rather difficult. Why would you assume they are going through the difficult transition to a vegan diet when there are much easier ways to stand out? &gt;My friend's life style choice made her look less attractive. Ever since she went vegan she looks too skinny, paler, and overall less healthy. Have you considered that she is happy with her new diet and the way she looks? Besides, it is possible that something else caused her to appear too skinny, paler, and overall less healthy. She could be under a great deal of stress, she could have recently developed a medical condition that she has not yet told you about, or possibly something else could have caused the change in her appearance. As well, you could be experiencing the effects of confirmation bias, that is you could just be favoring evidence that supports your claim. &gt;meat is part of our diets so completely removing meat from our diets isn't healthy. Why is removing meat from out diets unhealthy? Protein is readily available from other sources (various kinds of beans, lentils, quinoa, and many others). Furthermore dietary supplements can be taken to provide any other vitamins or nutrients, however with the right diet they are not always needed. &gt;What's not natural is ingesting supplements as a substitute for the nutrients your body can get from eating animals. Could you please tell me why, exactly, that is wrong (apart from the fact that it is unnatural)? Furthermore, I must say that a large part of your argument is based on one logical fallacy: &gt;1) but humans are omnivores and meat is part of our diets so completely removing meat from our diets isn't healthy &gt;2) What's not natural is ingesting supplements as a substitute for the nutrients your body can get from eating animals. &gt;3) She also mentioned it's cruel to animals to eat them. Thats not entirely true. Animals eat other animals and same goes to humans. Looks like we've got three appeals to nature in your argument. Points 1 and 3 stem from the idea that it is done in nature, so it is right for humans to do it as well. These kinds of arguments are inherently flawed because there are lot's of things occur in nature that aren't necessarily good (murder, rape, infanticide). Point 2 assumes that simply because something is unnatural it is inherently inferior than something natural. The assumption that something because something is natural it is inherently good/better for you is flawed, there are many natural things that are bad for you (snake venom, various poisonous plants, etc.)."
I don't think being vegan is economically fesable for a single person and still be healthy. cmv,misfit_hog,0,"Ok, I am sure you can do this, though your budget is pretty low. First off, buy dry stuff ( beans, rice, lentils, oats etc.) in bulk. That way you have staples you can fall back on. - second, buy fruits and vegetables and tofu ( it's quite nice to have tofu from time to time, it's so versatile!) not at the supermarket, but at the cheapest little fruit and vegetable store you can find. (At least where I live many of those stores are Asian owned and thus have the aforementioned tofu). Third, try to find the time to cook. Most people have more free time than they realise and actually more than enough time to cook something healthy each second day. - why do I say """" each second day?"""" Because cooking bigger quantities of something is just as easy as cooking smaller quantities and nothing goes off within two days. ( if you want you can cook enough stuff for three days, but if you like variety you might get bored...).

So, it sucks and it's totally unfair that those aren't in your price range, but cutting them out of a vegan diet isn't any worse than cutting them out of a vegetarian or omnivorous diet. (Which is to say, unfortunate in both cases.) First, might you qualify for food assistance? Is there a pantry near you? Sounds like you have less than $2.50 a day for food in a bad month, and there are certainly ways to survive on that, even vegan, but none will be optimal. Vegetarian ramen should generally be vegan.

CMV: I believe an ethical vegetarian or vegan diet is morally indefensible and delusional.,content404,0,"I don't eat meat and my reasons for it seem different from most, since when I discuss it with others they tell me they haven't heard this argument against eating meat. In recent years there have been more and more calls from scientists to treat some animals as non-human persons. Those that have been proposed as having person-hood aren't animals we typically eat, like dolphins, chimpanzees, or elephants, but this raises an ethical problem as to what we define as person-hood. We're only just beginning to understand the human mind and the conscious experience, and from what I can tell the difference between our conscious experience is not radically different from those of other non-human persons. We do have more advanced language, technology, etc., but they often share our emotional spectrum. Elephants can suffer from PTSD, have cultural heritage passed down through generations, nuanced communication that we don't fully understand, etc. Considering what we do know and that it indicates there is an enormous amount we don't know about the conscious experience, I do not know where to draw an ethical line about the moral rights of animals. It seems clear to me that most insects do not qualify for person-hood, but as we get closer to humans biologically the distinction becomes less clear. Chickens are profoundly stupid but can certainly experience pain and pigs are surprisingly intelligent. Does the capacity to feel pain and/or human like emotions confer moral status? I think the answer is yes, but I do not know where the line lies between those who have moral rights and those that do not. I try my best to hold to my ethical code, and one item on that list is that non-consensual cannibalism is unacceptable. (If someone left it in their will that it'd be cool if someone ate their corpse then that's fine by me, I wouldn't but I wouldn't stop anyone either.) It's wrong to eat people, which implies that it's also wrong to eat non-human persons. Since I don't know which animals qualify as persons and which do not, I choose to draw a hard line that it's wrong to eat any animals. It's the safe ethical bet, I'm probably going farther than necessary but it guarantees I'm not eating persons that were raised to be slaughtered. **tl;dr** Vegetarianism for me is an extension of my disapproval of cannibalism. Some animals qualify as non-human persons, and it's likely that many more than we know of have significant moral rights as well. If it's wrong to eat a person then it's also wrong to eat non-human persons. Since I do not know which animals qualify as persons and which do not, the simplest way to ensure that I am not eating persons is to not eat animals."

Millions of animals are killed every year to prepare land for growing and harvesting vegetables like corn, soybeans, and wheat, to name a few. Understood. But you must understand, raising animals for food actually requires much more plant food to be grown to feed the animals, which requires even more crop land, and thus by your logic, requires many more animals to die. So veganism or vegetarianism still involves less killing. You might be right that some death is inevitable, but I think it is morally defensible to want to reduce that death."

I've done a bit of research on the topic, watching documentaries like Food Inc and reading books like Meat Market, which has influenced my decision. Here's an excerpt from Meat Market: """"In 1993, at a poultry industry symposium, a British professor of veterinary medicine gave a lecture about layer hen welfare. He told his audience, """"Of live birds arriving at the slaughterhouse, 30 percent have been found to have one or more Freshly broken Bones"""" (19). Beak searing is a common practice used on factory farm chickens to cut off 1/3 of their beaks so they won't peck each other to death when they freak out because they have no space to live. As for eggs, """"more than two million layer hens die from prolapses left untreated each year"""" (20).This is where the chicken's uterus is pushed out while having an egg. These hens are left untreated, and bleed out over two days to suffer a slow, agonizing death. Could these figures be misrepresented? Maybe. I don't know. I think it's just as likely that the meat industry would hide figures like that, though.

It seems like your view needs to be changed back to your original post. I'll copy and paste my essay entry to a NY Times challenge, """"Hey meat eaters, explain why it is ethical to eat meat!"""" I submitted this essay and the farcical """"ethicist"""" chose 5 essays all from vegans / vegetarians... Obviously pseudo-philosophy. In any event, I think my essay explains why you should continue in your previous belief as you articulated it in your title. ---- Keep in mind there was a 600 word limit to the essay: ---- &gt;This contest is to make a case that it is ethical to eat meat. More correctly framed: is it ethically permissible to eat meat? Yes. &gt;There is nothing beyond this latter formulation of this contest’s charge. The formulation of “explain why it is ethical to eat meat” is actually a request to demonstrate why it is merely ethically permissible to eat meat (as opposed to why it is good to do action Φ). &gt;If this contest charged us omnivores to explain that it is good to eat meat, the charge would have looked dramatically different. &gt;The advocate of an herbivorous society would have to pass a high standard: not only that eating meat is not good, but also that eating meat is ethically impermissible. &gt;A proof that it is ethically permissible to eat meat could take one of a number of forms; the tersest is a reductio ad absurdum. Arguendo, then, I assume that the only ethically permissible dietary choice for us is an herbivorous one. &gt;There is no principle to the normative assertion that we must not eat meat, that is, all advocates against eating meat necessarily choose one level of harming animals and then admonish those who disagree with their arbitrary choice. All acts of humans inexorably have unintended consequences. &gt;Even if our entire species was forced to be herbivorous [ignoring the utterly immoral government regulations necessary to implement such a nightmare], the harvesting of crops would either use animals or would use machines that pollute and kill the natural inhabitants of the crops (squirrels, mice, spiders, et cetera) to harvest the plants. &gt;If, on principle, it is impermissible to harm animals, then no dietary choice is ethically permissible. Humans must eat and it is metaethically invalid to have an ethical principle that injures humanity. Therefore, we have found our absurdity and the reductio is complete. Thus, the original assumption is false and its contrary must necessarily be true: an herbivorous dietary choice is not the only morally permissible choice, id est, it is at least ethically permissible to eat meat. What alternative is there? &gt;I must now speak to a framing issue. To frame this issue as between carnivores and herbivores is to miss a crucial evolutionary point: we are all omnivores. Just as we are all diurnal, we may choose to work the night shift; even if we choose to do so, however, it does not change our diurnal nature. &gt;This discussion arises from the problem of a comfortable society. Edward R. Murrow aptly described our society as “wealthy, fat, comfortable, and complacent.” I think this descriptor shines light on the present artificial controversy. That is, the artificial position against meat is an emergent property of an opulent society; take away our opulence and watch vegans eat pork, dog, horse, anything to survive. &gt;The last issue necessary to prove that it is ethically permissible to eat meat is defining “humane.” Humane treatment of animals explicates how the person treats the animal and why; whereas inflicting pain and death upon an animal for purposes of fulfilling a dietary need is ethical, doing so for the ends of entertainment, is not. &gt;We omnivores can feel familial with our cats while at the same time fattening up a goose for foie gras. Acting humane is a product of one’s ends. &gt;It is ethical to eat meat because it is impossible to demonstrate an ethical principle against clean, efficient, and humane abattoirs. It is not enough to assert a feeling, one must assert and hold a principle – in this debate, only omnivores can do that."

That said, eating vegetarian and vegan is clearly the better option, for society, for the environment, and for farmers. Lets not even talk about morality, let's talk about facts. What many people forget when they talk about factory farms is that animals have to be fed. A lot. In fact *over half* ([I found a biased source on my phone but I've read this elsewhere](http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/03/04/eating-meat-destruction-of-environment/)) of grains grown in the US are fed to factory farm animals. This is just grain, consider corn, soy, and grass that these animals also eat. Now when you think about that, you realize that factory farm animals compounds the problem that veganism removes. If everyone were to simultaneously become vegan, thousands of acres of land that were previously used to feed farm and house farm animals would be freed up. The whole argument that clearing land for food kills ecosystems is 100% true, but many of these acres cleared are *for* farm animals, so really you're arguing against yourself here.

CMV: I believe an ethical vegetarian or vegan diet is morally indefensible and delusional.,divinesleeper,0,"Basically you're making two arguments, as I see it. 1. Even when vegetarian, animals are killed for your vegetables. 2. There are billions of sentient creatures who die in nature. You cannot change this system. The fact that you think these two statements refute ethical vegetarianism, show you don't really understand it, which is why I will get some strawman arguments out of the way. First of all, let it be clear that not all animals are equally relatable for me. I care more about a pig, than I do about a fly. To pretend we should care equally for all living creatures (in line with the """"plants live too!"""" argument) is what *I* would call delusional. If you see someone chopping a tree, or swatting a fly, or shooting a dog, it is obvious that you are going to be more outraged at the latter. Empathy relies on how relatable the being is. Secondly, it is not merely the (untimely) killing that disgusts me. It is the putting of animals in small kernels, the genetic modifications and hormones that makes them into blocks of meat that can barely stand, let alone function the way they should in nature. To sustain humanity's market for meat, the meat industry, especially in the US, has turned some specific animals into little more than products. Now we have that out of the way, allow me to address your arguments. 1. I'm going to need more than your word here that animals are unavoidably killed for my vegetables. I don't see the direct relation. (and even then, I might not care, see 2.) However, I do know cruelty is to some extent unavoidable for large-scale meat production, because it requires us to limit the freedom of those animals. If we allowed them their freedom and lived from hunt, they would go extinct. In fact, these days it's not even possible to discuss the freedom of certain farm animals, because we have taken away their *capability* for freedom. Release battery chickens into the wild and they would just die. Which brings me to point 2. 2. Yes, of course billions of sentient beings die. And naturally, I care more about the deaths of certain beings above those of others. But I care a lot more about their lives, than I do about their deaths. Death is a part of nature, we should all learn to deal with it. What we do to farm animals, is not. To imply the goal of vegetarians is only to prevent *the death* of farm animals is absurd, because it suggests our goal is those animal's immortality or something. And just because death is unavoidable, doesn't mean I have to like helping distribute it!

Suppose, first, that they are maximally sensitive, or sensitive to differences of one: for every chicken consumed this year, there will be one additional chicken grown next year. If so, then my decision not to eat chicken is fully rational: it is guaranteed to reduce the suffering of twenty chickens at very little cost. Or rather, for economic reasons, other people might eat more chicken if I eat less, so let’s say instead that I would reduce the suffering of ten chickens at very little cost. Next, suppose that the meat industry is sensitive only to differences of 10,000: it will increase next year’s supply only when the number of chickens consumed this year reaches a multiple of 10,000. So, for example, when the millionth chicken is sold this year, this will ensure greater production next year, because 1,000,000 is a multiple of 10,000. However, the sale of additional chickens won’t affect production until one million and ten thousand chickens are sold. Now the question is whether my chicken boycott will determine whether some multiple of 10,000 is reached. If so, then the odds of my boycott mattering are merely 10 in 10,000, or 1 in 1,000. However, when a multiple of 10,000 is reached, the industry will increase production by 10,000. So, I now have a 1 in 1,000 chance of eliminating the suffering of 10,000 chickens, rather than a 1 in 1 chance of eliminating the suffering of 10 chickens. Each action has the same expected utility; both are fully rational. Finally, assume that the industry is sensitive only to multiples of 100,000. Now the odds of my boycott mattering dip down to 10 in 100,000, or 1 in 10,000. However, the payoff would be a world in which 100,000 fewer chickens suffer. Again, my action would be fully rational. &gt;This analysis is oversimplified. For example, it ignores the possible effects of government subsidies. But the basic idea is compelling: if the odds of success are high, then the payoff is high enough to justify boycotting meat; and if the odds of success are low, then the payoff is proportionally greater, and again the boycott is morally correct."

I also know a few who seem to do it because they like being smug assholes (and that seems to work for them as well). None of those reasons depend on how industry reacts, and all of them are valid reasons to make a choice. If a person wants to achieve a goal, and doing a thing helps them achieve that goal, then the action is not meaningless."

Meat doesn't grow on trees (unfortunately). It's an incredibly labour intensive, resource heavy process that requires feed crops to be grown, pharmaceuticals be administered, housing be built and maintained, and animals be slaughtered and butchered.

On an individual level, it's true that a single person can't change the industry much but as a movement, vegetarians and vegans have been really successful. Plant-based meat alternatives are being developed at a record high and they aren't just marketed to vegetarians. Flexitarianism (actively reducing meat consumption) has become a real thing and it wouldnt have been without vegetarians and vegans demanding meat alternative products. Meat replacers used to be really lousy, they've improved dramatically because they've had a market to work with. Meat producers are noticing too. Tyson (one of Americas largest chicken growers) recently bought a 5% stake in Beyond Meat, a meat alternative company. Many meat companies are looking at ways to diversify because of a slowing market. Vegetarians probably won't cause everyone to stop eating meat, but they've had helped create markets and growth for alternatives (in meat mostly, dairy alternatives are still fairly lousy because cheese is very complicated). Meat eaters are taking notice and have access to better products because of vegetarians."

They generally view religion as an institution that restricts a person's choices based on arbitrary definitions of good and evil as contrived by the movement's predecessors. These words, though not verbatim, reflect their beliefs pretty accurately. To me, to limit one's diet based on personal beliefs on the ethics and morals of meat consumption being wrong or not seems similar to the way we force religion upon our progeny.

Of course, excluding the obviously risky diet decisions (such as """"But daddy, I want cake EVERY DAY, for EVERY meal!).

CMV: I don't believe that it's right to force a vegan diet upon my future children,Zieb86,0,"Do you believe it would be okay for a white parent to force their child to not spend time with a black child because, simply put, the parent is racist? Now the parent may have a litany of reasons for their racism, but at the end of the day their reasons amount to them being racist than actually holding a logically sound argument against black people. I believe you would not find that okay, because you most likely find racism wrong. If you are racist then feel free to stop reading. Now compare racism to speciesism. I will argue that the primary moral reason for veganism is based on speciesism. Speciesism is the idea of giving special consideration to individuals based solely on their species. An example would be forbidding people from eating dogs, but able to eat pigs, even though the morally salient features of being a dog or pig are the same, e.g. both can suffer, both have emotions, both have preferences etc... It is thus an arbitrary distinction between the two just like when a racist values say white people over black people. Therefore, speciesism is analogous to racism just like racism is analogous to sexism. They are all arbitrary distinctions between individuals that I believe we will all agree are wrong. If you have no logical basis for the distinction then it should not exist. Black people should be equal to white people, men should be equal to woman, and simply being a species different from another species on it's own should not warrant different treatment. Now how is speciesism relevant to veganism? Well simply being a non-human species should not be a reason on it's own to justify suffering different treatment than humans receive. Thus, when deciding whether it is okay to kill or use something as a means to end, necessitates some kind of moral notion. One reason to not harm humans is because we are capable of suffering. If that is enough reason to not harm humans then the same must also apply to non-human animals if they are also capable of suffering. Simply being a different species than humans is not a morally salient reason in the same way being racist or sexist isn't a morally salient reason to treat black people or women differently than white people or men. Coming full circle, if you admit that racism is the same as speciesism, that not being a speciesist would cause you to be vegan, that you ought to raise your child to not be racist, then you ought to raise your child to not be speciesist by raising them vegan. Therefore, it would be your moral duty to raise your kid vegan, thus it is right to force a vegan diet upon your future children. Now you have other concerns about your child fitting in while growing up. Sadly, moral duties tend to naturally restrict the way in which we live our lives. We must at times give up things and not be privy to certain wonders of the world. Like murder, rape, slavery, missing out on delicious meat lovers pizzas after your team wins the football game. However, some of your problems as others have pointed out are solvable. Pack them vegan food that is similar and so forth. One of the benefits you may come to find also is that your children will be more thoughtful at an earlier age. They will understand ethical decisions more profoundly than most kids because you would have to explain to your children overtime why you do not allow them to eat meat. I hope this will change your view or at least illuminate the issue a bit more for you as to why you wife is advocating to raise the children vegan."
CMV: I don't believe that it's right to force a vegan diet upon my future children,bxtk,0,"The difficulty is drawing a line between influencing and indoctrinating, and because of this, your views are not necessarily in conflict from a moral standpoint. Logistics, as you argue, may be difficult at times, but that is the cost of a non-majority view with such tangible effects on lifestyle. Clearly, a person cannot allow their children to do something they see as immoral: you are responsible for the actions of your children, as they cannot yet make educated decisions about the situation. If your wife believes it is immoral and you believe it is amoral at best and at worst, it is immoral but unaffected by your personal actions (this I gather from reading your other replies, correct me if I am wrong), then it is morally indefensible to, in good conscience, allow your children to do it. That being said, you can do that without indoctrinating them against non-vegan diets. It would be necessary to explain that other views exist, and that such a view was simply not the one that you had. --- As they develop, children will become morally responsible. Kohlberg divides this moral development into six stages, only the final of which broaches the field of ethics: 1. **Obedience/punishment:** """"It's only illegal if you get caught"""" 1. **Instrumental relativism:** If an action is instrumental in bringing net tangible benefit to one's self or loved ones, it is okay. 1. **Good boy/Nice girl:** An action is acceptable if it is viewed positively by one's loved ones 1. **Law and order:** An action is acceptable if it is deemed to be by society at large (i.e., law) 1. **Social Contract:** An action is acceptable if it is right according to *Law and order* (stage 4), or if it is a wrong done against an equal wrong 1. **Universal ethics principle:** This is based upon the field of ethics, usually basing its rules on Kantian moral theory and/or utilitarianism (i.e., net cost/benefit to society). As a child broaches the 6th phase of moral development, and becomes capable of making their decision, they should become responsible for comparing the ethics of each view and deciding on one for themselves. It is at this point, and only at this point, that your wife's moral views on meat-eating would come into direct conflict with your moral views on indoctrination. One or both of you would have to compromise your standpoint in order to proceed from that point. While it is not the question you ask, my suggestion (as someone who does not have children and is not a formally-trained psychologist beyond a psych101 class) would be to approach it passively. Your wife cannot, with ethical integrity in tact, *enable* the child to do something immoral. You cannot, with ethical integrity in tact, *disable* the child from doing something defined as right by moral principle they have developed from the information available to them. Both conditions would be satisfied by allowing them to partake in the activity in situations where your resources do not contribute [i.e., in social settings or (when they were old enough to do so) by preparing their own meals]."

You can pretty much guarantee that there will be at least a few other kids in your kid's class and social groups that will have to have their own 'special' foods.

Having said this, I think there is another reason why you're uncomfortable with the idea of raising your kids vegan, and you're not talking about it here. I think that you are imagining a future where your wife and kids are all vegan and you're not. Your wife sees eating meat as morally wrong, and so do your kids.

CMV: I don't believe that it's right to force a vegan diet upon my future children,ReallyNicole,0,"OK, let's try this. I think we can all agree that if something is morally wrong, it's right for you to force your kids not to do it (if they're inclined to do it). So if your kid is about to murder somebody, the right thing for you to do would be stop the murder, even if that would require force on your part. Likewise, we can also agree that if something *isn't* morally or prudentially wrong, it's generally not OK to force your children not to do it. The issue here, then, is whether or not eating meat and other animal products is morally wrong. So instead of asking whether or not it's right to force a vegan diet on children, it seems like you want to be asking whether or not veganism is morally required of us. With an answer to this question, it seems like the answer to your question in the OP is easy as butterless pie. Now you have this kid-specific worry that a vegan kid would miss out on tons of great kid stuff. However, I don't think this helps you in light of my point. I mean, we can imagine a time when kids got to go see accused witches burn at the stake and we can imagine that this was generally a popular activity that kids loved. So when a couple is arguing about whether or not it's right to burn witches at the stake, is """"well if we don't endorse this, then our kids will grow up without having seen a witch burn,"""" a good point to make? No, obviously not. Maybe an even better example would be children of families who could have owned slaves. Maybe one member of the family thinks that slavery is wrong and so wants to have nothing to do with it. Just like above, that your kids will miss out on being taken care of by slaves is not a good reason to against forcing them into a life without slaves."

You can overcome most all of this fairly easily with nothing more or less than ingenuity and forethought. Your child doesn't need to be excluded if you provide food and assist in planning events. You'd be surprised how willing people are to accommodate if you are willing to supply the extra work yourself. There's a different problem with putting your child on a different diet than the parents. The kid will notice that his or her mom isn't eating the same food. The kids will want to know why they aren't """"allowed"""" to eat the other diet without the capacity to understand up front. This is very likely to cause problems by """"othering"""" the kids in their own minds. A healthy family needs a healthy dynamic, and not eating the same food is a barrier to be overcome. Look, your children will not be able to speak for themselves on the issue. Until then you will need to speak for them, and they will need to feel that they are with you until such time as they feel that they can start making decisions for themselves. You are really going to have to talk to your girlfriend no matter what. Raising children as vegans is a challenge, but it's not implausible that it can be pulled off.

People here have brought forth the argument that if you believe that eating meat/animal products is animal cruelty, then you shouldn't let your children practice animal cruelty. You dismiss it because to you it either isn't animal cruelty, or you think it is cruelty but that it doesn't matter (I am a little unclear on your beliefs). What you are missing, though, is it matters what your girlfriend believes. If she thinks that eating animals/animal products is animal cruelty, then it makes sense that she wouldn't allow her children to participate in eating animals/animal products.

Personally, I come from a family with a similar situation, and compromises are possible. My mom is kosher and my dad isn't. They decided that they would keep a kosher home, but that we could eat what we wanted outside of the house. Meanwhile I was exposed to why my mom was kosher and what it meant to her, with the firm understanding that I could come to my own conclusions. My sister and I became kosher sometime in middle school, and my brother still eats treif. But this compromise was acceptable because it was something that my mom was okay with. If she was more observant and believed that being kosher was a necessity, this compromise wouldn't have been something that worked. It would have been disrespectful for my father to insist that she go against her beliefs (although if she were that religious, my dad probably wouldn't have been a good match for her)."

I do believe keeping them on a healthy path is quite OK though. Don't allow them to eat fast food and drink sodas regularly. Watch the crazy sugar intake and other unnecessary garbage.

For example, my youngest sister is ethically opposed to eating meat because she dislikes that animals have to be harmed (even if killed humanely). So she is a vegetarian.

You don't really care, morally speaking, if the kid eats meat or not; she does. I figure that means she won't really be willing to budge on it, and even if she does, it could cause resentment. You have to weigh those things against the possibility that your kid will be the weird one in school, and be picked on because of his diet. Idk how probable these things are in your area, nor do i know your specific set of values, but all in all, I say raise him vegan if you love her. She'll appreciate it, and the kid will have to learn to deal with bullies at some point anyway, so no real harm there. Just so you know, I am a vehement meat eater.

That means waking up early to prepare a lunch for the child every single day instead of letting the school take care of it. You don't have to take part of it. That being said, I would argue prepared meals would be better than letting your kid eat whatever he or she wanted.

CMV: Diets that include meat are superior to a vegetarian diet,pizzacourier,0,Meats may deliver proteins more effectively to the body but they also deliver an excess of cholesterol and sodium. On the other hand a legume based protein source may be less effective than meats but will also deliver an abundance of other vitamins and nutrients. The key to a diet is achieving your daily recommendations without exceeding your limits. So it sounds like your argument is really that meat is a better protein source than vegetables and not necessarily a better diet.
CMV: Diets that include meat are superior to a vegetarian diet,king2ndthe3rd,0,"Almost everything you said is false. Vegetarian diets have less of an impact on the environment than a meat eater's diet. Think about it, farming livestock takes huge amounts of land, an immense amount of water, not to mention the methane pollution they produce and the rampant cruelty of modern meat farming practices. Organic meat that was killed cleanly, grass fed and had a half decent life costs way more than your average meat. Not having meat in your diet can be a prudent and rewarding decision in your life. Studies now show that red meat causes cancer. Of course, everything in moderation right? Well, the average american eats way more meat than they are supposed to- a steak is 2 times greater than the recommended daily average. Vegetarian diets can be very fulfilling and satisfying when done right- and they certainly don't lack protein. It is more than possible to have enough of every nutrient in your body without meat, you just have to know what foods are truly good for you."
CMV: Diets that include meat are superior to a vegetarian diet,minerva_qw,1,"It's funny you should cite T. Colin Campbell. In the [very article](http://nutritionstudies.org/animal-vs-plant-protein/) you cite, Campbell goes on to say: &gt;Plant proteins are somewhat compromised by their limitation of one or more amino acids. When we restore the relatively deficient amino acid in a plant protein, we get a response rate equivalent to animal proteins. And then: &gt;I don’t especially like dwelling on the finer structural and functional characteristics of animal and plant proteins as being of great importance. His research draws very different conclusions than what you seem to be suggesting. For example: &gt;It is not that animal protein cannot be utilized for good effect, especially when nothing else may be available, or that this nutrient does not build muscle mass. It does. But so does plant protein. And it does so with superior results. ([Source](http://nutritionstudies.org/muscling-meat-myth/)) &gt;Although preceded by several reports on the association of dietary fat with cancers in the 1960s and 1970s among different countries, a 1986 report showed that the almost linear increased cancer rates often observed with high fat diets are primarily attributed to animal-based food (total dietary fat and animal-based protein are highly correlated, that is, &gt;90%). ([Source](http://nutritionstudies.org/mystique-of-protein-implications/)) And the consensus among major world health organizations ([1](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx) [2](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx) [3](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition) [4](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/) [5](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html) [6](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf) [7](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446) [8](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm))is that plant-based diets are at least as healthy as those containing animal products, and may even confer some additional health benefits. See [this statement](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864) from the American Dietetic Association: &gt;appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes. As for some of your other points: &gt;Environmentally speaking, vegetarian diets are not necessarily better for the environment than non-vegetarian, because I can argue that a vegetarian diet causes an increase in the use of weed-killing herbicides which are toxic to plants and fish. The vast majority of plants are grown to feed livestock. ([Source](http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat)) &gt;I think that the moral argument against eating meat is false and unfounded, not to mention the fallacy of elevating animal life over plant life. Most people would agree that it's wrong to cause unnecessary suffering. As established above, consuming animal products is unnecessary. Plants do not have central nervous systems and cannot experience pain, fear, or suffering. Animals can experience these sensations, and our use of them as commodities causes them harm. If we can prevent this, isn't that the more moral course? &gt;Every animal will eventually die or be killed; it is natural to kill for food. There are a lot of things that are """"natural."""" That has no bearing on whether or not they are moral. For example, incest, infanticide, rape and cannibalism occur frequently in nature. &gt;What is not ethical, however, is torturing animals before they die, or giving them a slow death. [99% of farm animals](https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/factory-farms) raised in the US come from factory farms. And labels like """"humane"""" and """"free range"""" have[ very little bearing](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2010/12/why-free-range-meat-isnt-much-better-than-factory-farmed/67569/) on how animals are actually treated. &gt;Again, that can be solved by finding ways to kill them without feeling pain. Right now, raising and killing animals for food causes them to suffer. Just because there could hypothetically be a way to kill beings painlessly doesn't justify doing it now."
CMV: Animal cruelty is insignificant,thekonzo,0,"I am not gonna read all of this, but i will just list my points. Animals consciously experience life just like we do, even if they dont reflect on their experience or have thoughts going on. Their ability to feel joy or suffering is the same we have. We healthy humans have empathy that causes us to feel the pain in other humans and to care about baby animals and care about things we relate to. You might be desensitized towards animals suffering. Its the same thing that allowed nazis to see jews as dirt or slave owners to treat blacks the way they did. We humans are capable of suppressing empathy. As healthy kids however we were all pretty much sensitive to suffering of others, even though empathy skills for young kids are underdeveloped in some respect. It is true that we in theory should feel more empathy towards our own kind for mating and tribe reasons, but that does not mean that empathy towards other beings is """"wrong"""". nature has no plan. we see parts of ourselves in other animals and we empathy with them because we can profit from a relationship. You only seem to care about some sort of biological empathy and disregard the conscious empathy of knowing another being is exactly like yourself. Yes we do treat animals horribly on mass for our own gain and yes animals suffer in the wild too and scientists widely dont like interfering with that """"way of nature"""". To a degree we however depend on it and try to keep the suffering to a minimum. We dont want to """"fix nature"""" because we dont fully understand it yet and should observe. Yes at some point when we dont depend on animals for our consumption anymore we will prioritize the reduction of suffering and preservation of species, so we would tone it all down and only breed them for zoos and preserving nature. You dont have to fully supress all empathy for animals even if you kill and consume them. You can try to have it be a compromise, give them a good experience in life, one that they otherwise wouldnt have in the first place, and then do the killing respectfully and thankful. Circle of Life and stuff. You mention aliens as an example and they being in their right to dominate and kill us. Well, not necessarily. If they have their reasons then they have their reasons. If they dont care about other conscious beings then thats how they work. That does not mean that they are superior to us. Its very possible to coexist with beings of other races and species and worlds even in peace at the same time. Of course for that we would need to cut back on humanities numbers/breeding at some point, thats gonna happen in some way anyways. When we dont need animal meat anymore we will have no reason to kill them anymore, this is why we look down on women in fur, on the hunt for elephant ivory. We have no real need for those things, so causing animal suffering is not worth it."
CMV: Animal cruelty is insignificant,fionasapphire,0,"&gt;They are not human beings, they are not one of your own. How far does this extend? Why species? Why not, """"They're not the same race as me, why should I care?"""" or """"They're not in my family, why should I care?"""" or even, """"They're not _me_, why should I care?"""" True compassion means you don't want _any_ living being to suffer. True compassion doesn't set arbitrary boundaries."
CMV: Animal cruelty is insignificant,therapy,0,"Let me try to change your view with a few reasons why I think you should care about animal cruelty: * It a known fact that sociopaths often start by [being cruel to animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macdonald_triad#Cruelty_to_animals). Which makes sense: Animals are close enough to humans for sociopaths to get some of the satisfaction they want - to be able to control a living being that tries to get away but can't, to see it suffer at their hands, to see the life go out of its eyes as they kill it. And there are plenty of weak animals that can be abused and killed, and you don't go to jail for it. The argument is then, to protect humans, we should protect animals: If someone likes torturing and killing animals, that's someone law enforcement should be aware of. * A related argument is """"societies are judged by how they treat their weakest members."""" The reasoning there is that if a society lets the disabled, the elderly, minorities of all sorts, etc., or any other vulnerable group be abused then it isn't a just society. And we should care about that because we will all be elderly eventually, we might all become disabled, or be poor, and so forth. But even if we couldn't become one of those groups, we should still protect them all - encourage kindness to everyone, which helps ensure we are all treated kindly in turn. Animals are just another such group that is vulnerable and deserves protection, and that by protecting it we help keep society kind. * On a totally different angle: have you ever had a pet? For most people, the issue of animal cruelty comes down to them loving of having loved an animal, and understanding through that that animals can feel pain and joy and love and other emotions in a similar way to how humans can. This isn't really a rational argument, of course, but """"we aren't the same species"""", as you put it, isn't rational either - there is no reason to stop our empathy at the limit of our species. For example, once the limit might have been limited to our race or ethnic group, for example - those limits change. The philosopher [Peter Singer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer#Animal_liberation_and_veganism) has argued that that is in fact how human morality has progressed, by """"expanding the circle"""" - from our close family, to caring about our tribe, to caring about larger and larger groups, more and more different from us. Including animals is just another step there."
CMV: Animal cruelty is insignificant,UrbanZenMonk,0,"You replied elsewhere about a dog being hit, I'm replying as main comment. They aren't alien to us, dogs, for instance, have genetics derived from how we've bred them. We bred them for protection, hunting, etc. They provided services. They understand us pointing, when our eyes look at something they can put 2 and 2 together regarding that. Not many other species can follow our instructions so easily. Why wouldn't you care about things that have helped us? These dogs have not only sounded the alarm at intruders, but have helped protect our livestock. Do you trash your own car at the end of the day and say """"wtf do I care? It's an object?"""" Probably not. I'm confident you have attachments to such things (or else you're a decent monk free from attachment). I'm sure if your car broke down or something you'd care (maybe because of money) but let's say someone scratched it, you may get upset but why? It's just paint. It has no function other than coloring the car. Same for horses. They provided a service. Shooting them and beating them would be like attacking your tractor (horses used to be used to plow) or beating your car up, again, as per the travel bit. And, why is one beating an animal in the first place? That's not normal behavior even for most animals, to waste energy beating something up you've no intention on eating. It's just a huge waste of resources and only stems from anger, hatred, or even boredom, none of which are positive things (generally, speaking). An alligator has a primitive mind incapable of understanding it's suffering. Don't forget, it's subject to the very same attacks it dishes out but it cannot comprehend the logic of """"do unto others to which you want done unto yourself."""" Humans can. One thing we have is self awareness. Not only the ability to look in a mirror and know it's us, but the fact that if we commit an action, we have the ability to predict it's outcome. We worry of the future and dwell on the past. It's wisdom. Beating something up over nothing and thinking nothing of it because it's a different specie isn't very wise. Just a waste of time at the very best."

Generally speaking, most moral systems think reducing suffering is good. You can make an argument about if animal testing outweighs suffering by humans, etc, but it gets harder to justify using animals unethically the closer they get to humans. Either way, most people view suffering as something to reduce, and no point in meaningless cruelty."

CMV: Animal cruelty is insignificant,Rashek4,0,"When discussing moral values you always have to keep one thing in mind: Moral values are arbitrary and relative. They only came to be because of how we evolved, not for any grand philosophical reason. And for different people they are different. If you question people enough the reason why they value things it always boils down to arbitrary emotions in the end. You for example mentioned you think preserving our ecosystem is important. Why? Probably because it's good for us humans. Why do you think humans having a good time is important? If you continue this line of why-questions long enough you'll inevitably reach an answer based on emotions. So in a way you are right that caring about animals is pointless and arbitrary. But on close examination caring about anything is pointless and arbitrary. A practical tip for these awkward conversations: It's best to initially ask about base moral values. If these are very different you'll never end up convincing anybody of your opinion nor will you ever be convinced by their opinion."
CMV: Animal cruelty is insignificant,TheChemist158,0,"&gt;And that’s the main focus of my argument: what separates us from the dumb animals we see every day is our rationality. Killing humans is wrong, you admit that. Killing a weed in my yard is fine, I admit that. So I think that the question is where to draw the line, and what defining feature(s) to consider. You state that it is rationality, which I assume means the ability to have rational thought. But I'm not sure why you draw the line there. I'd like to hear a better rationale (pun completely intended!) for that. In the meantime, I'd also like to propose an alternative; ability to feel pain. The neural network that we have allows for rational thought, emotions, self and environmental awareness, and pain. In terms of what we consider right and wrong to do to each other, we focus a lot on if we inflicted pain, either physical or emotional. We generally say the severity of our hurtful actions scale with the pain inflicted, not the rationality of the victim. In fact, we often consider harming children (distinctly less capable of rational thought) as worse than harming adults, though I'd like to confirm if you agree with this. Shoving a person down who twists their ankle is considered bad because I hurt them. Even if it was accidently, it would still be called a unfortunate accident because pain came from it. If I broke a person's leg, it would be considered worse because the pain was worse. We dislike pain, and we understand that inflicting pain in others is just as bad as others inflicting pain is us. Now, a plant doesn't feel pain. It doesn't have the same neural network and central nervous system that allows of sensory input and processing. These things evolved in animals. And different creatures in the animalia kingdom and different nervous system, some of which are very similar to our own. It's always hard to say just what a dog or cow """"feels"""" or how similar those feelings are to our own. But compared to rocks, weeds, and bugs, they have a similar nervous system to us. And they do seem to feel at least similar feelings of physical pain, along with some emotional pain. And I don't see why that pain and suffering is all that different from the pain and suffering in humans that we focus so much on."
CMV: Animal cruelty is insignificant,clockworkgirl21,0,"Not caring about the suffering of another creature is something animals do because they run mostly on instinct and their own basic needs. I once saw a lion eating a buffalo alive that was stuck in the mud. And why not? It was stuck in one place and the lion needed to eat. Why should the lion be concerned about the level of pain it was in? Now, most animals will cause suffering and not give a shit to another species. Take my lion and buffalo example. However, they look at members of their group differently. Wolves will take meat back to other wolves too sick to be included in the kill. Mongooses will stand guard to protect their family while those family members eat. Bonobos will give aid to injured group members. You're basically operating on the same logic. I'm getting what I need and don't care about you, so why would I care about the suffering I am causing you? You aren't a member of my group, so fuck you. Only members of my group get my empathy. If we aren't even operating on a higher level of empathy than animals, are we even that superior? If everyone was like you we'd be working on nothing more complex than an animal's own world view and that hardly makes us greater than they are. Isn't the point of our humanity that we can get past primal urges like that and think bigger? If you can't, congrats. You're as basic as the lion not giving a shit about the buffalo howling in pain. Those of us that do care have achieved greater, like humans are supposed to strive for."
CMV: Animal cruelty is insignificant,slater8r,0,"I think what you're doing is setting up an In Group, and an Out Group. You're according massive rights to the In Group - where you're happy with untold suffering and wanton destruction meeted out to the Out Group. You're not making these groups with any particular rationale in mind - you say it's along the lines of """"species"""" though you seem to have no particular motive to investigate this aspect because you say you're not """"well-versed"""" in biology. The furthest you go into this motivation is that we're """"rational beings"""". And so your justification for an indifference (sometimes tipping over into what seems to me a relish for) massive suffering, rests on a part of science that you're not """"well-versed"""" in; and an argument that's pretty irrational, while claiming that the basis for this grouping is rationality! Kinda ironic no? In truth, I think you have nothing to help you in this justification except your own feelings. I think your argument is basically thought up after the event. And for my money, that event is a huge existential fear! Now let me justify myself, in such a bold claim! Why would you go to such great lengths to elevate yourself over other animals if you didn't feel the need to contradict a feeling of inferiority? Why would you be indifferent to other animal's suffering, if you weren't scared by the prospect of your own? Why would you justify another animal's suffering, with an argument that just happens to rules out your own? I came to this conclusion before reading that you as a kid """"HAD to behead, slice and pluck the feathers out of chickens"""" (my emphasis). You """"felt nothing doing so"""" because you, in your mind, made them inferior to you. As a little kid, you must have asked """"if this can happen to them, can it also happen to me?"""" and you can understand a little kid replying """"It can't happen to me, because I'm different."""" That left the small problem of finding why you were different, and you happened upon the idea that you (and most other people) are a) people and b) rational. Now that you try to justify this reasoning as an adult, it's rather threadbare, you will probably admit? The problem with it, isn't that it's a bad argument, but that it's purpose was to console a child. It was never about being a good argument, but about being something you could believe in. It's probably reinforced every time you take a bite of chicken. """"This roast chicken proves that I'm worthy; that this can't happen to me; that I have nothing to worry about."""" But you're also faced with the dilemma of trying to figure out a response to the existential fears that we all have, and knowing deep down, that this argument is a road block to that. You know it doesn't make sense, but you feel that you can't shed it without becoming mortal, without opening yourself up to the untold pain and suffering that you've seen first hand. I feel that the answer to my, your and all of our existential angst is not to somehow become superior - because that's not true of any of us. The answer is to rejoice in my, your and all of our lives - whether we be flies, chickens, sheep or people, because only by viewing life as precious, can your own be seen as that. After all, there are not gradations of life. You either have it or you don't. And if life is cheap, then so is yours."
CMV: Animal cruelty is insignificant,LejendarySadist,0,"I doesn't feel like you ever present an actual argument for why animals are insignificant. You kind of assume it, maybe because you have a large bias for humans. You seem to hold the position that harming humans is an inherently unjust act and to do so would need justification, but harming an animal doesn't need any such justification. If so, why? What trait do animals lack that justifies this difference in treatment that if were absent in humans would justify the same treatment to humans? The reason you won't be able to find a trait is because your argument is based on the premise that animals have no value, with no actual justification behind said premise. You state they are less rational, which is true, but there are plenty of humans that are irrational as well. Does that mean that killing or abusing those humans doesn't need justification? Or do you just discriminate against animals on the sole basis that they aren't humans, and try to mask that with weak """"justifications"""" such as that they are less rational, or dumber?"
CMV: Animal cruelty is insignificant,irishsurfer22,0,"Clarying question: Where do you think morality comes from? You mention that you think we should care about humans because we're the same species, but I don't really follow the logic there. I think morality comes from trying to maximize the well-being and minimize the suffering of conscious creatures; the amount we care should about a particular creature should scale with the creature's capacity for conscious experience (good or bad). So naturally, we care more about a human life than an ant. Additionally, we care more about a dog than a jellyfish."
CMV: Animal cruelty is insignificant,SordidDreams,0,"&gt;even from a logical perspective, assuming that those aliens were only merely smarter than us, they wouldn’t have the right to rule over us and do with us what they please. They would only have that right if those aliens possessed something that we humans lack that makes them inherently superior. Like, say, greater intelligence? Anyway, if you want to know why animal cruelty is bad, get a puppy and torture it. Burn it, flay it, break its bones, rip its guts out. If you feel nothing, if you're entirely okay with doing that yourself, then congratulations, your view is internally consistent. You're also a psychopath, but at least you're consistent. If torturing a puppy is not something you're willing to do yourself, your entire post basically boils down to """"I'm okay with it because it's happening out of my sight"""".

Which is reasonable, not paying taxes has huge consequences for you, would also defund your share of welfare, roads and things you probably feel you should pay your part of --- and is a horribly ineffective means to stop the cruelty metted out by the government. &gt; The clothes I wear were made in a sweatshop, the fruits and vegetables I eat were picked by illegal immigrants, my phone and computer contain metals that people died to secure Doing one thing wrong is absolutely never a justification for doing other things wrong. Also, you could work on making some of these things better. However human issues are never as simple except in the extreme cases. Is it better than undocumented immigrants don't have jobs or that they have shitty, exploitive jobs. Neither is ok! We need to support immigrant rights! It's harder to know how to put that in practice in the super market, but that's not a reason to give up on being a moral person when you do know what to do. We just need to be vocal about human suffering and support groups addressing those issues as well. &gt; When I do cook (I mostly make soups or chilis, with rice), it takes a lot of time, and it doesn't taste all that great. Make bigger batches. If you eat a lot and don't have time, cook big batches in the beginning of the week. Do you not like soups and chilis or is the issue that you aren't mimicking chilis you do like well? In the latter case, I think some better recipes could help. /r/veganrecipes are good places for recipes :-). Knowing a little more about your budget, your preferences and your goals (and what is available where you live!), /r/vegan is a great source of support and people there will often help you plan out something you actually want to eat. &gt; I do strength training, but I have trouble getting the amount of protein that fitness forums recommend. No, problem - have you heard of [Patrik Baboumian?](http://www.greatveganathletes.com/vegan_athlete_patrik-baboumian-vegan-strongman). You might be more at ease if you take your advice from vegan fitness forums: * /r/veganfitness * http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/weightlifting * http://breakingmuscle.com/nutrition/how-to-build-muscle-mass-on-a-plant-based-diet * http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/mahler53.htm * http://www.nomeatathlete.com/gain-weight-vegan/ &gt; When my friends invite me out to eat, I often can't eat anything. I am not a very social person, although I would like to be, and this has not helped. :-(. Usually calling the restaurant in advance can allow you to figure out some option, even if it's a little shitty. Very few restaurants can't finagle anything at all vegan. If your friends aren't complete assholes, it shouldn't ruin your friendships that you are just eating the french fries, or the vegetable sandwich with no cheese or mayo or a bowl of rice. (Pre-eat though.) Or suggests restaraunts which are friendlier! &gt; I am coming to believe that conformity has very real value, even if what we're adhering to was set arbitrarily, because we're social animals and we need to be around others. Not when there is injustice. Conforming to a culture of violence is wrong. And a culture of not questioning violence - whether it's towards humans (war crimes, abuse of undocumented people, other oppressed people) or animals. You are obviously aware of that, so be part of the change and speak out against all the forms of violence and oppression. Veganism is a statement that you are against violence towards animals and you are unwilling to be violent even when it's normal, and that should bolster non violence towards humans -- not conflict with it! But what's more is that veganism is another way to make friends. Find vegan groups, there might even be vegan weight lifters near you. They don't have to be your whole social life but it can help to talk to others who also see violence towards animals as violence, and who will be excited to share vegan meals. They will offer support and tips and might just help you feel happier when you are with your other friends. Being able to talk to people who understand your perspective even once in a while really can make everything better! :-)"
CMV:I should stop being a vegan,pet_medic,0,"Try meetup.com and look for local vegan or humanist groups. (From personal experience, an unusual percentage of humanists are vegan; in any case, you probably share a lot of values.) I've made so many good friends since moving to a new town and doing this-- I went from knowing absolutely nobody for a full year, to joining these groups, and within 3 months I'm now in a vegan band (I learned bass guitar just to play with them! I already played regular guitar so it was an easier learning curve), I have a weekly vegan meal with friends, I am in a book club, etc. Your mileage may vary-- I happen to be in a small conservative town that inexplicably has an amazing humanist group. Having that social structure eases all of your other concerns-- eating with others helps you learn to cook, and also it makes food prep fun. (I never cook for myself, but I can make myself put a recipe together to share with friends). It also helps you learn more easily what is and isn't vegan-- maybe you're putting too much effort into it. Fruits, nuts, lentils, rice, beans, cereal and soy milk, oreo cookies and potato chips are all fairly cheap and not that stressful to prepare. If you're not already a member of r/vegan, that's another great place to pick up recipes and pointers on what is/isn't vegan, and maybe even find a local vegan to hang out with. I think you're absolutely right that you have to pick and choose your cause-- we could all be doing more, we could all literally be saving lives right now with donations or volunteerism. But veganism is one of the absolute best things you can do for the environment, and it's one of the best things you can do for animals. I wouldn't criticize you for stopping if it's making your life miserable, but I hope I can encourage you to find happiness in veganism. Maybe you should visit a farm sanctuary or something, so you can get a concrete picture of what you're going for."

Towards slaugterhouses, I've just always felt that the animals there were born and bred to be food. They wouldn't have existed in the first place if there wasn't a need for food.

CMV:I should stop being a vegan,haggusmcgee,0,"Unless you are eating more than 3oz of read meat per day, according to the [NHS](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/red-meat.aspx) you are not increasing your risk of bowel cancer above normal levels. Everyone has a risk of cancer at all times, just from living. Don't be scared; if it happens to you are unlucky, but if you live healthily you will simply minimise the risks. Don't spend your life fretting about cancer risks. Despite the option of eating higher welfare meat to tackle your squeamish qualms of raising livestock (you destroying a nest isn't balanced by not eating eggs: you shouldn't feel bad about that incident), you should stay vegan because: 1. Growing meat and dairy markets are causing widespread deforestation of rainforests and other wild habitats. No matter how ethically we treat livestock, we should not sacrifice biodiversity to raise them. [20% of the Amazon has gone due to cattle ranching and palm oil at 4:1](http://www.cowspiracy.com/infographic). (Link: Ignore most of those points on climate change, water and waste, I don't buy their reasoning, but that's another discussion). 2. Fishing using trawlers and large nets is driving all kinds of marine life to extinction, and is extremely wasteful of life. That said, I think moderation is the best solution. You are right that the need/want line is arbitrary. However one can be conscious of which products they buy (free-range, not batch farmed, nor from fish farms). A small amount of meat as a treat every now and then is sufficiently ethical. Maybe once or twice a week, such as when with friends. I don't think one person's sacrifice to positively impact the environment is worth social isolation of said individual. And your point about other industries is true, you should not support slave labour etc.. If you do it by accident then you can't be blamed, but just keep your ears open when you buy a new phone or piece of clothing."
CMV:I should stop being a vegan,McKoijion,0,"It seems like you have some underlying issues here that changing your diet isn't necessarily going to fix. 1. If you can't cook well without meat, it's not like you are suddenly going to become better at it because you have a few more ingredients available. 2. If you are uncomfortable ordering a meal with friends because you are embarrassed by your diet, you aren't going to feel any better by simply conforming to their norms. Self-confidence and happiness has to come from within. It might be your diet today, but there will always be something else to change. 3. Your science is correct, but you have let your fear take over. [Dairy is associated with acne, but only weakly.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20338665) Next, [red meat consumption is linked to cancer,](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/red-meat-consumption-and-breast-cancer-risk/) but a lot of things cause cancer. Plus you can avoid a lot of the risk by eating it once a week instead of twice a day like most people. Vegans risk getting too little protein (although there are plenty of vegan Cross-Fit types that get plenty.) There are health risks with all types of foods. It is valuable to learn about them, and make rational decisions based on them, but not to let them control your life. Changing your diet isn't going to fix this neurosis. 4. You seem to have trouble with eating exciting foods regardless of your dietary habits. Variety is the spice of life, and it seems like you've been eating the same foods over and over again for too long. Try vegan foods from other countries like China, India, Italy, Thailand, Ethiopia, Mexico, etc. If your idea of vegan food is a soy burger or soup and rice all the time, no wonder you are sick of it. Unless you are going to burger places and fast food places all the time, it is really easy to order dishes without meat. Places like McDonalds have nothing for vegans, places like Chipotle or a local Vietnamese restaurant have lots of choices. Meat might fix your meals, but variety will definitely fix them. If you eat grilled chicken, white rice, and asparagus at every meal, you are going to hate eating meat too. In short, give up veganism if you want to, but don't expect it to fix all your problems. You are using it at a scapegoat for a host of underlying issues, and you'll probably feel much better if you self-assess, and work on those concerns instead. Good luck!"
CMV:I should stop being a vegan,[deleted],0,[deleted]
CMV:I should stop being a vegan,nectarine18,1,"Hi! I have been vegan for about the same time as you, and I found it staggeringly hard. I grew up in a family of five eating mostly cheap, processed foods, tons of meat and dairy, going out for McDonald’s at least once a week. I literally had no patience or desire to cook anything that didn’t come in a box. It took until very recently for me to be able to be comfortable with my cooking and eating habits, but I have to say that going vegan has been the most incredible joy of my life. I understand that you haven’t had the same experience, but I really do think it makes sense to stick with it — for both ethical and health reasons. I went vegan because I realized that if I was vegetarian for ethical reasons, I could not justify not being vegan. I take your point — there is suffering inherently involved in pretty much anything we do. I do not specifically seek out local or fair trade products, but I still think it’s important to abstain from consuming anything that comes from animals. All we can really do when it comes to reducing, or refusing to be involved in practices we consider cruel is what is practical and possible for us. For me to specifically locate fair-trade, local, etc. products would be a difficult task — I would have to change where I buy most everything, and find replacements for virtually all the products I buy or use. It is not a matter of being consistent, though. It is simply a matter of trying your very best. Being vegan, to me, is very much within the realm of what we can easily do, because all it constitutes is avoiding certain aisles at the grocery store. I understand that it does generally mean cooking for yourself a lot more, but if I have made the change, I’m pretty much certain anyone can. It also, to me, makes sense because it recognizes that the very basic capacity to feel pain and will to live — something all animals share — inherently makes a creature deserving of a life free from pain.. Those rights are so invaluable, human or not. They are the most basic rights we all naturally have. And all I have to do is spend 20-30 minutes cooking a couple times a day, or 10 minutes cutting up fruit in the morning. How could I justify not doing that, when it is that simple? I think what is important to recognize is that going vegan means changing your eating habits and attitude towards food every bit as much as it means changing what you eat. This is why I had trouble for so long, at least — but trust me that *changing* those things is all that’s hard, you just have to get over a hump. If you have time to order and wait for delivery, or go out to a restaurant to eat, you should have time to cook. There is a lot you can do to help yourself out — cut up vegetables and fruit in advance, or if you find you have time at some point, just make huge batches of things you can eat throughout the week. I keep like six jars of soup in my fridge. Try to find very simple recipes, if you can — there plenty out there — and just stick to your favourites. Curries, pastas, sandwiches and soups are all very easy to make. If you actually would personally like advice or recipes, you can PM me. Once you have figured out what works for you — and I am absolutely you will get there — your life should no more difficult than it is now. Try to develop a new attitude towards your food: because it is free from something that goes against your values, and also extremely healthy for you, it is nourishing you, both body and soul. And it is extremely healthy for you. I will admit that I know less about the health benefits of veganism than I do about the ethical ones, but I do know that there is a plethora of studies that link animal products to cancer, heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis and a number of other illnesses. I think it makes absolute sense when you think about it: we are primates; we share 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees. Of course our bodies want a diet that’s mostly fruits, veggies, nuts and seeds. All animal products contain cholesterol. Not one plant contains cholesterol. Cholesterol literally *only* does your body harm — no good. All plants are high in fibre, and not one animal contains any fibre. A really wide study (that I desperately tried to find, to no avail) just found that less than 3% of meat-eating Americans get the recommended *minimum* amount of fiber in a day: 97% of the population is deficient. This was a huge profile of vegetarians (i.e. vegans) vs. non-vegetarians documenting a wide range of nutrients … I am pretty sure it was by Dr. Michael Greger and I can absolutely track it down if you’d like. It additionally found that vegetarians, on average, got 70% more protein than they need every day (along with meat-eaters). I am surprised that you found you are not getting enough protein, even for an athlete — what tipped you off to that? Getting enough protein usually just means is eating enough food in a day — it is so abundantly available. Have you ever seen the film Forks Over Knives? It’s on Netflix, and is completely about the health aspects of vegan vs. non-vegan diets. It’s a really good watch if you can get it. I don’t know that a causal link has ever been established between meat and cancer, but I know that there are thousands upon *thousands* that demonstrate a definite connection. The same goes for both dairy and eggs. I believe that it has something to do with the fact that all animal products are acidic, and our bodies are alkaline. Acidic environments, I believe, are at a much higher risk of developing *and* of exacerbating cancer. Don’t quote me on that, though. I do know that vegans have consistently been shown to be at a very low risk. I’m sorry that this was so incredibly long, but I really wanted to address each of your points in depth. I hope you take them into consideration. It is so good, once you’re on the other side of the fence. P.S. Where the heck are your friends taking you that there are no options that can, at the very least, be modified to be vegan?!"

CMV:I should stop being a vegan,anarchography,0,"&gt; The clothes I wear were made in a sweatshop, the fruits and vegetables I eat were picked by illegal immigrants, my phone and computer contain metals that people died to secure, I implicitly support a government that bombs citizens in third-world countries, and so on. There's an important (at least in my opinion) distinction between the exploitation of non-human animals and that of humans. It's generally impossible to acquire animal products in a consensual, cruelty-free way. This is not the case for the products of human labor. It is absolutely possible to acquire the products of other humans labor in a consensual, non-exploitative, and cruelty-free way (eg someone makes something and gives it to you as a gift). The point being, the problem with animal products is inherent, and the cause of the associated cruelty is the consumption of those products, whereas for products of human labor, the problem lies in the system of production and distribution(capitalism). Ending consumption of animal products is possible and the only means for ending exploitation of non-human animals. Avoiding the consumption of products of exploited human labor is impossible, and attempting to do so will be ineffectual. Being vegan and still using products of exploited human labor is not inconsistent, it just an acknowledgement that the natures of the problems, while related, are not identical, and addressing them therefore requires different tactics. I'd argue that being vegan and non anti-capitalist is hypocritical(hence veganarchism, the combination of veganism and anarchism), but that's not the relevant point here. (or is it? I don't know.)"
CMV:I should stop being a vegan,nikoberg,0,"For cancer, [here](http://www.bmj.com/content/308/6945/1667?variant=full) is a study about cancer and meat. Generally speaking, eating moderate quantities of meat won't lead to cancer. While rates of cancer are lower in vegetarians, it's almost certainly because vegetarians also tend to do other things that are healthy, not because meat inherently causes cancer. However, if you can stand to give up eating meat and dairy products, so far we haven't seen any real problems to that, either, if you fulfill your nutritional requirements. If you're really worried, I would recommend just asking a nutritionist. You will get the same conclusions I just noted- eating moderate amounts of meat isn't harmful to you. Anxiety about this will be reduced much more if you can hear the advice from a trusted source, which no one on here can provide past a study short of scanning a medical diploma and showing it to you. Other than that, have you read """"The Ominvore's Dilemma"""" by Michael Pollan? It's fairly well-known at this point, so hopefully the name rings a bell. He provides a couple points on why it might not be ethically imperative to be vegan. First of all, as you noted, it's not cost free to you to be a vegan because of how our society is structured. You give up on social activities; you have to spend significant time and effort to avoid figuring out how to plan a meatless diet, because to some extend you're circumventing how our bodies were designed to function. So given that it entails a real cost to yourself beyond just giving up the taste of meat, maybe you're not as ethically obligated to harm yourself to help animals as you feel. However, it's still pretty hard to justify factory farming if you think animals have any ethical status whatsoever. You are literally subjecting some number of animals to a life of torture for your benefit. Most people who shrug and say """"meat is tasty, whatever"""" are just ignoring the problem because it's a hugely inconvenient one for them- no factory farming means much more expensive meat and dairy products. (Unless they really do believe animals don't matter, but if they did, they also have to be the kind of person who would say it's okay to kick a puppy for fun. Very few people will admit to that, so I have to assume they're either willfully ignorant hypocrites or too timid to admit what they really think for fear of social backlash.) Luckily, there are alternative suppliers for meat if you can afford it. Pollan basically advocates for getting your meat locally, from farmers you can trust to have raised animals in a manner which did not, for example, involve raising animals that are literally in pain every second of their lives because their bodies are too big for their legs (chickens, if anyone is wondering), or make them so stressed they will literally chew off the tails of themselves or other animals nearby (pigs in this case). I think that there's really not too much wrong with killing an animal provided you made sure it had a good life to start with, and would say you can get animal products from those sources. I would also recommend reading his book if you're interested."
CMV:I should stop being a vegan,minerva_qw,0,"&gt;I am not a good cook, and there is very little I can eat. When I do cook (I mostly make soups or chilis, with rice), it takes a lot of time, and it doesn't taste all that great. Others have mentioned you need better recipes: [Thug Kitchen](http://www.thugkitchen.com/) and [Vegan Stoner](http://theveganstoner.blogspot.com/) both have tasty, simple recipes. Also, you can minimize the time you spend cooking by making large batches and freezing meals in individual portions. Intersperse these meals with fast options like sandwiches and oatmeal, and you'll really spend very little time in the kitchen. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/2u99rv/hey_guys_just_need_to_ask_a_question/co6fmvo) are a few of my personal favorite recipes. &gt;When my friends invite me out to eat, I often can't eat anything. First of all, if you're not already, it's well within your rights to suggest the restaurant sometimes. I'm sure you have some go-to spots, but if not, try checking [Happy Cow](http://www.happycow.net/) or Yelp for veg-friendly locations. But when you don't have a choice, try checking the menu beforehand and calling ahead so that you know what your options are. If the pickings are slim, plan to eat before or afterward, maybe just having a drink or something light, and enjoy your friends' company. If they ask why you're not eating, tell them you're not hungry but you still wanted to come hang out. It doesn't need to be a big deal. &gt;I am coming to believe that conformity has very real value, even if what we're adhering to was set arbitrarily, because we're social animals and we need to be around others. Is food the only thing you have in common with your friends? I suspect the answer is no. Hopefully they like you because of similar interests, and compatible personality and character traits. Part of that is your concern and caring for others, which is a wonderful thing! Don't mute that part of yourself to fit in. You don't need to emphasize your dietary choices if it makes you uncomfortable. Just have a few stock phrases to change the subject when it comes up. Why won't you eat that? Personal reasons, I'm not hungry, I don't really like to talk about it while I'm eating, etc. Then get back to talking about the things that you do have in common. &gt;The clothes I wear were made in a sweatshop, the fruits and vegetables I eat were picked by illegal immigrants, my phone and computer contain metals that people died to secure, I implicitly support a government that bombs citizens in third-world countries, and so on. If I stop eating animal products for ethical reasons, I think I would logically have to change all of the above behaviors in order to be consistent. Nope. You just have to do the best you can. One of my favorite vegan advocates, [Colleen Patrick-Goudreau](http://www.joyfulvegan.com/), has a quote that I love: """"Don't do nothing because you can't do everything. Do something, anything."""" (Her podcast is awesome, btw, definitely check it out if you get the chance.) Would you refuse to feed someone who was hungry because you couldn't feed every hungry person? Would you say it's pointless to work against animal abuse because you're not also working against domestic violence? Sometimes we have to pick our battles, but that doesn't make us hypocritical. Do what you can now, and when you can do more, do. What makes your food choices so powerful is that every time you sit down for a meal you have a chance to act on your values. The other things you mention are more abstract and often more difficult to take action on. You can't really choose what government you're born under. There's so little transparency in supply chains that it can be hard to know what you're getting even when you make an effort to source things ethically. Although, I do want to mention that buying used goods is a good way to avoid funding problematic labor practices. &gt;At some point, I need to live my life, even if it harms others. And if we accept that such a point exists, it seems arbitrary where we draw that line between the things we need to do to live our own lives, and the excess luxuries we needlessly partake in. I'd like to draw your attention to the definition of veganism coined by Donald Watson, originator of the term, in 1944: """"Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, *as far as possible and practicable*, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose."""" Note the """"as far as possible and practicable."""" It's not a purity contest, it's not about perfection. It's just doing your best to avoid supporting cruelty and exploitation when you can. If you fall short sometimes, that's okay. I know it can be overwhelming, but blocking out the injustices of the world and pretending they aren't happening isn't the answer. Stay informed, do your best, be forgiving of yourself, and do more when you can. The effort itself is worthwhile, and it does have real effects on the world around you. &gt;I do strength training, but I have trouble getting the amount of protein that fitness forums recommend. &gt;I want you to change my view because I fear the implications that eating meat causes cancer As for health, it's not my primary motivation, but you may already know about the [American Dietetic Association's](http://www.eatright.org/) stance on [vegan and vegetarian diets](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864): &gt;Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, **and for athletes.** Here are some resources I found that may help in meeting your training goals: [Vegan Body Building](http://www.veganbodybuilding.com/?page=news), [Vegan Health](http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/weightlifting), [No Meat Athlete](http://www.nomeatathlete.com/gain-weight-vegan/). I was able to find [this](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/63.) study which seems to show that consumption of red meat or processed meat does correlate with higher rates of cancer and cardiovascular disease. But, I'm no scientist. Personally, while I think it's easier to eat healthfully on a vegan diet, I don't think it's the best or only way to be healthy. Nor does having a vegan diet guarantee health. But it's the ethical, environmental, and public health issues that really push it over the edge for me. I really think there are a lot of worthwhile reasons to be vegan, and it need not be an excessive burden. I really do hope you'll find some useful ideas in what I've written above and reconsider."
CMV: most people's opinion of animal rights doesn't really make sense,Doriphor,0,Interspecies cooperation is a thing. It's not just human nature to prefer/not harm certain species and eat others.
CMV: most people's opinion of animal rights doesn't really make sense,Kitteas,0,"It depends on how you define 'fairness'! Oddly enough, people are fair in their unfairness. There is no such thing as equality, and this spans not just to other species but to other humans as well, for example. It has everything to do with human nature and the way we percieve things. Favoritism for instance is related to the issue you speak of - a rule of thumb is that we will always hold certain things above others. It makes sense that we tend to hold a few animals above others, when you think about it that way. Particularly the ones we can relate to and empathize more with, such as dogs and cats. Dogs and cats are examples of animals who have learned to live with humans. All of us being social animals, we value their companionship and in this way, that is their role in our lives. Humans in general subconsciously rank things by degrees of their value, and how helpful we find them to be. Canines were first domesticated for help with hunting, but nowadays they serve moreso as companions and partners. With undomesticated animals, they serve no such role and it's very difficult for example, to have a cow around as a pet. Human history has long since used them for sustenance however, and we still do, except as food has become more plentiful, we have had more options for meals available to us. This has allowed us to weigh the pros and the cons for other living species, versus things such as plants, vegetables, fruit, etc. Once again we empathize with them via human terms, and try to put them down as humanely as possible. This is basically what animals rights is, and its very subjective in many ways. I think innately everyone knows that certain species have received the short end of the stick. But as with everything, life is ranked by dominance, and human beings are at the very top. We try our best to understand the other species but we can only do it from our human POVs. From the beginning it was never fair, but it's never really changed, either. We have always been unfair, but been that way towards everything using the rule of thumb of judging them on our terms."
CMV: most people's opinion of animal rights doesn't really make sense,YourArmpitStinks,0,Our view on rights of animals matters because it helps us sleep at night better if we don't think about the horrible life our last meal went through before it reached our plate. This alone I think makes sense. Is it fair? Not at all. But it doesn't need to be. It just needs to make us feel that our meal's death and agonizing life was justified in some way.
CMV: most people's opinion of animal rights doesn't really make sense,AlbertoAru,0,"&gt;To clarify I am NOT a vegetarian or vegan and eat meat and other such products almost everyday. I think consuming meat is not very ethical, but it's not unethical enough for me to change my habits. [Why not?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNtlxrTvey8) consuming meat is not ethical at all, maybe you should consider go vegan to avoid unnecessarily killing animals, as you can see in the links. 1. Totally agree. Seriously, I don't get why you aren't vegan yet. 2. YES. [In fact, I think you'd like this post](http://bldgwlf.com/think-panda/) 3. Are you sure you're not vegan? you're absolutely right!! I used to eat meat until I got angry with myself because I was eating animals without any excuse, so I became vegetarian. After researching, I discovered that veganism was delightfully perfect, so I went vegan, it's not so hard as I thought, quite the opposite: the hardest part is doing the step. &gt;I personally don't mind eating any animal as long as it is not gratuitously tortured beforehand. [Why?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVxh3ZFSslg) I just don't get how can anyone think this way, I'd love to know it, maybe we can get an interesting conversation after all. **EDIT**: Rules 1 and 5"

CMV: most people's opinion of animal rights doesn't really make sense,hacksoncode,0,"The reasoning behind this is rarely stated, but is very real and justified. Human morality is *very* unlikely to have evolved for any reason other than to benefit the human species by enabling us to reap the benefits from living in societies. Extending moral rights to other animals doesn't actually make logical sense at all... except to the extent that it helps humans either directly, or helps us to live together in societies. And not eating animals that humans consider companions actually really *does* help us live together in societies."

Killing something that can empathize with you (and vice versa), but is not self-aware may not be immoral, per se, but it's certainly a red flag.

I believe that human needs are always more important than animal rights. CMV,HomicidalChris,0,"To summarize your statement: Any nonzero human interest supercedes any animal's rights. I can torture and kill millions of an animal into extinction (if it won't negatively impact other humans) just because I'm bored and for no greater reasons. I have some want, and no animal has any rights whatsoever. So what makes this assertion tick? Case 1: If you draw the line at things which are genetically human, your moral distinction is arbitrary and absurd. What about intellectually advanced space aliens? What about space aliens who are slightly less advanced than humanity? What about an alien culture which is not as intellectually advanced but could be in the future? Now what about a human society with genetic and/or cultural differences like a race of mutants, or just people of a different race period? If you're just going to go by the convenience of the """"in group"""" (humans in this case) then your logic is equivalent to that of a racist, just with a less reprehensible arbitrary dividing line. In that case you have to also admit that it would be morally okay for a human to commit genocide on a race of advanced space aliens in order to be consistent, which is absurd. What about once we figure out how to upload human brains into robots and computers? Or create genetically modified bodies for ourselves that are no longer human? What if I figure out how to upload my brain into a dog? DNA contents are not a reasonable dividing line. Case 2: You draw the line at cognitive ability. Things with higher cognitive ability have no obligation to respect the rights of things with lower cognitive ability. In this case you'd have to admit that a race of advanced space aliens would be morally right to commit genocide on humanity because it's bored in order to be consistent. Would that also extend to a parent slaughtering their child? Further problems: There are animals which have been taught sign language and painting, and those which naturally use tools. In order to be consistent you'd have to say that those animals have more rights than a human infant which has none of those things. You also open the flood gates to all kinds of disgusting paternalistic justifications like those which were used to justify slavery. Case 3: The alternative to the idea that it's higher cognitive ability is better is the idea that at a CERTAIN LEVEL of cognitive ability things gain the right to be respected. Just like the case of deciding by genetics, this is also an arbitrary threshold. If you draw one or both of these arbitrary dividing lines, fair enough. But morality generally should be based on *something* other than bare assertions. If it's completely arbitrary and based on opinion, then there's no common ground on which to debate or change your view. But it's exactly the same as racist's who, once their pseudoscience is discredited, clings to the assertion that other races are """"just different."""" We hunt and kill animals for sustenance out of want and necessity. We inflict suffering on creatures but try to keep it to a minimum so we can just """"let it slide"""" due to the immense benefit to humanity. What about the future when technology removes that need for the most part? If we can grow better than steakhouse quality meat. According to your argument I can still torture a cow to death just because I think watching it die would be funny. In that case, given that your dividing lines are completely arbitrary, the inflicted suffering is unnecessary, has severe real life consequences for the creature I'm inflicting it on, with little to no benefit to me, would you then be willing to say that it's wrong in that case? According to your OP you would not."

Factory farming *can* cause unfathomable amounts of distress and pain. Just a couple of simple laws can change this. I don't want to outlaw factory farming, but animals should have a reasonably painless existence and death. Sure, humans are more important than animals. We probably experience pain and loss more intensely than squirrels and spiders. And pigs are not going to cure cancer. But ultimately, the only purpose there is, is to maximize well-being and minimize suffering.

I believe that human needs are always more important than animal rights. CMV,funchy,0,"The problem is that comparing apples to oranges. You're comparing life/death survival of a being of another species in the same context as humans enjoying meaning or killing living things for pleasure. For example if you said if a human was truly starving to death, even a vegetarian would probably kill animal if it meant saving their own life when no other options exist. I think that falls in the same line of thinking for self defense against people: we might be OK with another human if it meant saving your own life and no other option exists, but we don't go around killing people for fun. But there's a world of difference between meeting a human's needs - versus catering to whims or entertainment or downright stupidity. If you must kill the animals to live, that's completely different then shooting at animals in a small fenced area for fun. Or dog fighting. Or kitten crush videos. Or the atrocities tolerated at factory farms. I believe that human society would not suffer if we were to exercise some self control and not tolerate unnecessary animal abuse or animal exploitation. I think for us to consider your point of view seriously, you need to prove that human society would undoubtedly suffer if we ended practices, for example ending dog fighting. The reason why animals abuse is wrong isn't because animals can vote and would vote against it. It's because of the damage that animal abuse does to society. We find it offensive for a reason. Researchers have shown a link between those who enjoy torturing animals and later violent crimes against humans. How we treat the defenseless members around us says a lot about our society. We don't abuse animals, not because were inferior, because were superior and we strive to be better than that. I like to point out that human beings take pride in a sesnse of superiority over other peoplec; we fancy ourself civilized and no longer savages. We look down on people who show savage behavior. Unnecessary aggression is not a good trait. Through the generations we slowly rejected cruelty such as slavery and infanticide. And as we developed a more advanced sense of empathy, most of us can't help but feel compassion towards animals that in some ways are very similar to us. We're smarter and more aware now. We can no longer can deny that animals can feel pain and suffering. So as we look forward and aspire to be even better, it becomes harder and harder to turn a blind eye to inflicting killing or suffering that clearly isnt necessary for our species success. I think basic protection for animals is an alignment with the belief that life should be valued, human or otherwise. How can we teach our children that killing or abusing another person is wrong when they see us beat a losing dog fighting dog to death in front of them? The message """"life is valuable"""" is central to many religions. It seems arbitrary to say that killing is terrible however animals have zero value and we can kill them all we like. Your cognitive dissonance is allowing you to invent this arbitrary decision so that you don't have to feel uncomfortable if you are presented with awareness of animal abuse. But just because you have the ability to turn off empathetic feelings towards abused animals doesn't mean that as a society it's a good thing or should be promoted. Just because we can do something doesn't mean we should. It's because we have superior reasoning that is our moral obligation to consider what we do and why. I think we have the obligation to ask if we really need to cause suffering to another aware being, human or otherwise. I think we're more like other animals then we are different. No matter how clever we think we are, we're a part of the ecosystem and were dependent on other living things. When we lose respect for other living things, systems go out balance. We can't kill off big parts of food chains without it having some effect on the food sources humans are dependent on. Its not us verses other species - it's us in a symbiotic relationship with the food chain. We are just as much a child of the earth as are the animals around us. No matter how advanced our science, we will always need other living things."
I believe that human needs are always more important than animal rights. CMV,LetThemEatWar32,0,"This issue boils down to one key element: are animals property, or are they persons? In my opinion, something like a dog could far more appropriately be compared to a human than to say a car. However, the terminology is restrictive, because to treat a dog like a human is hardly fitting either (should Fido be allowed to vote as well?). Animals do not fit into either category very well. It is for this reason that I favour introducing a third category into the libertarian perspective that could allow for animals to be afforded some intermediate level of state protection. Your argument about the suffering of animals being justified by a net gain to the human collective is fairly unbecoming of a supposed individualist."
I believe that human needs are always more important than animal rights. CMV,MarcusLT,0,"I read an article not long ago, which talked about the intelligence of Dolphins and certain species of Whale. There was a group of Canadian scientists who proposed Dolphins should have similar rights to humans. For example, the right to life, the right to freedom (which would mean dolphins in captivity in places like Sea World, or anywhere, would be classed as slavery) and some others. The scientists argued that Dolphins, like humans, are self aware. They recognize their reflection, they have a """"self concept"""" and are highly intelligent- emotionally too. I would include the link to the BBC article, but I can't find it unfortunately. I personally agree with this particular group of scientists, and so when I answer your CMV I am holding Dolphins up next to humans in terms of relative importance. I agree LOOSELY with the idea that humans should put themselves first. It's only natural that we strive to grow and thrive. However I disagree with your apparent disregard to protecting other animals. Let's not forget that we humans ARE, just """"animals"""". We are a product of evolution and nothing more. We should not hold ourselves in such high esteem. It is my belief the human race should be a lot more humble. While putting ourselves first, we should also strive towards a more eco friendly, co-operative future that helps to preserve biodiversity and ensuring we help other species thrive as well. You mentioned you did not believe the poor treatment of other animals should be punishable by the law. I disagree. I think it's actually rather worrying that an individual should see it fit to turn a blind eye to animal cruelty. Any individual who harms a living being (human or otherwise) unprovoked, without themselves being in imminent danger, is in my opinion a small, small person who's value of life instantly drops. This individual should be punished by the law. An individual, for example, who takes pleasure in inflicting pain on animals is """"evil"""" and should be punished for his wrong-doings. Humans like to see themselves apart, and above other animals. We like to think we are the elite- and we are. But only in a sense. Only because we won the evolutionary lottery on our planet. This however does not give us the right to kick and trample on the other species we share this wonderful planet with. It wasn't long ago that white people felt superior to black people. Humans being """"apart"""" from other animals is, in my opinion, the same as someone claiming a black person is fundamentally different from a white person. The black person is different on the outside, but on the inside we are the same. This is of course not entirely the same when I speak about other species, but in a sense it is. They are (more often than not) capable of emotions and sometimes even rival human intelligence (e.g dolphins)."

Because if so, then you are saying that the """"need"""" of the human to torture the animal is more important than the life of the animal. First of all, does a human """"need"""" to torture an animal? I don't think that there is any realistic case in which a human """"needs"""" to torture an animal. Secondly, you say that we should criticize someone who tortures animals, and I agree. But you also say that the person should not be arrested if they do no harm to another person. I can see where you are coming from based on your standpoint in the rest of the post. As I understand it, the human """"need"""" is more important than the animal, and I agree in most cases. But in this case, what do we gain by harm? An animal is tortured, and humanity as a whole gains nothing but possibly some sick kind of pleasure. I for one, don't think we need any more suffering and pain in the world than we already have. Even if you believe animals are inferior to humans, we know they experience emotions such as pain. If you comprehend this, and still think the meaningless torture of animals is ok, then I cannot understand your viewpoint. In many cases, I can support your argument, but it is not an exclusive argument. There are cases in which it is untrue, and I believe that meaningless torture of animals is one of them."

Here is an extreme example, serial killers tend to torture animals. This is both a reflection of their state of mind and a catalyst. Another less thought of example is a subjective parallel of how a person cares less about a cow if he doesn't see it killed before he eats it and how a person doesn't care about the Chinese kid stitching his or her clothing at slave wages. Granted while limited (possibly negligible), people become more apathetic or more accepting of these things out of convenience.

Look at the near-elimination of the Amazon rain-forest for instance. This deforestation process is genocidal in itself, never mind how catastrophic it is for the climate. The main driver by far is the demand for meat (and soy, which is mostly used to feed livestock). The idea that everyone can and should eat meat at every meal if they can afford it is fueling an absolute global catastrophe. The fact that this also produces unnecessary suffering for many millions of animals only adds to the urgency of reducing meat consumption by everyone who will not otherwise suffer from a lack of nutrition."

So, if grouped according to neurological perspectives, aka, ability to feel pleasure and pain, and awareness of existense, we would have ( Jellyfish (cockroach (cat (ape human) ) ) ) This perspective does not project humans as something extraordinarily separate from animals rather a part of the animal family. If so, there is no justification as to why a trivial need of a human has more importance than happiness of a closely related and intelligent animal, if both the human and the animal has similar IQ, similar social bonding, emotions and the ability to feel pleasure and pain.

I'm not going to get super wordy and hopefully you can pick up the vibe of what I mean. Humans are not important in the grand scheme. We only think we are because it directly effects us. The short short version is that humans suck. They war amoungst each other for stupid reasons. They hurt, maim and kill each other for with intentional malice. They are cruel for simply evil reasons. They hurt what they don't understand and are small, petty, close-minded creatures who refuse to think outside their own tiny scope, even though they have the ability to do so. Simple example, just look at reddit. There are people on here who are cruel and stupid and vicious for no other reason than it amuses their small little minds.

CMV,jagman33,0,"you mentioned that """"animal abuse leads to human abuse"""" is a slippery fallacy, how exactly is that a slippery slope? or, for that matter, a fallacy? several studies have correlated that any act of aggression, independent of the object (pillow, punching bag, animals, etc.) it is directed against, increases the likelihood of future acts of aggression towards piers. So, while it may not directly be harming a person at that moment, I would highly disagree with you that it is a fallacy and should not be taken into account. What's more, animals are living creatures, albeit without many of the intellectual and communication abilities (among other things) of the average human. When we acclimate our society to the abuse of animals, are we not acclimating our society to the abuse of those with disabilities? consider how the mentally ill/intellectually disabled were treated just a few decades ago. absolutely barbaric. Is it a coincidence that the rise of their rights came slightly after the rise of rights for animals? (please don't think that I am comparing the two groups as similar, rather making an observation) Furthermore, the attitude that 'human needs trump animals rights' is the same type of attitude that brings our environment into depravity. without environmental protection laws rivers would still be burning (check out Cuyahoga River for a famous example). even as it is, we are still destroying Eco-systems with our 'our needs come first' attitude. We know, through extensive research, that the environment thrives on biodiversity and the idea that, no matter how small, all creatures depend on each other. While this respect may not be instilled in us at birth, it truly is an important part of life. Throughout human history, laws and rules have been put in place to instill a set of cultural values, that's why each government has a different set of laws. Take stealing, for instance. In the survival of the fittest mindset, stealing would be fine, if you are fit enough to do so. But considering that, at least in developed nations, survival is not the top concern for the majority, it doesn't make sense for social improvement to allow stealing. By making it illegal the government has instilled the moral that stealing is bad to those that may other wise not have thought about it. By outlawing certain waste removal practices, we are both expressing a desire and instilling an idea that the environment is important. By outlawing animal abuse, we are both express a desire to respect other living beings and instilling the idea that living beings are important, especially in the cases of near-extinct species.

You've made a completely arbitrary distinction of who deserves protection by the state, humans, but not animals. Why? Because you believe humans suffer, but not animals? Or simply because you are human and they are not? What's then to stop you making similar distinctions amongst humans. Maybe the wants of right handed people should always trump the rights of left handed people? Until you have some kind of reasoning for making your distinction, I can't really argue against it to change your view. Two points I want to make though are: 1. using the word 'need' correctly, few animal rights advocates would say animal rights trump human needs, but it's very rare that it is the case that they are pitted against each other. 2.

To me that seems disrespectful of animals, however weird that sentence may sound. Who are we to decide that they are more worth than us? Anyway, my real argument is this, and I take it from Henry David Thoreau: We shouldn't look at dividing animals and humans in our thinking. Instead we should think of killing an animal (or human!) as taking a life, of quenching a desire to live, wantonly removing the only reason for it's existence. Recklessness and myopia should not be viewed in a different way just because we're dealing with an animal compared to a human. I'm not saying we should begin trialing people killing animals on the same level as mass murderers, that's not possible nor desirable, especially since the human mind naturally doesn't regard animals as highly as fellow human beings. I'm saying that taking any life should never be done with swift abandon, and mindless killings or molesting of animals should be punished in some way or another. Not because they're worth as much as a human, but because they hold their life dearly (as we do), and that is worth something."

I believe that human needs are always more important than animal rights. CMV,maxpenny42,0,"You seem to favor environmental concerns due to your libertarian background. Let me appeal to that. Factory farming is a disaster to our environment. Look at waste for example. If cows are allowed to take up a reasonable amount of land their waste is dispersed across it like nature intended and is then broken down as fertilizer. The means that cow basically helps regrow the plants it eats. In factory farming so much waste is accumulated in a single place that it becomes toxic and a hazard to dispose of and contaminates our drinking water and released excess amounts of methane and other chemicals in one place. All pretty horrible stuff. Or look at the excessive use of antibiotics. When you have that many animals cooped up in one location, unable to moved and live normal, low stress lives, disease can run rampant. To combat this, factory farms are forced to use antibiotics but that use ultimately leads to stronger, more drug resistant bacteria and makes human medicinal antibiotics that much less effective. Now why do you seem to treat animals as no different than inanimate objects? Why should I be allowed to torture one for no other reason than I want to? If a dog attacks a human unprovoked then I agree with humans defending themselves and am even open to the idea of putting down the animal as too dangerous. But what if that person locks the dog in his basement and abuses the animal and puts the animal in a corner with an intent to attack it? Doesn't the animal have a right to defend itself? When humans want to stop an animal from endangering their life or even their livelihood (wolves eating livestock) I understand why the would hurt those animals in self defense. But when humans needlessly put themselves in danger of wild animals I root for the animal to triumph (having a fucking cougar as a pet, for instance). If humans can accomplish the same thing without hurting an animal, why would we bother hurting an animal (fur coats when fake fur exists) In most cases like the fur coat example I choose to avoid hurting an animal rather than outlawing the practice. But if we are talking about hurting an animal out of some sadistic pleasure, there is no excuse for that."

I ask because I'd like to establish a baseline here for what you actually consider a valid reason to subject animals to situations that you wouldn't want to subject humans to. &gt; If someone enjoys harming animals, then all we should do its criticize, but in the end, human needs should always trump animal rights. This is part of what led me to pose the question above. You seem to be saying that we shouldn't intervene in cases of animal cruelty because it is not a person being hurt. Then you say that human needs trump animals rights, so by your definition of """"needs"""" me microwaving a cat until it explodes is something that I """"need"""" to do because it gives me comfort. You don't think that anyone should stop me from blowing up cats in the microwave for no good reason other than that it gives me """"comfort""""? You don't think that maybe the fact that I receive comfort from blowing up cats is indicative of a psychological problem that could pose a danger to other people? What I'm seeing here is that you think harming animals is abhorrent but at the same time you don't think avoiding it should take precedence over human needs. The problem I see with your argument is that it assumes we *have* to harm animals to serve our own needs, which is not the case. There are plenty of humane ways to slaughter animals, and you can let them live a comfortable and somewhat natural life before you do slaughter them in a humane way. The inhumane practices in places like factory farming that you are referring to really aren't """"needed"""" unless you use an extremely broad definition that involves enabling """"comfort"""". In reality the """"comfort"""" being generated by the cruel practices you referenced is mostly in the form of extra profits for those at the top of the factory farm system. The world could get by just fine with more humane practices which treat animals the way we would want to be treated, in part because we don't even need to eat as much meat as we do. Just look at India for an idea of how the food system could be run in a more humane way, they sure as shit don't need all the beef that Americans use for comfort food. But then of course this brings us back to your definition of """"needs"""", which honestly is so broad that I find it severely absurd. The problem with your statement is that you're talking about putting human needs before animal rights, but the content of your argument is really about putting human *wants* and human *luxury* before animal rights."

Chimpanzees and gorillas have been shown to have an intelligence that is typically comparable to that of a five year old human child. I find that very impressive. You can talk to five year old children, and you can also talk to gorillas if you use necessary mechanisms to overcome the fact that they are physically not capable of speaking; they can type on a keyboard, or they can lean sign language. This has been done. It is now very difficult for me to perceive the great apes as creatures with no rights. They are too close to human. Cetaceans (whales and dolphins) are another interesting case. Biologists generally believe that they are intelligent as animals go, but not quite as intelligent as the great apes. However, the problems of communicating with them are greater (for example, without fingers they cannot either type on a keyboard or use sign language) and it may be that we just do not fully appreciate how intelligent they are. I would tend to give them the benefit of the doubt. And there could be other intelligent species as well. How intelligent is an octopus? They seem to be intelligent, but it is hard to say exactly how intelligent they are. Chickens are not very intelligent (I make this claim despite PETA claims to the contrary) but even so, I would not wish to utterly disregard their suffering in factory farms.

Humans or non-humans, pain is pain. Realistically though, I understand that consuming animals is a natural part of life.

Well, if you judge a fish by its tree-climbing skills it isn't fair is it? The concept that """"we are more evolved"""" is sort of a phalacy. We aren't **more** evolved, we evolved differently.

I believe that human needs are always more important than animal rights. CMV,CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH,1,"Many times an animals rights is tied to a humans rights. Let's say a man is hungry. He sees his neighbors dog, then he shoots and kills it so he can have a snack. But before the dog dies from the shot he tortures it in front of his neighbors 7 year old child. Now obviously this is illegal because that dog costs maybe 500 dollars and to replace it would be 500 dollars. But under our current laws we treat such a crime as far worse than doing 500 dollars of damage to their car. The reason we do this is because many humans have extreme attachments to animals, even if these attachments are not logical. This same logic applies to poaching endangered animals. Even though killing the animal will satisfy a human need it damages other human needs even more. I agree that animals don't really have any rights. But what we call animal rights is really just protecting human rights to their attachment to said animals. For example let's say their is a country that worships rabbits. In this country all of the population collectively owns the rabbits, or has some partial ownership of each rabbit. When someone kills a rabbit they are damaging a piece of property that everyone owns. If they value that property highly than they have the right to have strict punishments. While on the surface it looks like they are protecting the animals rights, and they may even say that as they do worship the animal. The deeper truth is they are protecting their property."
I believe that human needs are always more important than animal rights. CMV,calsaverini,0,"First of all, let me tell that arguing ethics and morals is always difficult. We will always tend to use subjective values. Moral and ethical behavior is based more on gut feeling than rational evaluation (there is actual hard neurological evidence for this). Also, I'm not a vegan nor an animal rights activist, so my view in this issue is a lot softer than the views of some other people. I eat meat all the time and I do not feel morally challenged by it. Yet... Having said that, let me tell why I have a trouble with saying that """"humans do so and so, therefore we are superior, therefore we are entitled with more rights than other animals"""". The main point that makes me think about animals as having rights of their own to well being and protection is the fact that, as Jane Goodal once put it, """"there isn't a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom"""". If you take a sufficiently big sample of all currently living great primates and put them in one room, it would be reasonably easy to distinguish who is the human, who is the chimpanzee, who is the gorilla, etc. There will hardly be any edge cases. Maybe if you're not an expert you couldn't differentiate some smaller """"chimp looking"""" gorillas from some bulkier """"gorilla looking"""" chimps, but I doubt it. There are clearly distinct groups of animals there, so what do I mean by """"no sharp line""""? Well, take the fathers of those specimen animals down there to our room and compare them. Still, very sharp differences. Now take their fathers. You are probably realizing where I'm trying to go. If we go hundreds and hundreds of generations to the past, the differences will start to get smaller. When we start taking specimens from about 6 million years ago, there will be no difference at all between humans and chimps. If we take a random sample of great primates from the last 6 million years ago, and put they all together in one place, you will be *unable to tell, in that group, what separates humans and chimps*. Everywhere you draw the line, I can show you a father and a son in different sides of your line. The point is, there is a continuity of life. It is not easy to define what constitute a species. The reality is that the concept of """"species"""" is an intellectual construct. It isn't really real. It's just a useful way of talking about life on earth, but this is a very limited concept. And it is so difficult to define species that there are not one, but dozens of different definitions: ecological definitions, phylogenetic definitions, cohesion definitions, biological definitions, etc. Under some definitions that are *actually used by biologists* to classify animal samples, like the genetic definition, you could classify humans and chimps as variations of the same species depending only on where do you cut off genetic differences to constitute a new species. There are insect and bird species where the intrinsic genetic variability within one species is greater than the difference between chimps and humans. So, let's say your in that room filled with great apes and I tell you: """"ok, now, of those animals here in this room, point to me everybody who is entitled to basic human rights"""", what would you do? Well, you'll start by pointing to one of the modern humans that are easy to spot. Then you'll point to their fathers, their cousins and all other """"human looking"""" animals, and so on. But you'll have to stop somewhere, because you know there are some chimps in there, who should not be called human or be granted human rights. **Inevitably** there will be a point when you'll grant human status and human rights to one animal and not to another who is **almost identical** to him. You'll have to inevitably call somebody human and not his father or his cousins. This is the point where the logic of specism fails: evolution is a continuous process, not a lumpy one. It gets from A to B in small, continuous steps. So, the little exercise above can be done with any species, and we can go back in time more and more and there'll be a continuous path of similar looking individuals that links us with **any other species**! There's a continuous path of similar looking individuals linking you with a rat, a mole, a blue whale, a dinosaur, an ant, a cockroach, a cow, a salmon, a rattlesnake, a banana tree! Every single species is part of a continuum of individuals, surrounded by similar looking individuals, and than less similar individuals, and so on, until you reach the next """"species"""". The only reason we don't see it, is because all those intermediate individuals are now dead. So, if we can't tell apart what is human and what is not, if we must draw the line between two almost identical individuals and say """"this side human, must respect, this other side not human, can kill and eat"""", this argument kind of fails. It's not that humans can do what they please because they have biological, physical and intellectual characteristics that make them superior. It's just because they can. We have power to do so, so we do so. When other animals had the means to overpower us, they do what they please to us. And we are every bit just that: animals. All our behavior, all our necessities, instincts and even moral judgments, stem from the same source that all animal behavior stems from: evolution. We just happen to have a little bit more complex brains, that can process more information and create more intricate patterns of behavior. But even in this respect, there's a continuity of animal behavior from ants building their nests to humans building computers, passing though Australopithecines cooking food and beavers making dams. This is why we should give a second look on animal rights. :)"
I believe that human needs are always more important than animal rights. CMV,nankerjphelge,0,"It is normal for any species to consider its own needs superior to those of any other as a matter of self interest and preservation. Humans are no different, so to only view the limits of legality and rights in terms of one's own species is a normal self-interested response. However, where humans *are* different is that we have a greater capacity for empathy and higher reason, and as such that creates a greater responsibility with respect to the animals which are under our care and dominion. It has been established that animals feel pain, can suffer, and many are capable of experiencing emotions. Therefore, we as humans have a moral and ethical, and one would argue by extension legal responsibility to afford them many of the rights that we expect for ourselves, at least where needless suffering and torture is involved. In war, there is the Geneva Convention, which although it accepts the fact that humans can and do kill other humans in war, the line is drawn at torturing other humans, because it is inhumane, even in bloody war. The same should apply to animals, in that they may be part of our food supply, but that does not mean that there should not be laws or standards by which their treatment is governed. Ultimately the human-centric argument is one of a self interested perspective, but if we as a species are to live up to our potential as a species of higher intelligence and compassion, which goes far beyond simple self-interest, then certain rights regarding the treatment of animals should be afforded to them."

These people are just as bad and toxic as people who do this to people. Honestly if you are so stuck with this view you should also think it's ok to leave a child to starve, be beaten, electrocuted and have his or her legs broken. Maybe your family, a close friend. They have just as many pain receptors and feelings. Also if you do love animals I can't believe it. If you love or like them you would care if bad things happened to them.

I believe that global vegetarianism/veganism is both economically impossible and ecologically irresponsible. CMV,excultist,0,"The vegan diet strikes me as extreme, but let us consider vegetarianism. Most vegetarians do eat dairy food, some also eat eggs. There is really no ethical impediment to eating eggs as long as the chickens which lay them are well treated, since an unfertilized egg is not a living creature, just a by-product of a living creature. Even without eggs, dairy products such as milk, cheese, yogurt, etc., are very nutritious and have approximately as much protein as meat. (Some forms of vegetarianism also allow fish in the diet, and only prohibit the eating of land animals.) Raising dairy cows for their milk is more economically and environmentally sustainable than raising cows for meat, and it satisfies the moral imperatives of vegetarianism (again, if the cows are well treated, which they should be). Eating meat creates a number of problems which you do not consider. Cows can become infected with a number of diseases which to some extent can then affect the people who eat them. We still do not know how serious mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) will prove to be for the human population, since it has a very long incubation period. We could still be facing an impending epidemic of variant Kreuzfeld-Jaacov disease. Diets high in meat can result in high cholesterol in the blood, and cardio-pulmonary disease. You argument about marginal land that supports cattle but not nutritious vegetables is not true. You mentioned that you can grow soy beans; these can be used to make a popular meat substitute called tofu. There are lots of good foods that can be produced from land currently used to graze cattle. When you add in the excess methane that is generated by huge herds of cattle, I think there is a very strong argument that the human race would be better off adopting vegetarianism of some form (but ideally, still eating dairy, eggs, and fish)."
I believe that global vegetarianism/veganism is both economically impossible and ecologically irresponsible. CMV,Duffalpha,0,"I did rangeland management for my thesis. It takes 8-12 pounds of plant matter to produce one pound of beef. Universally, if land is able to produce grain for cattle, it can produce edible agriculture. Cattle in feedlots are fed mostly corn, and the ratio goes up. Something like 18 pounds per pound of beef. Land degradation as a result of overgrazing is a serious issue, causing the rapid spread of desert in many countries. This issue is exaggerated by the massive amount of water used to feed cattle and to produce their food. I would argue the exact opposite of your view. At our current rate, the percentage of our diet made up of meats is environmentally unsustainable."
I believe that global vegetarianism/veganism is both economically impossible and ecologically irresponsible. CMV,[deleted],0,"It's not that your argument or view is necessarily wrong, per say, but I think you do make some assumptions about vegans and vegetarians. I think vegetarians as a whole recognize that some meat is sustainable- but not at the level we're at now. Many resources are going into feeding huge herds of animals so that we can have meat with every meal. Vegetarians are combating that, not necessarily with the intent to entirely eliminate, but knowing that they are trying to balance out another extreme- eating meat all the time. If you have two people, one who eats meat too often, and one who eats meat none at all, then a type of balance is achieved. I think vegetarians that do so for the sake of ecological reasons are trying to balance things out, not necessarily eliminate. As well, many people are vegan and vegetarian for ethical purposes. If their claim is valid, then although it would be difficult for the world to be entirely vegetarian/vegan, that extra difficulty may be worth the moral gain. Your post doesn't necessarily refute any moral side to the issue, which many vegans and vegetarians hold to as their primary reason for vegetarianism. So, I don't think your view is necessarily wrong, but it also doesn't necessarily refute vegetarians as well. Does that make sense?"

I haven't been able to find a reliable source for what's done with spent laying hens, but any mention I've found is of them becoming pet food or being discarded, so human consumption is irrelevant there. As long as we still have pets, vegetarian and egg-eating will be an improvement, waste-wise, over meat and egg eating. Removing meat chickens means no waste from crops grown to feed them, no waste produced during their lifespans, and no unusable carcass waste. (Some chicken manure is probably usable, but I'm sure there's still *some* waste.) Cows are trickier. [The data I've found on waste from meat cattle, table 3 at this link,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3614052/) suggests you lose about 25% of a cow. So for every 4 cows you don't slaughter for meat, one dairy cow that is 100% thrown in the garbage would still break even. Ultimately, it will depend a lot on what people replace their meat consumption with. If they move entirely to plant-based options, reducing the total number of livestock, it would probably reduce waste overall. If they eat a lot more eggs and dairy products, I suspect it might still break even, but might not be an improvement. Very interesting question in any case!"

As an extension of that, it's about reducing waste and being ethical consumers. You have described some potential reasons for veganism, not veganism itself. Being vegan is an act/lifestyle in which one doesn't consume or use animal products. Full stop. A person can choose to be vegan for many potential reasons, including (but not limited to) the ones you've listed. &gt;First, is that leather is a byproduct of the meat industry. If everyone were to stop buying leather shoes, then the meat industry would just be disposing of perfectly viable leather. Being able to sell animal skins contributes to the profits of the animal/meat industry, making it more lucrative, and increases demand for more of the animal. Similarly, if I'm a farmer, I would be more likely to grow tomatoes if I could sell the plant's stems as well as the actual tomatoes for extra profit, compared to if I could only sell the tomatoes. A vegan may object to being part of this trade for that reason. &gt; Thus, if vegans desire to reduce waste, then wearing leather shoes is compatible with that lifestyle. Anti-waste is not veganism. A non-vegan can be anti-waste, and a vegan could be indifferent about waste."

This means that if you present someone with a piece of information which seems to contradict that belief, they’re not going to like it very much"""". &gt; Eating meat is a natural, ethical, completely normal thing to do. Most animals eat meat. Some Animals will even torture others for food. Nature is not a good example of moral behavior. By the same logic, is it OK to torture a human for food? Animals do it. Also, in nature, usually if a male wants sex, he'll basically try to rape a female; there's not much concern for consent. We expect different behavior from humans than most animals because humans are capable of considering the effect their actions have on the well-being of others. &gt; It's what'a allowed us to survive and thrive I agree this is a reason to not think killing/eating an animal is wrong in all cases. The most influential moral philosopher right now who advocates vegetarianism is probably Peter Singer, but he doesn't think killing/eating an animal is *intrinsically* wrong. He just thinks it's become easy enough to not eat meat, and factory farms have become so brutal, that deciding to not eat meat is a good decision in our current situation. But he says if he was *really* hungry and had no food available except meat, he'd eat it. &gt; It will never stop the sale of the meat and the deaths of the animals bred to die. Right, but if less people eat meat, less animals will be raised in factory farms and slaughtered for food. Similarly, we can't stop all hunger with our charitable donations, but that's not a reason to stop one person's hunger if we can. And if you can stop someone from murdering another person, does it matter than you can't stop *all* murder? FYI, I'm not a vegetarian.

I hate vegetarians. CMV.,Cramer_Rao,0,"I see two mains points here: 1. That eating meat is good because it has been a successful evolutionary trait. 1. That your individual decision won't affect the meat industry and therefore doesn't matter anyway. I assert that Evolution does not inform morality one way or another. It is 100% amoral (not necessarily immoral). It is a mechanism that weakly selects for successful mutations. As such, I'm not convinced that it can tell us anything meaningful about morals, aside from the fact that within humans the evolution of """"morals"""" seems to have been successful. Unlike every other animal, we have developed the capacity for moral reasoning. Not only have we developed the capacity for moral reasoning, but we've also developed the means to exercise it. There was a time when we were threatened by predators and eating meat served to protect us. We can argue that it was morally right then. There was a time when the addition of calorie dense meat helped our brains grow larger with new specialized regions. We can argue that it was morally right then too. But we've been so incredibly successful that eating meat no longer confers exclusive benefits. We have become so successful that we can afford the luxury of a moral choice. The only unique benefit brought by meat today is that it is uniquely delicious. I'm assuming that there are some meats you won't eat out of principle, and some that you will. I'm certain you wouldn't eat other people, even though cannibalism is a naturally occurring phantom. I'm assuming you wouldn't eat more developed animals like dolphins or chimpanzees. There's a implicit scale we use to regard how developed an organism is. Vegetarians just move the tipping point rather along that others. As for the second point, individually this is true, but in the aggregate it isn't. And this is true for a variety of issues. Unless you are in an unusual position of power, almost no choice you ever make will have an impact on the larger world. If your payoff is the change the world, then it never makes sense to try. This is an equilibrium that it's damn hard to move out of, and the only possible way is to value the individual action itself as well as the impact on the larger world. When the individual action is valued, then there is a chance for an equilibrium where enough people make a choice in order for there to be a difference made.

Things like being swayed by the taste of meat aren't really a concern for me, not contributing to demand for meat products and punishing mistakes/encouraging businesses to take vegetarian choices seriously are the main considerations. It seems like the scenario you have identified is one in which the people/company that served the burger incorrectly have been """"chastised,"""" have provided the customer with the correct order and will be suffering a loss (economically, thought slight, obviously) due to the mistake. With this in mind, this is how I would rank the options, from most to least desirable. I should note that since your scenario takes care of my main concerns (the point of your post) the differences in already arbitrary ethical """"magnitude"""" are quite slight. 1. The meat burger is instead given to someone who does eat meat, offsetting of future/other (presumably partially meat-based) food being the relevant possibility 2. Both the burger and original order are eaten by the vegetarian, assuming no one is aware of the vegetarian's consumption. Though """"better"""" (to the vegetarian) than meals which include meat, vegetarian meals certainly still have a footprint, which can be (again, minutely) alleviated by eating something that would instead be thrown away 3. The burger is thrown away 4. Both the burger and original order are eaten by the vegetarian, assuming people are watching/aware, this being at the bottom because the potential effect on attitudes towards vegetarians would be more damaging than the footprint of the future vegetarian food the burger would have offset. This is obviously arbitrary and impossible to pin down, but as a vegetarian I would be very concerned about legitimizing some strange/hostile biases some people have against vegetarian culture, by displaying a sort of """"hypocrisy"""" on this level in their eyes.

(A) The person who incorrectly provided the burger does not experience negative reinforcement if the burger is not returned. This creates a situation where the mistake can recur. (B) The vegetarian who eats the burger might actually enjoy it. They may enjoy it so much that they will chose to eat meat on purpose. This would create an internal conflict between the impulses a person has and the intention to lead a life which is moral by their own standards.

If you want to talk about the least harm principle, then yes eating that meat in your hypothetical situation wouldn't encourage any more harm to animals. However, in reality if you returned the meat burger you send the message to the employees that they screwed up, and they may be reprimanded for the lost profit by the manager. They will also learn not to make the same mistake and waste meat again, which in effect lowers overall demand of meat by a small amount which leads to less animal suffering. This lowering of demand is minuscule individually, but if the same situation happened to a million people with the same outcome then it would be enough of a lowered demand to make a measurable difference. Now if we go back to your hypothetical situation where the above, real consequences don't matter, whether or not you'd consider eating the burger immoral is based on if you find acts such as necrophilia immoral. The animal is already dead and in front of you, in the same way a corpse may be in front of you. If you eat the burger, or have sex with the human corpse, you're not causing any harm to that animal or human because they are dead.

Secondly, being vegetarian has value as a protest.

"CMV: If an """"ethical vegetarian"""" is served a beef burger instead of a veggie burger by accident, it is more morally permissible to eat it.",huadpe,0,"1. There is some economic effect by demanding the vegetarian option still. If restaurants see that vegetarian options are more in demand, they're more likely to offer more/better options. Restaurants are in general highly responsive to trends in what sells, and dishes that sell a lot will stay on the menu, whereas dishes that don't sell will be ditched. 2. From 1, it may be the case that getting more vegetarian options on the menu will prompt non-vegetarians to eat vegetarian meals by happenstance. If 1/2 the menu is meatless, it's quite likely something they like will just happen to be meatless. 3. Being a vegetarian is a public commitment of sorts. This matters in a restaurant where you're with people you know. Visibly breaking that commitment may make it appear that vegetarianism is harder than it is, and prompt those around you to suggest meat to you more often, or be less likely to become vegetarians themselves."

I don't think being vegan helps animals. CMV.,[deleted],0,"&gt;You feel bad for the animals that are mistreated in facilities Well then what ways can we limit the suffering of these animals? Currently, these factory farms are the only way to produce meat and eggs in a way that can actually meet demand. If you want to end this suffering, you must reduce the market and demand for meat. Once companies realize that treating animals like this is bad for buisness, they're going to try and keep their current customers by raising animals in a way that doesn't make the market cringe. Vegans reduce demand for meat and make it possible and necessary for companies to institute less efficient models of food production."
I don't think being vegan helps animals. CMV.,R88R,0,"I believe that your two examples are incorrect. Dairy cows will only produce milk after gestation and will stop producing milk once their young (or milking machines) stop consuming it much like any other mammal. Yes, they must be milked to prevent discomfort when lactating heavily, but this would stop if you allowed it to trail off. Also, chickens produce far more eggs in hatcheries than they would naturally. I remember on our distant family's farm my family would put 1/2 fake eggs in each chicken's nest. The presence of an egg encouraged them to lay more. In addition, your premise implies that the number of animals in the world is static, but if demand were far lower there would be fewer chickens and dairy cows in these situations to begin with. If you want to take the utilitarian view that these animals have bad lives, then lessening the number of animals would be a way to improve the world."
I don't think being vegan helps animals. CMV.,froggyhog,0,"I'm going to discuss this from a different point of view: Being vegan is more environmentally friendly than being a meat-eater (it takes 10 times as much energy to produce a calorie of meat as compared to a calorie of veggies.).

EDIT: Accidentally hit enter before I finished typing the comment."
I don't think being vegan helps animals. CMV.,WhatIsPants,0,"There is a simple fact that once a dairy cow or laying hen drop below a certain threshold of profitability they become cat food. The calves that dairy cows must be forcefully inseminated with to induce lactation become veal. All these animals are eventually slaughtered just like animals raised explicitly for meat, and from an ethical vegan perspective that makes it no better. The vegan movement will only be satisfied when an animal is allowed to live its full, natural lifespan and I'd love to hear what fraction of companies that we consider to have humane practices respect that principle."
I don't think being vegan helps animals. CMV.,[deleted],0,"By purchasing animal products, we usually perpetuate an industry that requires a certain level of animal suffering in order to continue to turn a profit. Some people believe that if eliminating animal cruelty was our primary concern, we would not support these industries. There are relatively cruelty-free alternatives, like free-range eggs and whatnot. These are almost always more expensive, and by purchasing them we perpetuate a culture where the use of animal products is the norm. So people who don't have as much disposable income will still have strong motive to purchase factory produced eggs and milk. Cruelty-free eggs will never be the norm, because the average person just can't be bothered to care about a fuckin' chicken's welfare if they're worried about paying for rent *and* food this month. Many people believe that the solution is not to convince that person to care about chickens enough to spend twice as much money on eggs, it is to create an environment where animal products don't even enter that person's mind when they're thinking about possible food choices. And to create an environment where companies have strong incentives to come up with plant-based food options to that can take the place of animal products in the general population's diet. For instance, soy milk costs a lot more than cow milk where I live, which I believe is more because companies know that the *can* charge more for it rather than because it costs more to produce. (As I understand it, nobody who rejects honey because it's an animal product should be given the time of day)."
I don't think being vegan helps animals. CMV.,rrunning,0,"I'm not a vegan and I certainly believe that demand for more sustainable animal products would help animals. However, the argument that abstaining from animal products doesn't help seems kind of amateur to me. Of course less demand means less suffering. Less demand means less industrialization means less overproduction means less suffering. It isn't a zero sum game."
I don't think being vegan helps animals. CMV.,Astromachine,0,"To take a different approach. Being vegan dosen't have to directly help animals to be worth something. I think being a vegan is more than just a diet, it is more of a belief system. Take for example the [Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_restrictions_on_the_consumption_of_pork), these people do not abstain from pork because they believe it is helping pigs, they do it because they believe it is immoral or improper. Now, vegans abstain from animal products because they believe it is immoral to exploit sentient animals for their own benifit. They feel it is immoral because they feel guilt knowing they are exploiting another animal, and yes, they may also want to help free animals from exploitation as well. But untimatly, helping animals does not have to be the primary reason to behind choosing to become a vegan."

Hypothetically, you could save the most children by eating the minimum needed to survive and donating everything you have to starving international children.

CMV: I am a hypocrite vegan and therefore should spot being vegan again,yakultbingedrinker,0,"Some arguments for you: If you help beyond the extent that you're happy, it reduces the chance others will follow your example. It's reasonable to only do what you can do 1. *forever* 2. **comfortably**, because in the long run what will change these things is changes in societal priorities, not your individual contributions. What kind of an example would it set if you destroyed yourself contributing all you can in the short term? In all likelyhood it would put people off charity. There's too much wrong in this world for one person to fix, so a line has to be drawn somewhere. There is also the problem that giving people money for having children they can't afford encourages them and others to have more children they can't afford. Not contributing to demand for meat does not encourage cows to kill themselves or something. If you do donate to charity you have to be careful who you donate to. Also surely a person is more responsible for things which they cause than things which they don't? You didn't cause there to be starving children, but if you eat meat etc, you are contributing to demand for meat, thus (on average) causing that demand to be met. You are not, in a fundamental sense, *responsible* to fix things you did not break, unless that happens to be your particular job, or those are people withing your natural sphere of influence/protection. It's good of some people to sacrifice their happiness for others (if that would help- something to be careful of, happiness is a good thing and positive for others as well as yourself), but it's not a person's responsibility to fix endless problems which were broken when they got here, while it is their responsibility to refrain from causing additional harm. (insofar as they are able to without worse consequences. It wouldn't be good to go vegetarian if the stress means you would be an abusive parent or go crazy or something)."
CMV: I am a hypocrite vegan and therefore should spot being vegan again,alschei,0,"I think you have a poor definition of hypocrisy that is at the basis of your concern. Setting high moral standards for yourself, but not always meeting them, isn't being hypocritical. It is being human and it is nothing to be disappointed about. Hypocrisy is when you chastise others for something you fail to do. For example, I think you've presented a sound argument for why *you should not judge others for eating animals or ignoring the poor*. It's important to approach the question """"How much good can you do?"""" from a holistic standpoint of who you are as a person and as part of society. (This is the utilitarian in me!) Consider these scenarios. (Let's assign an arbitrary point system too, of Gud units.) **A)** You are a vegan and are happy. You are doing Good, maybe **1 Gud/yr** for 50 years - so **50 Gud** total. **B)** You decide that to be """"morally consistent"""" you must renounce all earthly possessions, despite the fact that this makes you miserable. You do **10 Gud/yr**, then burn out after a year; become less productive and make less money (less potential to contribute); maybe even kill yourself when faced with the fact that sacrificing everything was not enough to single-handedly save the world. You do **10 Gud** total. In the end you haven't actually made your largest contribution anyway. But we're leaving out a *HUGE* part of the evaluation: we are a social species, and our actions are amplified to be powerful and meaningful when in a group. In scenario **A)**, you do a little bit of Good, and people notice you can be happy and rewarded by doing that. You lead by example. You convince 10 friends to do the same - and maybe they'll convince 10 more friends. Now instead of **1 Gud/yr**, you've contributed **101 Gud/yr** for a total of **5,050 Gud**!. In scenario **B)**, on the other hand, you destroy yourself in order to do more good in the short term, but people will see that you are miserable and will not follow your example; your net impact is still a paltry **10 Gud**. Therefore, though you could be doing a bit more to help the world than you are right now, it is not only morally OKAY, but morally NECESSARY, to keep your own life balanced in order to achieve your maximum contribution to helping others. There's nothing hypocritical or inconsistent about that."

CMV: I am a hypocrite vegan and therefore should spot being vegan again,aRabidGerbil,0,"What you're talking about is very similar to what Australian philosopher Peter Singer argues for in his essay *Famine, Affluence, and Morality*, he also advances the idea that, since people are morally equal we should help them all as much as we can; however there is one big counter to his argument. In order for us to value everyone in the world equally we must place the same emotional value on them, unfortunately the human brain isn't wired that way and we aren't actually capable of placing equal value on everyone. Bob Corbett adds to this fact that """"ought implies can"""", meaning that if there is something we **ought** to do then it must be true that we **can** do it, and inversely, if we can't do something then it is unreasonable to say we ought to do it. So for you, feeling responsible for a child somewhere in the world isn't possible so it would be unreasonable to expect that of you; but it is possible for you to change your diet to reflect your morals so it is reasonable to expect you to do it."

I think that line of reasoning is very flawed. I'm a lacto-ovo vegetarian. I could be vegan or a fruitarian and that may do more good for animals than being lacto-ovo. I guess some people may consider me a hypocrite because, while I go out of my way to support a cause I believe in... I don't go much farther than what is still convenient to me. Still I think it rational to believe that some good is better than no good, even if it's not maximum good. Edit: I've always maintained that vegetarianism doesn't have to be an all or nothing thing. If everyone reduced their consumption of meat by a little, there would be far less strain on the system and I generally think animal welfare would benefit from this (which is a different argument and a complex issue). Because I cannot influence all people, I abstain from all meat and thus offset the 3-5 people who do nothing to reduce their meat consumption.

CMV: I am a hypocrite vegan and therefore should spot being vegan again,One_Winged_Rook,0,"This is just another example of the trolley problem. I would imagine you'd get the same answers. To me, you have no responsibility to anyone who you didn't actively cause them to be in that situation. The mother causes her child to be in her care (through getting pregnant) and hence has the responsibility to care for them. However, for events that you did not directly cause, you have no more obligation to resolve them, for good or ill. In the example of the trolley problem, to me, the correct answer is to just walk away. By doing such, you're not taking anyone's life, you're considering it not your doing and any obstruction could potentially make it worse. In your example, by getting involved in scenarios in which you did nothing to cause, your actions are morally perilous as they could cause ill effects without your intent. And as I am one who only holds people accountable on their outcomes and not their intent, I would say any resulting action of malice on the part of those she intentionally helped save, she is directly morally responsible for them.

Vegans who want regular tofu are free to buy it, I don't see a problem. edited to add: I don't like veggie faux meat products but it is because they are bad - in my opinion they taste neither like meat nor tofu and are highly processed, lots of salt etc. Bleh.

CMV: Vegans should not have indoor pets,dlgn13,0,"Just because something is natural, that doesn't mean it's good. I'm vegetarian for ethical reasons, and I keep a cat. He gets to run about outside when he wishes, and has a warm shelter, constant food and water when he wants those. He also has human companionship, which he appears to enjoy at times. He could be """"free"""" if he wanted to be, but he keeps coming back. Ethical vegans who keep indoor cats clearly believe this is not detrimental to the cat's health and happiness. The first can be shown quite easily: indoor cats live longer than indoor/outdoor cats, who in turn live longer than feral cats. As for the second... &gt;you can clearly tell it's not the natural environment for the cat by how it spends all day longing at the window. Actually, the domestic cat doesn't really have a """"natural environment"""" as such, apart from """"with humans"""". Furthermore, just because the cat wants to go outside, that doesn't mean it's unhappy inside. While I do believe that cats are happier living inside/outside in some situations, there's no reason to believe that they aren't still reasonably content living inside. Last of all, your argument suggests that cats would be happier living """"free"""". But, as I pointed out, in the first paragraph, """"imprisonment"""" comes with a great many comforts. Conversely, feral cats have to deal with many unpleasant things: uncomfortably hot, cold, dry, and wet weather; fights with other cats; predators, including malicious humans; traffic accidents; poisoning; diseases; animal control; lack of good drinking water; and, of course, starvation. Yes, cats enjoy the hunt, but the perks of living with a human can more than make up for that."

They are very likely to die outside from attacks by larger animals and cruel people, eating poisonous chemicals like antifreeze, and from diseases and parasites. 2. Furthermore, they aren't a part of the ecosystem they would be released into, and their hunting skills would allow them to quickly kill many other animals, especially birds. Cats often play with their prey before killing them, so a cat that captures a bird will likely torture it first before eating it.

CMV: Vegans should not have indoor pets,funchy,0,"I think you're projecting what you *think* a domestic cat wants onto the cat. The cat is a domestic animal and is no longer a wild animal. We have shaped it to meet our needs. If you were talking about locking a Bengal tiger in an apartment, everyone would agree with you. But this is a house cat -- an animal we've bred for the purpose of pet/companionship. The properly socialized cat enjoys and seeks out our company. Putting personal opinions aside, let's look at the[ outcomes of an indoor versus outdoor cat.]( http://www.darlenearden.com/articleindoor.htm) Indoor cats live long healthy lives with a life span of 12 to 14+ years out. Outdoor cats average 4 years. Indoor cats are protected from the elements, infectious diseases from other cats, vehicles, or loose dogs. Two incurable and eventually fatal diseases, FIV and FELV, only come from other cats. Indoor cats can be tested and kept in groups, and the cats are healthy. Putting a pet cat outdoors may be convenient for the owner (no litter box) but he may suffer suffer a terrible death and on average he lives less than one third as long. If we use your test of leaving a door open to test for """"captivity"""", what happens when we try this on 2 or 3 year old toddlers? If they wander outside and get hit by a car, can we assume their true nature was that they wanted to be free? And it's better to let someone in our care die a painful slow death young than be protected from dangers they don't understand? By your logic, if we let an animal do something deadly, by holding him back were keeping him prisoner and depriving him from experiences. So if my cat wants to drink some antifreeze I spilled in the garage, I am in the wrong for not letting him? For what it's worth, I don't see what vegan beliefs have to do with anything? All people should be concerned with meeting the basic needs of their pets. Maybe this isn't about cat welfare and perhaps more about you looking for contradictions in vegans behavior?"

CMV: Vegans should not have indoor pets,A_Soporific,0,"Homes are the natural environment of domesticated animals.

Cats are native to houses and backyards. Cows and corn are native to farms. Cats are part of an ancient agreement, they keep our homes and food supplies safe from vermin and we keep them save from larger predators that would otherwise eat them. Few cats live exclusively inside the house, and many of those that do are inside by choice. Natural freedom isn't really a thing. After all you're simply trading one set of rules (those of a house and family) for a different one (those of survival and predation). Just because the limits go from hard (glass) to soft (hunger/thirst) doesn't mean that there are no limits. Man will submit to law in order to gain more autonomy and control that possible otherwise. Cats choose to stay home for similar reasons."
CMV: Vegans should not have indoor pets,VeganDog,0,"Allowing a cat free roam outside is less ethical and terribly irresponsible. Keeping a cat indoors isn't even all about the cat; it's about respect for other people and native wildlife as well. When looking at the life expectancy of an outdoor cat and an indoor cat, which is five years and 13 years respectively, indoor cats reign superior. Outdoor cats are also at risk for afflictions that indoor cats aren't, or aren't nearly as much at least; being ran over by cars, atttacked by humans or animals, being poisoned, picking up diseases, heat or cold related ailments, etc. This makes them more likely to die in suffering, and/or require more frequent vet visits. Looking at it from a persepctive not at the cat's benefit, outdoor cats are nuisance. They urinate and defecate on people's property, spreading diseases or ruining possesions. They may also agitate properly contained outdoor animals such as dogs, rabbits, or chickens. Emotional or safety hazards my also be present with letting cats outdoors; it doesn't feel good to run over someone's cat, and reactionally swerving to avoid someone's pet cat can be dangerous. Finally, cats are also an invasive species. They massacre native wildlife and are responsible for the endagered status of a few species. Who says an indoor cat can't have an enriching life? It doesn't have to be standard. The problem here is cats sit on windows all day because they're chronically bored. Cats need more than just food and a stroke of the back, but so many cat owners don't provide more than that. A vegan with a cat could provide an enriching environment that has multiple cat trees, a variety of toys, and playful interaction rather than affectionate. Let's get on to the final point. 3-4 million cats and dogs are euthanized every year. Why? No one wants to adopt them. What sounds worse to you; dying alone after being stressed and scared in a small cage for days, or life with a vegan who's doing their best to keep them enriched as possible? Cats have been domesticated out of their natural environment. Unless we ship them out to Africa, no matter where we keep them it will be unnatural for them. It's our duty to keep them as safe and as enriched as possible. Keeping them indoors and properly stimulated, along with making sure they do not reproduce, is in their best interests.

They are, naturally, prey animals. They seek shelter. They seek protection. They desire comfort, familiarity, and safety. I have two guinea pigs. I have tried to take them outside on a leash before. They don't like it. They freak out. They don't know where they are and they don't know that they are safe. They cry until I pick them up and take them back inside and put them in their comfortable and safe territory with their comfortable and safe cushions and their food bowls that they know will always be full. They are exceptionally happy there and show no desire to be anywhere else. I think cats, if kept, should be kept in places where they can come and go as they please. I think dogs should have a place where they can run around like a yard or a nearby park. If those things are made available, I think it's fine to keep those pets."

CMV: Vegans should not have indoor pets,dopesmoke,0,"Mankind, unfortunately, has shaped animals into being domicile pets. Most animal experts would encourage cats to be house cats only and not allowed outdoors. It is very likely that an outdoor cat would be hit by a car or injured by another animal. Either of these things may inflict serious lifelong injury on the cat, forever impairing them and possibly leading them into a slow, painful death. This is because our species has shaped them into living indoors therefore it is more difficult for them to adapt and survive in an outdoor environment. I must say that I also commend these people for putting a net around their balcony. Oftentimes cats misperceive how far they are from the ground and attempt to jump from a second story balcony, resulting in serious injury. If humans were no longer allowed to keep animals as pets, two things would happen, first an increase in euthanasia and secondly a mass amount of feral animals, unable to provide for themselves or recognize dangerous situations such as cars. By adopting a domesticated cat, you are saving its life and giving it the safest and healthiest life that it deserves. If not for you adopting it, perhaps it would be euthanized and have no life at all. Also I'd like to point out that just because a cat looks at the window doesn't mean that it is thinking about being outside. You can't even prove that cats have those type of thoughts, they're unable to verbalize it. I would argue that there is something visually stimulating about windows and sunlight.

Let us also examine that humans are omnivorous in nature and only in the last 50 years has technology caught up enough to mass produce enough nuts and high protein/fat sources from non-animals to meet dietary requirements. Most vegans-especially raw vegans-have their teeth rot out if they don't take the correct vitamin supplements. Why would I want that when I can eat meat and have healthier teeth and bones?

I might feel a little evil when I think about what I'm doing, but rationally I know that I would only have to do the equivalent of enslaving around 1 chicken a year to eat 3 eggs a day. According to the above conversion rate, that's equivalent to killing 2 chickens a year. On the other hand, if I eat a chicken dinner every night, I'm doing the equivalent of killing a chicken every 2 or 3 days, or over 120 chickens a year. I run competitively during about half the year, and throughout the year I need to stay on a very particular diet to maintain my physical and mental health for what I do. With my need for protein and other nutrients, it would be effectively impossible for me to be vegan right now. But what I can do is be mindful of what dietary choices I'm making, and if I can get by with only killing 2 or 20 chickens a year instead of 120, then at least I'm making an effort.

I am not one of the ones who think that consumer power is an effective tool though, I believe in direct action. Regarding the argument about animals; we have an abundancy of food. Animals don't, they need to find food on their own every day. We have a huge industry that pumps out enough vegetables to feed everybody on earth, but still we insist on eating meat which is both bad for the environment and our health. Sure, everybody on earth doesn't have easy access to food - but that is a problem related to capitalism and I won't blame an incredibly poor person for eating meat or dairy products. From my point of view, I just don't see why we shouldn't be empathetic towards animals when we have the choice to. Do you have any pets? If you have or ever had, didn't you feel empathetic towards them? Would you want your beloved cat/dog/whatever to be born and raised just to be killed? I don't think it is humane to trap someone and keep them locked up, even if you don't hit them all the time which is basically the norm in slaughterhouses. A lot of the animals bred in slaughterhouses and on dairy farma are also deformed after decades of selective breeding which means that they are suffering just to be alive, which in itself should be enough to want to see the end of the meat industry IMO. A lot of ethical vegans are also anti-capitalism though, and oppose the treatment of the workers you mentioned. Edited a lot of times, I'm on my phone"
I believe vegans and vegetarians who choose their diets for ethical reasons rather than simple taste or health reasons are irrational and misinformed. CMV.,qmynd,0,"tldr; besides moral arguments for being vegan there are also personal benefits. &gt;I think the global poor are far more deserving of attention than the treatment of animals and of you're curious You can help the global poor even better by being vegan and vegetarian. First take a look at the environmental arguments. So one vegan/vegetarian=&gt; better environment=&gt; happier all world including undeveloped. Second vegan/vegetarian is incredibly cheaper. A lot of people bad a being vegan will say this is bs but really meet is expensive as shit and you can find cheap substitutes especially in Asian markets. Now you have more money to spend to help the global poor. &gt;because it's not a cause I care enough about I was the same way before being vegan and I still don't think its obligatory but the cognitive dissonance that eating animal products isn't noticeable until you stop. After stopping eating meet you don't have to worry about what suffering your causing with regards to this because you are doing your best to help a cause. Its much easier to look at your pet or farm animals with out reducing suffering out of there existence. Cows and goats are really beautiful creators. Now this is opinion but after becoming vegan I could really appreciate the calm farm animals have. They don't run about like dogs or people. A lot just peacefully sit there eating grass. Anyways of course you might not experience but being vegan makes one less thing I have to worry about. Second thing is what you learn about your self through sacrifice. Not eating meet or animal products requires self control and patience. You end up learning a lot about nutrition and get better at shopping and making meals. As a vegan, A lot of really unheathy quick and easy meals are now out of the option. So you learn to cook and you learn to cook fast. Now you can make good tasting, healthy, gormehish meals and not fuss about all the work it takes. Final thing is you learn a lot about the way people think and how to talk to them. Biggest thing about being a vegan is all the people who want to shot you down out of insecurity. Not a lot of people are insecure about eating meat but there are enough you will have many intense conversations with people about it and if you fail in to their anger and fight back with them the situation goes nowhere.

There are currently millions of vegetarians, so are you going to honestly propose to me that if every one of those individuals all of a sudden accepted your reasoning here and started eating meat again, that this would have no effect on demand? This is obviously untrue. What this also means is that the individual's effect on demand is not zero, because if it were zero, you would multiply the total number of vegetarians by zero to find what the effect would be if they all started eating meat, which is obviously not zero. So what it is *actually* accurate to say is that the effect of one individual is somewhat small. It is is an effect nonetheless though, and if you'd ever looked up the statistics on how many entire animals the average human eats in their lifetime, you'd realize that it is much larger than you probably think. &gt; nobody has a problem with that animal killing and eating another animal There are a number of things wrong with this as well. The first being: since when do you take your cues for how to act appropriately from *wild animals*? You know what, wild animals rape each other all the time. In light of this, am I now going to hear you argue that we should be fine with rape too, """"because animals do it""""? This line of argument is an appeal to nature fallacy, because it acts like just because something is natural, it is *good* for us to do. We don't base our actions and standards on how wild animals act. The next problem is pretty much exactly what you said: animals are generally not moral agents because they don't have a conception of morality. We *do* however, so pointing to an amoral agent can do nothing to inform us, as moral agents, how we should act. That's the equivalent of pointing to a sociopath and going """"Well *he* doesn't have a problem with serial killing, so *I* shouldn't either!"""" &gt; I don't buy that dying equates to suffering. The main argument is about how animals are treated prior to their death, and considering that essentially all meat produced comes from factory farms, this is what matters. The amount of meat produced by small mom and pop farms would not feed the population of long island alone, so their existence is essentially negligible when trying to determine how one should act in the real world, even if it were granted that this was an acceptable source (which is questionable in itself). The animals produced by these factory farms endure unfathomable levels of suffering, and every time you pay the farm for their services, you encourage more of it. You are getting your meat from the people who torture animals for nearly their whole lives, and this is what is argued to be the primary ethical problem."

CMV.,anriana,0,"It's interesting that you mention the global poor as more important than animals. I don't disagree with you, but these issues intersect more than you would think. Indigenous peoples in South America are losing their lands so that more beef can be produced for developing countries. Cultural shifts in developing countries (China, India and Egypt come to mind) have led to an increased demand for meat and the upper/middle classes take away resources/land/food from the lower classes via meat consumption. Further, the US meat industry has supported the corn industry for decades, and America's international push for corn/grain consumption has had devastating consequences for the international poor.

CMV.,IceRollMenu2,0,"If I got that right, your first point is: a) Boycott doesn't work if it's sparse. Only few people are vegetarians, therefore their boycott doesn't work. That may be partly true. But a vegetarian might say, well that's *all the more reason* for more people to be vegetarians. It's because of you meat eaters that our boycott doesn't have the optimal effect, so help us and we can minimize animal suffering together! b) Then you slightly change focus. You almost make a whole discussion all by yourself, which goes something like this: - A: Lions kill for meat, therefore it can't be wrong! - B: But the lion *needs to*, which we don't. That's why he's not wrong in killing for food, but we are. - A: But take omnivores, like raccoons or hedgehogs! They kill for food although they don't *need to*, and we don't judge them for it. - B: But they, just like the lion, can't *decide* on what to do and reason ethically about their decision. That's why they are not wrong in killing for food, but we are. Then you present another argument against B (the homeless example), but I fail to see how it justifies killing for food. Can you explain what you had in mind there? Because I find B's answer convincing. c) And then your last paragraph is a bit of a mess. Many people *would* say you shouldn't buy Nike shoes if they're made by children, or if labor conditions are bad. And I'm pretty sure most people *would* say that a harm has been done to you when they just shoot you in the head. In fact, let's think about a similar example. Do you think it's morally OK to shoot someone in their sleep? I assume no, otherwise you are a very dangerous person. Death is a harm to anyone who enjoys their life. And I fail to see why a cow or a pig would be exempt of this rule. If on the other hand you grant that death is a harm to non-humans too, then I think you lack justification to carelessly inflict great harm on others for the sake of your comparably small enjoyment.

In the wild, animals that hunt to kill (and human hunters, for that matter) are concerned with making the quickest and cleanest kill they are capable of. Modern meat production, in practice, is not concerned with this, and makes the life of the animal a living hell by consequence of mass production.

I believe vegans and vegetarians who choose their diets for ethical reasons rather than simple taste or health reasons are irrational and misinformed. CMV.,fludru,0,"Others have addressed problems with several of your points, so I'll leave those myself, but I feel you have omitted a significant point in favor of vegetarianism: environmentalism and world hunger. (Disclaimer, I'm not personally vegetarian, though I eat a 'flexitarian' diet with many vegetarian dishes.) A pound of grain can be fed directly to a person, or that pound of grain can be fed to an animal that we raise for food. The latter creates a major loss: 13 pounds of grain are needed to result in 1 pound of meat. On a worldwide scale, there's only so much land that can be used to raise food. Given that, and given that humans have insufficient food to feed their populations, does it make sense (from a humanitarian standpoint) to divert some of that food to raise other kinds of food, because we like the taste of that food better? Is taking less of a limited resource than you can, but still getting what you need, a good choice, ethically speaking? Granted, it's not an immediate turnover -- most people wouldn't want to live on some things we use as animal fodder if they had a choice -- but the ~30% of world agricultural land used for animal fodder could be re-used for all kinds of different agricultural products, including those that provide protein as meat does (like soy). This does have real-world impacts in developing nations, where it can become more profitable to raise fodder or meat for export than to feed the native populations. Our meat-eating demand, especially in the West, is a driver for this phenomenon. While your individual demand is limited, of course, the typical meat eater consumes 270 pounds of meat per year -- or about 3,500 pounds of animal fodder, indirectly. Multiply that by the Gallup-estimated 5% of Americans (let alone other countries) that are vegetarians, and that's an awful lot of consumption decrease. Now, you could certainly argue that vegetarianism won't fix world hunger, and I won't disagree with that -- there are major political stumbling blocks to getting food where it needs to go in many parts of the world, for example. And yes, the individual impact is small, especially on a global scale. Nonetheless, if someone said """"I think it's unethical to waste perfectly good food"""" and gives some canned goods they don't want to a food bank, I wouldn't consider that irrational -- even if it's a small impact and even if it doesn't fix systemic problems. Vegetarianism, or even decreased meat consumption, could apply the same reasoning. I mean, if I volunteer or give money to charity, anything I can do as an individual is pretty small on a global scale, but that doesn't make it not worth doing, nor that the collective individual actions of a group of people can't sum up to a significant amount. There are also lots of other environmental issues (e.g. deforestation, water shortages, pollution) that make eating less or no meat attractive to people concerned about those issues."

One person may not save any animals by being vegetarian, but if say 1/3 of the population went vegan, we would reduce the number of animals being raised and killed. It's the same reason that we still vote even though one vote won't change the outcome of an election, but if many people vote then it will. 2. It's true that we are more intelligent than animals (although some of them are pretty smart too) but the same applies to children, or mentally handicapped people. Would you think it's ok for an intelligent and cognitively able person to kill a child or a person who is of less than average intelligence? Since we alone have the ability to empathize and recognize the suffering of other beings, shouldn't that be more of a reason for us to NOT kill animals, as opposed to lions who are not able to recognize the suffering of their prey or the value of life? 3. There are animals who are raised humanely, but the majority is still raised in factory farms and are certainly suffering. Just because we can not eliminate *all* suffering on earth, doesn't mean we can't start somewhere.

I believe vegans and vegetarians who choose their diets for ethical reasons rather than simple taste or health reasons are irrational and misinformed. CMV.,paladin_blake,0,"I'm not the president of vegetarianism so I hardly claim to speak for anyone but myself, but as a non-religious ethical vegetarian I feel compelled to respond to this post. Your main arguments seem to me to be that: individual action (via consumer choice) does not make a difference; it is natural to eat meat; humans suffer in the world (and that should be a higher priority); and that killing an animal does not necessarily equate to suffering. I'll try to address each and all of these, in order. 1. I believe that individual actions in the form of shopping behaviors *do* make a difference. The plural of individual action eventually becomes """"trend"""" and it's that sort of data that food producers and grocery stores respond to. [Meat consumption is down](http://www.researchscape.com/health/meat-consumption-trends) in the US (where I live), and that is at least partly attributable to vegetarianism and other reduced-meat diets. I can say from experience that it is significantly easier to be vegetarian now than it was 10 years ago when I started - Chipotle now offers tofu, Burger King has a veggie burger, grocery stores have larger and more robust vegetarian areas. If you believe capitalism works, which I do, then you'll understand the power of consumers to dictate market trends. Businesses go where the money is, and if the money is in organic or vegetarian meals, they'll be there. 2. Regarding the """"natural"""" argument, I would argue that it's pretty irrelevant. It's an [is-ought problem](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Hume's_law). Just because we (as in animals in general) have natural dispositions or proclivities toward eating meat doesn't mean it is necessarily moral to do so. Given that we have the capability to reason, we have a moral obligation to act in accordance with our reason. As for animal morality, I suppose that would depend on whether or not animals are capable of making higher-level moral decisions. I do believe that animals are more intelligent than most people give them credit for, but that doesn't necessarily translate into self-awareness or higher-level cognition. I would say that, in an absolute sense, a lion killing a gazelle is an immoral act, but unless that lion is capable of pondering its actions, it is essentially blameless. 3. As for human suffering, I think this is not an argument against vegetarianism at all. It's entirely possible to avoid buying leather shoes while at the same time also avoiding sweatshop labor shoes. It's entirely possible to feed starving individuals and nations with vegetarian diets (in fact, it may be more beneficial to do so). There's no law that says that vegetarians have to be blind to human suffering. 4. As for the specific moral argument for vegetarianism, there are a few and I don't really know what your moral belief structure is, so any appeal I make will be essentially a shot in the dark as to whether you buy it. I encourage you to read up [here](http://puffin.creighton.edu/phil/stephens/fiveargumentsforvegetarianism.htm) and see which one you feel most drawn to and then find the initial source. That said, I'll make the argument that influenced my decision, which is simple probability. Say you're in a room with a door on both your left and your right, a desk with 2 buttons on it and a speaker overhead. The speaker comes on and a person tells you that the 2 doors lead to different possibilities. If you press the left button, the left door will unlock and you'll have to sit in an uncomfortable chair for 2 minutes, at which point you will be free to leave. If you press the right button, the right door will unlock and you'll have the option to sit in a comfortable chair for 2 minutes, at which point you're free to leave. However, if you press the right button there is a nonzero chance that you'll detonate a nuclear warhead somewhere in the world. You don't know where it will be or what the probability of that detonation are, but you know it's a possibility. I would argue that it's immoral to press the right button, because even though you'll be slightly convenienced, there is a chance that you'll act in a way that's very immoral. Eating meat, to me, is pressing the button on the right (I know it's hyperbolic, it's an example). There is a chance that the way I'm acting by eating meat is immoral, and there's relatively little risk to me in simply avoiding that possibility entirely."

To allow animals to be raised in sometimes appalling conditions, cramped spacing, close proximity to other's of the same species; must cause distress. If some animals such as pets can show behaviorally distress in such situations (my cat has a shit fit when approached by anything that isn't the next door neighbors dog,) it must be mentally damaging for the meat farmed animals, alongside the pecking biting and scratching each other in such a small space. Finally, if children/babies were raised in cages and reared on a strict diet - there would be a public outcry, I personally see no difference between animals or humans so the meat industry simply disgusts me."

CMV: Veganism is a slippery slope towards sacrificing a 1st world lifestyle.,guebja,0,"In Aristotelian [virtue ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics), there's something called the [golden mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_\(philosophy\)), which is the balanced center between excess and deficiency of moral virtues. Now, the idea of excessive virtue might seem counter-intuitive, but when you look at specific examples, it quickly starts making sense: * Courage might be a virtue, yet an excess of courage quickly devolves into recklessness. * Generosity might be a virtue, but in excess it becomes wastefulness. * Honesty might be a virtue, but an excess of honesty is mere bluntness. * Kindness might be a virtue, but in excess it turns into weakness. And the same holds true for benevolence and charity, which are relevant to your CMV. When it comes to benevolence, becoming vegetarian or vegan is a relatively small sacrifice to prevent a relatively large amount of suffering. Yet taking benevolence (towards animals) to its limits, such as not walking around for fear of stepping on ants or not rolling over in bed because a dust mite might get crushed, clearly strays well past any reasonable balance. Likewise, giving to charity in order to help the less fortunate is clearly virtuous. Yet when you do it to the extent that it requires you to give up a reasonable lifestyle, it turns into prodigality and insensibility. Or, to put it differently: &gt; If limiting suffering is the goal It is not *the* goal, but *a* goal.

But, it sounds like we can completely take veganism out of this discussion, I feel like it's a red herring. You're really arguing that the """"unwillingness to sacrifice the creature comforts of a 1st world lifestyle to lessen human suffering must also be unethical"""".

It's something anyone can do, and the more people who partake, the greater the reduction in suffering. Why should this make one feel inadequete? But if we require those who make a realistically acheivable reduction in suffering to do a """"better"""" job at it (and wouldn't giving up all one's possessions cause a person to suffer?), almost no one will do it, and more suffering will be allowed just because """"why should be bother anyway"""". --------------------- The above stands on its own, but if we want to put veganism back into the discussion, then I would say a goal of veganism is absolutely to *redefine* what a first-world lifestyle is. I can't speak for every vegan, but of the many things loved by those who are vegan for ethical reasons include: * reducing the amount of animal products consumed by society * increasing production of renewable energy and decreasing dependence on non-renewables (especially coal) * reducing waste (e.g. conserving power, getting rid of plastic bags at grocery stores, cooking at home rather than eating out to reduce packaging waste, etc.) * supporting businesses that treat their workforces and environments ethically, even if that means the cost of goods get more expensive All of the above would certainly change what a first world lifestyle looks like, but it would in no way require its dismantling."

We can have a debate on how far you should go, but I would argue that it is clearly immoral to not do anything about the staving children in the third world because you don't want to sacrifice your daily starbucks. If it is about how far you should go, veganism is probably less of a shift than living solely to maximize the amount you can donate to charity. The bulk of it is just not eating meat/cheese/eggs, and that's not too difficult after a month or so. People's cravings adjust to their habits rather quickly."

CMV: Veganism is a slippery slope towards sacrificing a 1st world lifestyle.,GiantSpaceTiger,0,"Why exactly is it a slippery slope? I think you have added momentum to the system artificially. To get from the vegan principle: """"contributing to animal suffering is a bad thing"""" ..to your supposedly equal and naturally following standpoint of: """"One should actively seek to reduce human and animal suffering"""" ..requires you to take several intervening steps, which do not naturally proceed from one another in a way which maintains an equivalence between the steps, let alone an equivalence between the start and end points. 1.) Expand """"contributing to animal suffering is a bad thing"""" to """"animal suffering is a bad thing"""". At this point you have changed the principle from opposition to a *specific* wrong *action* into opposition to an abstract concept, which is already a large and meaningful change when in in practical terms. Changing from a specific to a general is what's happening here, and from an action to an abstract. Whilst you are correct that veganism is predicated on a distaste for animal suffering, the specific tenet of veganism is to *not contribute* to animal suffering. There is no inherent necessity for the principle to expand beyond the specific. 2.) Expand """"animal suffering is a bad thing"""" to """"suffering is a bad thing"""". That is a big leap, and something which not every vegan need agree with. It is not necessary to believe that *all* suffering is a bad thing in order to believe that *animal* suffering is a bad thing, so your slope fails to be a slope at this stage, rather it is an optional step at this point. 3.) *Leap* from """"suffering is a bad thing"""" to """"I must actively seek to reduce suffering"""". This is more a leap than a step, and again does not necessarily follow. One may acknowledge the undesirability of suffering without assuming responsibility for ending it, and there is a perfectly valid middle ground of pledging to neither increase suffering nor reduce it, but simply to not be personally responsible for any input into the equation. Some vegans *may* hold the view that """"all suffering is bad"""", but they *need not* hold that view in order to hold the view that """"animal suffering is bad"""". There is no hypocrisy there. Some vegans *may* hold the view that """"all suffering is bad"""", but they *need not* take the view that it is their moral obligation to actively seek to reduce it. This viewpoint is still entirely non-contradictory with """"personally contributing to an increase in animal suffering is a bad thing"""" so again there is no hypocrisy. You have drawn a false equivalence between your arguments by failing to ensure equivalence at every step of the transformation between one and the other."

I also agree that a diet that isn't natural shouldn't push itself as a natural diet for obvious reasons. However, if you are saying we should/ought to do what is natural, I believe that is a dangerous ethical path and I really think it is the crux of your argument. If instead, you believe we should eat what is healthy, then there is plenty of evidence that a vegetarian or vegan diet is just as healthy, if not more so, than a meat-eating diet [(here are just a few studies)](http://scholar.google.co.nz/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=heart+disease+vegan+vegetarian&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C5http://scholar.google.co.nz/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=heart+disease+vegan+vegetarian&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C5).

A vegan diet that requires supplements is neither natural nor healthy. CMV.,simonlorax,0,"I think your argument hinges on the word natural, which in my opinion is completely meaningless.

If dinosaur--&gt;millions of years--&gt;crude oil--&gt;processed into plastics, where along this process does the product become """"unnatural""""? Because plastics are surely not natural right? Anyways that's a huge digression but an example I like to cite. There are many seemingly natural things that are unhealthy, immoral, etc. Natural does not equal inherently good in any way. Having a diet that is """"unnatural"""" because it includes supplements is in no way hypocritical because this argument hinges on a concrete definition of natural that is unbackable by logic or argument, i.e. nonexistent. Okay that is a bit harsh. Sorry I'm getting worked up. But even if you come up with some definition for """"natural,"""" it is meaningless. It's a label that does not get at any substance of morality or health or environmental sustainability etc. Anyways I think that got way off track but hopefully it makes sense and is kind of applicable. Maybe not. Basically I don't think the """"unnaturalness"""" of supplements in a vegan diet is an actual argument against them as I hope I've shown above. As for the unhealthiness of this diet- I am vegan (mostly, my diet is complicated in that I do raise my own chickens for eggs but besides that I am vegan) because veganism is widely accepted to be one of the absolute best things you can do for the environment. That may spark a lot of controversy but having read books upon books on this issue it is something I've found. Obviously its more complicated than that simple statement and there are ways to produce animal products that are less environmentally harmful than most but I won't get into that because I'm digressing again. Anyways, I agree with you that supplementing certain nutrients is not as healthy as getting them actually in your foods. This is defensible by scientific study, not that I've actually read any studies on the matter but theoretically it could be factually proven. **Still, I am okay with my body being slightly less healthy if it means supporting something I believe is right for the future of the planet.**"

A vegan diet that requires supplements is neither natural nor healthy. CMV.,niaiserie,0,"&gt; If a diet requires anything other than the food it prescribes to provide for human dietary needs, it is flawed. The human diet nearly always includes things that aren't food *per se*, eg, dirt and bacteria. We're lucky we eat some of these non-food items. Many bacteria are good for the microbiome and some produce vitamin B12, which is otherwise hard to get (especially for vegans). There is no perfect or """"natural"""" human diet. It's not like humanity was born with a single, simple recipe; everyone's energy and nutrient requirements are unique to the individual. The individual's recipe is determined by a variety of factors including genes and metabolic efficiency. That said, there are also no """"flawed"""" human diets. There are incomplete diets, which is I think what you mean. I think you mean a flawed diet is one that doesn't meet energy and nutrient needs. Even then, there is literature suggesting caloric restriction (to 60% to 70% of calorie needs) can be beneficial in that it's related to longer life (at least in animal studies I've reviewed). &gt; ... vitamin B12 is not found in plants Vitamin B12 is found in some plants. Seaweed is a popularly noted source. Note also the bacteria on those dirty plants which produce B12. &gt; There are also potential issues with protein, iron, calcium, etc. Potential issues, maybe. Inherent issues? No. The onus is on the vegan to educate themselves and consume foods high in these key nutrients and minerals. It can be relatively easy to get enough of these things. &gt;A vegan diet that requires supplements is neither natural nor healthy. and &gt; need to take this pill, too. Who says vegans require dietary supplements? Whoever said that to you is lying through their teeth to market and sell supplements. The vegan diet does not require supplements. Regarding supplements: I'm familiar with how they are regulated and agree it's a messy system. We the people voted to make it that messy as a result of stuff like media campaigns which warned you'd have to get a prescription for your vitamin C supplement. A vegan can be healthy without supplements. There is increasing evidence dietary supplements are useless, if not potentially detrimental to health (especially antioxidant supplements). Dietary supplements are only natural or unnatural in that they're derived from foods (natural) or they're synthesized in a lab (artificial)."

Only bacteria and archaea have the enzymes required for its biosynthesis.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12) Humans can """"naturally"""" obtain B12 the same way that cows, pigs, horses, elephants, and gorillas obtain B12, by eating unwashed plants. The only reason that people who eat meat obtain B12 from that meat is because the cows and pigs eat unwashed plants. A vegan most likely will take a B12 supplement, but not because s/he *has* to; rather because it's more pleasant than mouthfuls of dirt. The same reasoning is used with Vitamin D supplements in milk products. We don't *need* Vitamin D supplements, but sometimes it's easier to take a supplement than to sit outside in the winter for 3 hours to get enough sunlight. For protein, iron, calcium, etc, vegans can obtain these nutrients the same way that gorillas obtain them, in plants. These are literally no issue whatsoever. For example, [broccoli has protein (9 amino acids) 2g per 70g - or about 8g per 100 calories](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2816/2).

When evaluating the merits of meat, understand that animals don't produce b12. Bacteria does. It can be in soil, bacteria in animals guts, some seaweed, and mushrooms. Your general objection to supplements is understandable, but I think what you object to is *how* people use them. This would be fixed by educating people and perhaps changing how supplements are regulated/marketed. It doesn't mean all are bad. B12 is a single ingredient supplement and the mcg content of a b12 pill is posted. B12 does have established recommended daily allowance, and there is an observable result (pernicious anemia) that will occur if levels are too low.

American diets are already heavily supplemented. You think sugary overly processed cereal naturally and miraculously contains all those vitamins and minerals? Or bread? Or milk even? The USDA's prime purpose at its creation was to prevent nutritional deficiencies. It did this through supplementation, which, while not perfect, has helped almost eliminate many deficiencies in the population. So if you're anti-supplements, better throw out pretty much anything in a box. 2) Just because humans DID eat a certain way and CAN eat a certain way, doesn't mean it's the healthiest way. Evolution is not a sentient mechanism. If you can live to reproduce (which could happen in your teen years) then congratulations! Your genes got passed on! We may have evolved to eat animal products because we needed the caloric density to grow to reproductive maturity, but that says absolutely NOTHING about whether meat in a diet is the best predictor for longevity. This is my biggest pet peeve with paleo. We live in a world where we CAN get enough calories from a plant-based diet, we don't have to resort to meat.

In that light, it is impossible for unintelligent creatures to have moral responsibilities, but this does not preclude the idea of moral rights. If you don't buy that argument, acknowledge that humans have the ethical responsibility to minimize pain for creatures that can feel pain. This is a huge simplification, but I doubt very many people would disagree with this one. I consider it a postulate of ethics. Thus, we at least have the responsibility of following this guideline. I do not draw such a distinction as Rothbard does when acknowledging human babies' rights because they will eventually be humans. Human babies are a specific group and have never petitioned for their own rights while they are a member of that group. Adult humans do that *on behalf of* the other group, human babies. In the same way, adult humans petition for the rights of many other groups, including animals. They derive the existence of these animal rights through the human responsibility of minimizing pain, and for many other more complex reasons case-by-case, I'm sure. Regarding your point about arguments for animal rights appealing to emotion: It is also the case that people appeal to creatures which can feel pain. For example, it is known that cats, apes, and dogs feel pain. It is known that many insects, such as beetles, do not, because most insect nervous systems are movement-only. I, personally, primarily derive animal rights through this example. It is wrong to make a living being suffer. Suffering involving pain is a lot worse than suffering without pain (which is hard to even define in primitive creatures). But I think this is a good framework to justify animal rights for more advanced animals over more primitive ones."

CMV: I think there is no rational moral justification for animal rights as a moral issue,videoninja,0,"In my view, morals tend to be a relative thing depending on context. That being said, I usually imagine that the people who believe in animal rights tend to do so through a tenet of """"Don't be a dick."""" In some ways, it can be a pretty consistent philosophy if you apply it to animals. They can clearly feel pain and many animals display levels of emotional complexity. Animals can't petition for their rights because we're the ones setting the standard. If an elephant tries to make a break for freedom from a zoo, we put it down instead of letting it advocate for its freedom. It's not exactly a great analogy and is basically saying """"because we animals can't be human, they are not beholden to protection from cruel behavior."""" We as humans wield immense power and authority over our world. That we use that power to subjugate and commit unnecessary atrocities to another living thing could be read as morally unacceptable. Those with power should wield it responsibly. There are animal rights believers who eat meat but believe we shouldn't treat livestock animals the way we do (and I don't think it's the most unreasonable stance). Admittedly, though, I'm a little unclear on why you are opposed to people treating animals with respect? Certainly there are extremists but in my experience the run of the mill animal rights stance is we shouldn't be unnecessarily cruel to animals. To address your point, not all animals are going to be able to communicate with us or demonstrate emotional complexity but there are certainly species that do (elephants, dolphins, apes, even dogs). In fact, many animals are demonstrably smarter than children (under the age of 3-5 years old depending on your source). Given that, there's surely some level of gray area to be acknowledged here. Still, before I can say anything more, I just kind of need an abridged version of why you ultimately feel I should always prioritize people over animals. As a sidenote, I can say this much: my friends' dogs would mean more to me than a stranger. Relationships and connections don't exist inside some sort of emotional and circumstantial vacuum. Those dogs have a relationship with me and communicate when they want to eat, play, go out, or relax. I have an emotional investment over them more than a stranger. Likewise, I'm going to save my friend over a random dog."

CMV: I think there is no rational moral justification for animal rights as a moral issue,CultofNeurisis,0,"&gt; Making an argument simply because they are alive should include plants and bacteria in lifeforms needing moral protection. It comes down to, in my opinion, that yes, it is about things that are living. However, first and foremost is our own survival. It is not possible to not kill anything that is living and remain healthy. Because of that, it becomes choosing the lesser of all evils. If you were to kick a dog as hard as you can, and kick an apple as hard as you can, I think you would feel more bad about kicking the dog. Even if you wouldn't, you would feel more *something* about kicking the dog even just because the dog is responding to you kicking it. Following that analogy, even though it would be optimal to not harm any bacteria or plants too, we simply have to eat some things, and therefore, based on emotions and observation, the lesser of the evils is to exempt animals from things that should be eaten. We can not only see the pain in animals, we can empathize. Plants and bacteria we can prove they respond, but often not as visibly, and certainly do not evoke as much empathy."

CMV: I think there is no rational moral justification for animal rights as a moral issue,JizzCat,0,"I think other posts have covered some important ground, so this won't be comprehensive though some of it might have already been said. **First** - You argue that the problem with arguments from intelligence and suffering are they exclude certain groups of humans. Yet, earlier you seem to suggest that a basic prerequisite to moral rights and responsibilities is that the entity must """"be able to understand what morality is."""" Why doesn’t your standard suffer the same problem? Those in a coma, the severely mentally disabled, etc. often do not understand moral rules. I anticipate your response to be that the latter groups are at least part of a species that can understand morality. But why does being a human matter in the first place? We usually try not to discriminate based on designations arbitrarily assigned at birth (race, gender, sexuality, etc.) I think any answer to the question poses problems for your position. Is it because humans are smarter? Then what do we do with humans that are not smart? Is it because humans can understand morality? Then that's circular. And so on. Thus, I think you present a weakened version of the arguments from intelligence and suffering. Their point, as I understand them, is not to establish baseline standards from which rights spring. Rather, they show the inability of such standards to exclude animals from consideration, or they show that those standards collapse on themselves. **Second** – I think the way you've posed the problem seems circular. In essence, you point to vague conceptions of morality and rights that are human centered, and then say because non-humans don't meet these standards they deserve little consideration. Your Rothbard quote is the best example of this maneuver. But why is anthropocentrism the basis of morality? The statements you make in the second paragraph are just as much a reason to rethink the concepts of rights and morality in a world that extends so far beyond the human and has for a very, very long time. **Third** – Related to the second point, what is morality? And what are rights? Both of these are assumed but not explored in your post. **A** - Do animals have the right to not be slaughtered or mutilated cruelly and wantonly? Do pregnant pigs (as smart as three year old humans) have the right to cages with enough that let them turn around? I think so, on both accounts. You may try to paint this as simply an appeal to emotion, but I beg to differ. You would have to be totally shut off from the reality of animal agriculture to understand the banality of its mass cruelty. The point is – what “rights” are and mean matters. If rights are just """"the right to be silent"""" or """"the right to a speedy trial"""" then obviously animal rights is a weird concept, but that is an impoverished way of approaching the question. **B** – Is understanding morality having an abstract set of principles or is it acting morally? If I stop someone from drowning, or if I cooperate with rather than destroy a partner, then I think it’s a moral action, born from an understanding of morality, regardless of whether I calculate the utilitarian or deontological value of doing so beforehand. Obviously animals don't know what utilitarianism is, but I think they do *act morally*. I could point to a lot of sources for this point, but [here's one](http://books.google.com/books?id=q7FIcsd5Qz4C&amp;dq=the+moral+lives+of+animals&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s) Further, moral systems, even among humans, are not given across time and space. Some moral theories are based on similarity – you are like me, therefore you deserve consideration. Others are based on difference – I recognize you are different from me and that difference is valuable. The latter system calls into question the schema of your argument, which I think heavily relies on the former. *Edit for small formatting error"

"I am anthropocentric, meaning that my end goal in life is the well-being of humanity, and this should not be slowed down by animal rights. CMV",DavidByron,0,"Firstly some animal rights do contribute to the well-being of humans. Much like there are laws against desecrating corpses, so there are many laws against hurting animals which have the intention of preventing anti-social behaviour by people. People who are cruel to animals are usually also cruel to people and cruelty to animals desensitises people to cruelty to people. Secondly there are many humans who (on the basis of the difference between animals and humans that you have chosen) are no better than animals, and in fact probably worse. Plenty of brain damaged, comatose or otherwise incapacitated people out there who are nevertheless given rights. In part this is because bothering to treat them worse in law would tend to establish a poor precedent challenging the sanctity of human life (similar to the point above). Thirdly because we're not sure that animals (at least some small number of them) are all that different to humans. Certainly all the points that *you* made would be exhibited in one animal or another. There are differences that remain, but since so many of those differences have been swept aside (again for some species) in recent decades it's obviously not a good argument to say, """"We don't know for sure that animals experience X, so they don't"""". So there's an element of doubt (or if you seriously want to define personhood by only the criteria you named then there's really no doubt and you're just wrong, but I assume you have other criteria you didn't bother to mention). if there's an element of doubt that suggests some rights for animals ought to be considered."

Well, I would be quite upset to come across someone torturing a cat, say, but I'd not care if the same person was instead burning ants with a magnifying glass. No matter what *post hoc* justifications I try to think of for this it just comes down to empathy: I have quite a lot for people and pets, some for other animals, and none for many more. I think you do touch on some of why certain animals elicit more empathy than others. You mention about animals not having dreams and aspirations and a drive towards self-actualization like *humans can*. That's the important bit at the end, there: the more intelligent - and therefore more human-like - the animal is, the more empathy we have for it. For deciding on appropriate treatment and rights of animals (a classification that includes humans, remember) I think it would be a mistake to just divide them all into human and non-human, and treat everything from microscopic waterbears to social non-human primates alike. Consider for example the [mirror test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test), an experiment designed to determine whether or not the subject is able to recognize an image in a mirror as themselves. For humans, children typically start to recognize their reflection as themselves between about [15 to 18 months](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_stage) old. It is theorized that being able to figure out that your reflection represents yourself indicates that you have self-awareness; to recognize your reflection as yourself you must first be aware of yourself. The interesting thing about this is that some animals are capable of passing the mirror test and therefore are thought to have some concept of self. All great apes (including humans) can pass, as can dolphins, orcas, elephants, and magpies. It is very tempting and easy to draw very hard lines between different species, but evolution shows us that the truth is much stranger and that we are closely related to some animals and can have a great deal of similarities with them. For others that we are less closely related to, the defining feature of our species, our intelligence, can still sometimes be seen to a degree, such as in [octopuses](http://io9.com/5858783/the-growing-evidence-for-octopus-intelligence) which are smart enough to be considered 'honourary vertebrates' for purposes of experimental ethics. To be clear, I'm not saying that there are animals that should have the full range of human rights. But, if we look at our reasons for feeling empathy for other humans and for treating each other well, we'll find that at least some of this reasoning applies to some extant to certain animals, and for that reason they deserve some amount of our empathy and compassion as well."

I would dispute this in three ways. A) Acknowledgement of animal capabilities. This is a direct challenge to your assertion that animal's are incapable of reaching the higher levels of Maslow's Hierarchy. The chart in your link lists the following characteristics of self-actualization: [morality](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/wildlife/9801946/Chimpanzees-have-sense-of-fairness.html] ), [creativity](http://www.elephantart.com/catalog/index.php/cPath/69), [spontaneity](http://www.livescience.com/1532-farfetched-hint-free-fly.html), [problem solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_use_by_animals), [lack of prejudice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism_in_animals), and [acceptance of facts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance). In each of these links, I have provided an example of an animal displaying that trait, or of human's failing to (acceptance of facts). B) Comparison to other humans of lesser intelligence. I grant your point that animals are incapable of several of the mental abilities that humans have (essentially, abstract thought), and that we are superior to them (though even that could be argued in certain aspects). But if mental superiority is your entire reason for declaring them undeserving of rights, does that same reasoning extend to people with reduced mental capacity? Should you be able to end the life of someone who is severely mentally disabled (specifically, to the point that they are incapable of higher thought), so you can harvest their organs to give to """"normal"""" people? After all, we do it with pigs and baboons. Or, should you be able to take things that belong to the mentally disabled, because they won't recognize the difference when those things are gone, in order to make yourself more comfortable? C) Comparison to an imaginary superior species... let's call it the Independence Day Thought Experiment. This line of thought is frequent within media... books, movies, etc.... wherein an extraterrestrial species comes to Earth in order to enslave (for labor or as food) or exterminate (to take our resources) us. Because these media are conveyed from our perspective, they are always stories of our desperate fight for survival and freedom. Using the movie Independence Day as an example, let's examine a view from the alien perspective (using pronouns as if we are the aliens): """"As a species, we are technologically, culturally, and mentally superior to the Earthlings in every way. We have mastered interplanetary travel and biotech, while they scrabble in the dirt with their first attempts to leave the planet. Our entire civilization is united and focused on the singular goal of continuity of our species, while their's is fractured, splintered, with no goals and no singular direction. The Earthlings aren't even capable of telepathy or empathic control! Our superior mental abilities mean that we have a greater right to Earth's resources than they do. Our ability to survive is thus more important than their's. Our right to exterminate them is thus morally acceptable."""" ---------------------------- No one (OK, maybe PETA) is suggesting that animals should have the same rights as humans, but we should acknowledge some *basic* rights, which I will not begin to enumerate here because I do not want to argue the semantics of it. Anthropocentrism is an excuse to deliver harm onto other living beings with a clear conscience, but while animals may not be able to perceive linear time or build spaceships, they are intelligent, feeling beings that crave love, shy away from pain, and deserve our assistance to survive. Disclaimer: I am a meat-eater who has an animal fur blanket.

How is it possible to draw a bright line between us?

I think a great test of self-awareness is the mirror test (a test to see whether an animal is able to recognize itself in a mirror versus seeing the mirror as another animal or the equivalent of a painting). Humans, dolphins, great apes, elephants, and magpies all pass the mirror test. The interesting thing is that you said once that if a group of aliens descended on Earth, """"I would fight back to find out who really is the more """"superior"""" species, but if we lose... shit happens."""" I take this to be an admission that others besides humans can become self-aware. Unless you define self-awareness as just a grab-bag of traits that only humans have, in which case yeah, there's no way I can argue with you. If you actually use an objective test, however, it's very possible some animals (such as the ones I listed above) will slip through.

If you value well-being of sentient life forms, then given our agnosticism towards animal sentience, we ought to err on the side of caution, as the price for being wrong is catastrophic. The price for being right however, is not catastrophic. As intelligent humans, we possess the ability to understand our dietary needs in such a way that animals do not, and are able to find alternative sources of protein, many of which are even beneficial to our health. So not only is it not catastrophic, but it is even beneficial. It's a win-win.

It's self-evident that we can avoid it, we shouldn't treat animals like shit. What does that mean? Most likely that animals in human captivity deserve a) proper nourishment b) proper housing and the ability to exercise c) medical attention and d) fulfillment of their social needs (ex: chickens living in groups). Why should we do this? Because if we can limit the suffering of the animals *whom we rely on* for food and other areas without unreasonably hindering our society (""""unreasonably hindering"""" does not include huge factory farms or puppy mills taking hits in their profit) than we should. Imagine if someone you know asked you to work on their dog breeding facility. On inspecting the premises you found out that the dogs spend their entire lives in small cages, never get enough food, are cooped together and their living spaces are never washed. Would you work there even if the pay was amazing? Would you buy from their business? I would hope not. So why should the principle be any different for horses, pigs, cattle, chicken and turkeys; all of which are sufficiently intelligent enough to suffer from poor living conditions and *do* suffer these kinds of conditions daily in factory farms across the world? If you were the president of said company, because of your wealth you might develop an unprecedented standard of living, but I don't know how you could be proud of it. The issue is not whether or not animals lead a """"fulfilling"""" life. Animals do not think in such terms, they merely feel happiness and suffering. I would advise you to do some research on the animals we generally farm. They take pleasure not only in food and sex, but in exercise, the outdoors and each other's company.

"I am anthropocentric, meaning that my end goal in life is the well-being of humanity, and this should not be slowed down by animal rights.

They can only fulfill the base (and I suppose some could argue the second or even third) level of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. So because of this, I say we grant animals, lets say a chicken, everything it needs to fulfill those requirements. However, chickens will never live long enough to actually change the world or become self-actualized, so what's the problem with slaughtering them earlier in life if it benefits humanity? I have a two part response to this: A. Why is 'self-awareness' (which you define oddly, but lets just go with it) so important to your system of ethics? Is it just an arbitrary decision that these self-aware entities are the ones you care most about ethically? Organisms which can not self-actualize can still sometimes feel pain. Is this not important? What about humans who never manage to reach some kind of self-actualization? Are they okay to kill? B. The animal domain is not so discrete. There are plenty of non-human animals which *do* meet your definition of self-awareness (some apes, elephants, and dolphins) and some which *may* meet your definition of self-awareness."
CMV: I don't think that being vegan for ethical reasons is reasonable,silverionmox,0,"&gt;if you just exist as a human you're definitely going to lead to some very direct animal deaths regardless of what you do, the most simple example just being the fact that animals wanting to eat those crops have to be fought off in some manner (hint: it's usually killing them by one method or the other). You have the right to live too. &gt;So what's my point? My point is that in that crazy room you're given a choice, 1 human life, your own life, or some number of animals. But turns out you've always been in that room because you are indeed constantly causing the deaths of animals, so unless you put yourself so far above the worth of the lives of those animals that you shouldn't really care about them being mass slaughtered for meat anyway, why aren't you choosing to end your own life simply out of fairness to them? or if you want to compensate fuck it just be a vegan and kill a single meat eater boom suddenly you compensated for your animal death toll. Why not kill a couple actually, drive your number way into the negatives and all. Not possible if you're also operating under a moral constraint of """"don't murder"""". Veganism is not intended as a catch-all morality. Besides, even if you killed a few people, you can still make the situation even better with low effort by eating vegan.

CMV: I don't think that being vegan for ethical reasons is reasonable,rainbows5ever,0,"So if I understand your premise is: 1. Living kills animals 2. Not eating animals reduces the number of animals but doesn't bring it to zero 3. If the number of animals that are killed by you living is greater than your personal ratio of how valuable human lives are compared to animal lives then you should be willing to kill yourself. I can think of a couple of issues with your argument. The main thing, eating meat is generally not necessary to live. It's not how much you value your own life but how much you value your own comfort. The important ratio isn't willingness to kill humans to willingness to kill animals, it's willingness to give up the positives of eating meat and animal byproducts (taste, easiness, cheapness) to willingness to kill animals or keep them captive in mass-farming conditions. If that ratio is greater than 1 you'll be a vegan and if it's less than 1 you won't. The second issue is that people don't value all animal life equally. Like maybe I think that 1 human is worth 1 cute puppy or 1,000 cows or 10,000 squirrels or an infinite number of insects. If the animals that are killed in the course of my life are squirrels and insects and relatively few higher order mammals, that might be totally within an acceptable range. A third thing is that I might value my own life at a higher rate than I value other people's, either because wanting to survive is a natural human tendency or because I'm a selfish asshole, depending on your perspective. Maybe if I had to choose between dying and two other people dying, I would choose to live. Maybe that number would go up to 10 people, if they lived on the other side of the world and I never had to meet them or their families or be a part of it in any way."

As a meat eater the only way I would choose to kill the human would be if X was such an astronomically large number that I would die of thirst or something in the process of trying to kill all the animals. But surely to a vegan there would be some much more reasonable number, it could be 1, 10, 100, 1k, 100k, 1 million? This isn't really rational.

In so doing, aren't you drawing as arbitrary a line as the judgmental vegans who bother you so much? I'm about to use slavery as an analogy, and I hope you don't think I'm implying I find your argument as reprehensible as that might make it seem, but I've found it can help me make my argument more clearly. Say that someone, themselves a slave owner, argued that while slaves ought not be mistreated for pleasure, owning and using them to one's benefit can't be argued to be immoral if the abolitionists making that judgment engage in behavior which, after a drawn out and tenuous chain of cause and effect, results in slave suffering. Does an abolitionist's use of a railroad, the construction of which was achieved in part by slave labor, mean that their argument that slavery is immoral is invalid? I think most of us would agree that it doesn't. Most of us would recognize that with an institution as insidious and pervasive as slavery was, the people of its era couldn't possibly help but engage at some point in an activity that could be said to contribute to the suffering of slaves. What percentage of an individual slave's suffering could you reasonably attribute to that one abolitionist? Thousandths of a percent? Maybe. When you sit down to a meal of a whole rotisserie chicken, what percentage of that chicken's suffering is attributable to you? It lived, likely in horrible conditions, and died, probably painfully, so that you could consume its flesh. Subtracting the use of its less palatable tissues (head, feathers, feet, organs), would you say you purchased, if not entirely consumed, about 85% of the bird?

The goal of actions that you take in most moral systems is to *reduce* suffering to the greatest extent possible. Vegetarianism reduces the amount of needless suffering in the world. It doesn't eliminate it. At some point, one has to balance being able to live with reducing the suffering of others. Vegetarianism is a reasonable compromise. &gt;Everyone going vegetarian is not the answer to our environmental problems: Factoring in that livestock would no longer need to be fed, and instead crops would only go to humans, there would be approximately 7% less co2 emissions if everyone no longer ate meat. Avoiding climate change is a major problem, which will require major reductions in CO2 emissions. The challenge is to minimize the cost of doing so. A 7% reduction is a large reduction, and can contribute a 7% increase in CO2 emissions from other sectors which may be more valuable. For instance, reducing CO2 emissions by a large amount in the first world can allow industrialization of developing countries to proceed with higher CO2 emissions limits. That likely will produce a net benefit. We should pursue every reduction strategy. &gt;Modern slaughter techniques minimize the suffering of animals: US slaughterhouses must conform to the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (HMSA) which mandates that livestock be stunned unconscious before slaughter. This also isn't really relevant. While minimizing suffering during slaughter is admirable in some sense, the least suffering comes from not killing sentient beings to begin with. &gt;Being vegetarian does not help alleviate world hunger: The root cause of world hunger is one of distribution. It isn't an issue of there not being enough available food. If there were some magic way to teleport food wherever we want at 0 cost, world hunger would be solved immediately. This assumes zero net population growth. Crop yields will ultimately have to increase to provide food to a population which may be significantly larger in the future. Combined with reduced crop and agricultural yields associated with climate change, distribution may not be the primary impediment forever. &gt;The protein replacements necessary for a vegetarian diet have a larger impact on the environment (if you live in the US) than eating locally produced meat does. Which has a solution in changing consumption and distribution practices, and not in the consumption of meat. &gt;Eating meat is not cruel, it is completely natural in the cycle of life: This is the one that I am most passionate about, for two reasons: Natural =/= right. The morality of an action is determined not by whether it occurs in nature, but whether it causes *harm* to other beings. The farming of sentient creatures most certainly causes them harm. &gt;2) I feel that the modern arguments for vegetarianism from a moral perspective incorrectly puts a higher value to animal life than plant life. Plants respond to threats, and may also be capable of fear. This is complete nonsense. Plants are not sentient. They do not experience the world, they are incapable of suffering. They are alive. Being alive, and responding to stimuli, does not mean that they """"feel"""". But even supposing it were true, the gap between a plant and a cow is enormous, far less than the difference between a human and a cow. We should prioritize minimizing suffering. Even allowing plants to suffer, we would still prefer to eat them over a cow, which feels pain, has emotions, relationships with other cows, and experiences the world in a manner not too dissimilar to the way you or I does. &gt;I don't know how well plants understand pain compared to a chicken personally, but I'm pretty sure a vegetarian does not either. It isn't complicated. Plants don't have brains, and as far as anyone can tell, a brain is required to """"feel"""". Maybe that will change, but uncertainty in the minutia of our understanding of what are ultimately epistemic issues does not justify eating things we **know** can feel. &gt;A vegetarian is okay with contributing to the death of smaller animals like mice and birds, as well as any and all insects. Both diets are just taking a """"this animal is okay to kill, this animal is not"""" approach. The difference is that one is a carefully calculated decision to minimize all suffering, and one is not. I don't see anything wrong with saying that cultivation is required for humans to live, and impacts fewer animals, causing less suffering of fewer sentient beings, and hence is preferable to the slaughter of intelligent social mammals."

Although I still wouldn't choose to kill an animal for food unless there was a better reason than just taste preference.

I think that groups are more concerned with animal rights and living conditions over fellow humans are misguided CMV,[deleted],0,"Rather simply, humans are their own advocates and advocate for each other. Someone needs to advocate for animal welfare, and make it a priority over other causes, because animals cannot advocate for themselves. My mother was an animal cruelty investigator for over a decade. The motto of the SPCA she worked for was """"We speak for those who cannot speak for themselves"""". Secondly, animal welfare problems are often not only incredibly severe, but they are also local. That is to say that people living in the west are more likely to come face to face with severe animal welfare issues than human ones. I have never personally seen a person within my region, who I could help whose condition was as severe as that of some of the animals I have rescued. It is actually within my domain of ability to save and rehabilitate, dozens of animals over my life. It is a severe problem, that is happening immediately in my surroundings that I can do something about. I have to travel abroad to find such suffering among people - it's not practical. I have a job and eventually a family to support. In the event of catastrophic events, globally, human welfare always comes first. Nonetheless, animal welfare advocates will tend to animals. This concern is considered to be one of the needs of disaster assistance. I doubt you would find many people working in such situations who would argue that funds should be diverted away from human needs. In fact, part of their role is to return valuable work animals, and even family pets to devastated families. Animals are important to people. consequently, it is of benefit to improve welfare for them to improve welfare for people. Perhaps it would be worthwhile to consider advocates for *welfare* as positive contributors, instead of setting one form of welfare advocacy against another. I don't think there's too many reasonable people who would save a dog ahead of a human, but I can think of many people who will advocate for animal welfare in their community. Since most of us live in communities relatively free of human tragedy, it is an immediate problem that we can do something about. Who, in particular, do you think believes animal welfare trumps human welfare? Does that entail that animal welfare should be *utterly ignored* until all human tragedy ends? **Edit**: Was on my phone, added content when I got to my laptop"
I think that groups are more concerned with animal rights and living conditions over fellow humans are misguided CMV,DavidRD,0,"Why does your question need to be an either/or equation? People cannot all be concerned about exactly the same thing. If that was the case then I think our social world would collapse. People care about different things and it's good that they do so. Empathetic emotions that underlay the concern about others are intuition based and some people just react very heavily on animal abuse. I am one of those people. And while I *know* that certain human conditions are as bad I just don't feel the same outrage that leads me to motivated action. The simple fact is that animals are treated on the line of non-sentient mass produced plastic toys. They are a commercial product and the reasoning that goes on when dealing with animals is the same reasoning that dominates all industries and companies, an instrumental rationality focussed only on efficiency and profitability. This is why young hens are being thrown into the meat grinder alive by the truckloads because they don't get fat as quickly as their female counterparts. They are not *useful*. Then we can question on what difference between humans and animals (or rather 'domesticated primates' and animals) we base a difference in ethics? Is it that we communicate using language and culture? Isn't ethics based on the capacity of another to experience suffering? A famous Kantian moral imperative goes: """"act so as to treat people always as ends in themselves, never as mere means"""". When people/animals are systematically treated as means only then any moral responsibility tends to systematically be rooted out go out as well because they can interfere with the ends for which they are means."

CMV: A vegan diet is not healthier or more life-extending than a balanced meat-eating diet.,Krrrobins,0,"This is a short response so i am sorry in that regard. i think you need to change only one thing about your view. And that is: a vegan['s] diet (is healthier) Its not about them being vegan because as i'm sure you've heard, you can get everything but b12 from plants (EDIT: Although this is no reason not to go meatless because you can supplement :D ). BUT a lot of what you need is VERY easy to get from meat but more, not difficult, but less commonly known in vegan food to the common person. This results in vegans tending to know more about what they are eating. And thus are more able to have a healthy balanced diet. There is no reason that meat eaters cannot have a similarly healthy balanced diet with the addition of meat. Its just more to do with the fact that because there is nothing that meat eaters cant eat THE MAJORITY don't really do the whole food watching and planning thing. and thus have less balanced and healthy diets. my argument in short is that a vegan would be able to tell you exactly what foods they need to supplement meat and get all of the stuff they need because they have to. most meaters eaters will not be able to do the same. and just by virtue of not knowing the same about their intake they probably eat a less balanced/planned/healthy diet.

CMV: A vegan diet is not healthier or more life-extending than a balanced meat-eating diet.,vl99,0,"I think your premise is true. However, consider this: In order to keep in line with a self-imposed dietary restriction, a vegan has to be much more aware of what they're putting in their body than the average meat eater. This necessitates that they read product labels carefully and research the words that they don't know the meaning of. They'll have to more regularly cook their own meals than a meat eater has to, and they'll often times have to plan meals ahead if any event is going to take place that might throw them off their usual schedule. Of course a vegan can eat fake nacho cheese, oreos, and fries that weren't cooked in animal tallow all day, but they wouldn't do so without forethought. And forethought lessens the likelihood that they'll make continuously unhealthy choices for a long period of time. Not having dietary restrictions affords people the luxury of not having to care as much about what kind of junk and how much of it is going into their bodies, but a vegan is constantly aware. So while you may indeed be able to say that a meat eater with a well balanced diet can be just as healthy as a vegan, this doesn't necessarily provide an answer to how the typical argument plays out. Usually it's an average vegan saying """"you know, you'd be healthier with a vegan diet"""" to which an average meat eater will reply """"please, I'm just as healthy as you,"""" which is not necessarily true. Just because the average meat eater can have as healthy a diet as a vegan doesn't mean they do, or even that they ever will."

CMV: A vegan diet is not healthier or more life-extending than a balanced meat-eating diet.,Xenosia,0,"Humans did not keep livestock as a food source until tens of thousands of years after our emergence, we were primarily hunter-gatherers, which means that our food sources were not guaranteed at any time. We had to vary our diets in order to survive, which means both a plant and meat-based; an omnivorous diet in order to fill the quota of nutrients our bodies and minds needed for us to continue our survival. Eating a vegan diet works nowadays only because we live in an age where there is massive agricultural farming, as well as massive variety in that farming, albeit the human population does not actually eat most of it, it is used primarily to feed livestock. You can get all your nutrients you need from a vegan diet with the exception of vitamin B12. There is no denying plants are a fundamental food directly linked to our continuing existence, and if you can plan your meals well to include all of your nutrients, good on you. Problem is, before farming, we relied on meat to substitute our plant diets, and to sustain us for longer periods when certain plants, roots, grasses and other wild edibles were not in season or doing poorly at that time. We are not supposed to eat meat for every meal, as others have mentioned, it can cause problems through digestion as it is not easy for us to break down into energy quickly. It was also very calorie ineffective to hunt, which is why it was not undertaken every day, mostly when necessary and as much as could be hunted would be hunted to prevent further hunts for a while. Meat is definitely a natural part of our diets; we succeeded this far as a race because we adapted to eating both plant and meat-based diets. So, to summarize, eat whichever way you'd like to eat, everything in moderation, neither is healthier than the other if you're actually exercising, burning the excess calories that your body does not use, and you primarily drink water as your source of liquids. It isn't difficult, we're one of the most adaptable species in the world, which is why we live on almost every continent in the world. We are meant to eat a diverse diet, but in this day and age, if you're lucky enough to live in a country of excess, you can be vegan or you can be an omnivore and that's okay."
CMV: A vegan diet is not healthier or more life-extending than a balanced meat-eating diet.,jazzdog100,0,"I think it might be an idea to look up rates of iron deficiency in vegan eaters vs. non-vegan. The most common argument for your side of the field, at least imo, is that *on average* there are greater chances of incurring imbalances in protein, exacerbating preexisting deficiencies when engaging in *any diet*. That being said, any diet can be as healthy as any other if it allows access to the required nutrients, which veganism does allow. Whether or not that is often the case in reality is another question entirely. When it comes to your individual concern, I'd argue that you should look into particular foods that you could consume (don't forget certain supplements), that would provide you with the necessary nutrients equivalent to what you normally eat. For me personally, I'm not vegan, but that's mainly because I disagree more with the ethical premises surrounding that particular belief than anything else. That and it does definitely make life a little more difficult when it comes to managing your diet. I see a lot of this attitude of 'stricter diet=more planning=healthier lifestyle'.

You are only worried about getting all the nutrients. It's an approach called [reductionism](http://nutritionfacts.org/video/reductionism-deficiency-mentality/). Even if you get all known essential nutrients, you may not get a variety of other health-promoting nutrients, and you may get things you would rather avoid. Every calorie you get from animal products (or refined carbs and fats) prevents you from eating more plant food that contains health-promoting phytochemicals. Animal products are devoid of those nutrients, they don't increase your longevity and don't reduce risks of any disease besides filling gaps in some nutritional deficiencies. Phytochemicals in plants have a variety of effects on human health, feeding a healthy gut microbiota, even contributing to positive epigenetic changes. They do actively reduce your risk of getting heart disease, cancer, diabetes and many more. What you also get from animal products is animal protein (especially methionine and lysine amino acids, resulting in higher IGF-1 levels and higher cancer rates), Neu5Gc (inflammation, cancer), animal fat (leading to inflammation and rise in LDL-cholesterol, resulting in atherosclerosis) and accumulated heavy metals, toxins and pollutants from animal fat, heme iron (toxic and cancerogenic, promotes colorectal cancer), exposure to [viruses](http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/06/07/virus-in-chicken-could-be-linked-to-obesity/) and bacteria from livestock, possibly superbugs (e.g. salmonella from chicken), things such as advanced glycation end products, heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in cooked meats. That's in theory. Basically, following a whole food plant-based diet is the only way to eat the highest amount of vegetables (and legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds, mushrooms, fruit and berries). The more, the better, and you get the most this way. Of course, the difference between eating small amounts of animal products (like a portion or two a month) and not eating them at all while following a diet based on whole foods is probably negligible. But as the amount of animal products in diet rises, the difference becomes significant."

Perhaps supporting your point however, since I have gotten to know her I have softened my rhetoric when talking about these things and try not to say negative things about people who believe them. I criticize the belief and not the believer. But even so, when among likeminded friends I still sometimes become petty and say bad things about people with those views. Ive heard her say bad things about people who believe what I do because they believe the things I do.

Being systematically slaughtered, made to stand in your own filth for the due course of your life, and then being forcibly impregnated in order to justify bottom lines is not on the same level as having a good night's rest.

I think that vegans/vegetarians avoid eating meat to reduce their just their own suffering CMV,Eh_Priori,0,"Meat production requires a lot more land than agricultural production per calorie produced. When you think about it this is obvious, not only is space needed for the animals but it still requires the use of agricultural land to feed those animals. Thus eating less meat means that less land is required for agriculture, and thus more land is left as a habitat for wildlife. Thus the number of animals alive is likely to be at least equal, if not higher in a hypothetical vegan world than in our current meat eating world. Your view also seems to presume a consequentialist ethical viewpoint, which not everyone subscribes to. Plenty of vegans think animals have an inherent right to life or that universal moral rules against needless killing or violence (including denial of freedom) apply to animals as well as humans. For example, the philosopher Tom Regan expands the position in Kantian ethics that """"every rational being must always be treated as an end in itself rather than a means to an end"""" to non-rational beings. Under this view to raise an animal as food is to use that animal as a means to an end, and thus unethical in the same way enslaving a human being might be."

Yes, you will live less time, but you will spare a large amount of suffering on your own part. Those who abstain from meat because they do not want animals to suffer believe that farm raised animals lives are so poor, that the only humane thing to do is to prevent them from being born. The equivalent of choosing to die now as opposed to being poked in the eye for another hour. So really, this comes down to a discussion on how you would rate the lives of animals before they are slaughtered for food.

For me it's liver, organ meats, brains; all of which are just as nutritious as the chicken, cow and pig meat I do consume. There is a lot of valid reasons to not find a certain food appetizing, including you are troubled by the origin of it. If you went to a disgusting, rusty, shit-covered slaughter house and were given a steak from them afterwards, I make the assumption that you would not want to eat it. Vegans feel that way, but on a larger scale. If you deny why their tastes are valid, don't you have to throw out every food preference you have? And I also strongly disagree with your last sentence. The logical conclusion would be that vegans want a world where the balance of humans and animals is found, and we don't kill animals for food because we don't have to. Your conclusion that it is """"anti-life"""" suggests that vegans base their dietary concerns out of spite and self-hatred."

If somebody really, really wanted eggs or milk though, there are probably ways. For eggs: people who get their own chickens and treat them well ( this seems very common in New Zealand) could be a source. - this would still leave some problems, if you where coming to think of the fact that about half the chicks born are male and those are usually killed, of course. If you decide that you consume of eggs, even if not bought produces more demands for chicken, you then might feel uncomfortable eating them - in which case getting eggs from rescue chickens might end up being the only alternative left. But, somebody who eats rescue chicken eggs is still not a vegan! Milk? Well, if you live in England you might be able to get milk from Ahimsa dairy, which is a no kill dairy, where the cows supposedly have pretty good life's. Of course you'd have to do research to find out if you'd be happy about the treatment of their animals first. There might be other, similar places, too. - so, a person might be able to be a non-vegan vegetarian and not really have problems ethically, or at least no problems with keeping their own morals and ethical system in balance. Health: well, that one is simple. It's really really easy to eat unhealthy on a vegan diet. Plus, as vegan ( or near vegan) you have to make sure to allways get vitamin b 12 somehow. Vegetarians don't really have to worry about that any more than meat eaters. - and junk food vegans are definitely a thing! ( ever been in a vegan specialty store?... So much delicious and expensive junk food) I don't think either vegans or vegetarians really wins out on this one, though somebody might come with sources proving otherwise. --- Now, what really irks me is that you seem to think if somebody can not be perfect they should not do anything at all. People who go vegetarian, but not vegan still reduce meat demand, often will shop more ethically sourced milk and eggs ( in my biased experience). Why should they have to decide to go the full way if they are not ready ( yet) or to give up on being vegetarian? Some change should be better than no change! --- Ok, and bees: bee keeping often is not very nice for the bees. The honey, which has health benefit not only to us but them, often is exchanged for sugar water, queen bees often will be killed and replaced by the bee keeper. Bee keepers might just kill their hives before winter... Basically, it might be an ethical problem for you how especially commercially produced honey is, well, produced. -- Ok, this post was long and rambley. Hopefully still helpful, though."

However, while vegetarianism may sometimes be healthier than a meat-eating diet, I would argue that veganism is more often a better health choice than vegetarianism alone. I'd argue vegetarianism is way healthier than veganism. Vegetarianism is also more ethical than most meat-eating. &gt; For these reasons, if you're going to be a vegetarian and justify it with an animal ethics argument or a health-based argument, you can't. You may as well either go back to eating meat, or go all the way and become vegan. That's bullshit extremism. It's about reducing footprints, 2 persons becoming vegetarian are better than one vegan and one obsesive meat-eater."

So a pig would prefer that I not stab it, rather than I stab it. He argues that if you have the proviso, then you derive rights for animals from a utilitarian perspective. What is wrong with that argument? It seems like you just take animals not having rights as some axiom. Where do rights come from?

CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are not ethically superior to standard omnivorous diet,pillbinge,0,"This is a simply stated CMV with broad implications. I'd argue that veganism and vegetarianism are ethically superior to a standard diet simply because those two diets have a far lower carbon footprint than one that incorporates meat. Any diet that increases the rate of climate change and would thus hurt *everything* regardless is worse than one that doesn't. But as far as animal lives are concerned, yes, they are separate from plants. It's not a matter of being harder to relate to. Physical pain, nociception, is an effect of a nervous system. Plants don't have the same systems as animals, plainly put. Their suffering may be different but not in any way is it observably larger than ours. Pain is not some ethereal thing you experience - it's directly related to a nervous system. Even people have various tolerances of pain. Some people suffer from an inability to feel pain, meaning if they get hurt they won't know it. Sounds amazing at first until you realize how important pain is to stopping further injury. It would certainly be sadistic and cruel, reflecting the personality of the person doing it, to """"torture"""" a jellyfish who doesn't feel pain like we know it, but that's like an alien species coming to Earth and torturing me by blowing warm air onto me and massaging my back because they hate anything warm and all physical touch.

CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are not ethically superior to standard omnivorous diet,Indon_Dasani,0,"Even if you discount the suffering of animals entirely, eating less meat (and therefore also, zero meat) might still be ethically superior to eating meat. There are economic and environmental costs associated with eating meat that are not shared by most aspects of a vegetarian diet. Meat is less efficient energy and so it is harder to produce, and the production of meat in mass quantities causes serious pollution, and the heavy use of antibodies in farming undermines the value of antibodies for *everyone* in the long term by promoting antibody-resistance. And those things might promote *human* suffering in the long term. If you believe that it is more ethical to pollute less, to do things like 'reduce your carbon footprint', then it is generally more ethical to be vegetarian. Not universally; almonds are pretty damn wasteful for instance, and you could theoretically eat a *small* amount of meat farmed responsibly to minimize your impact on the environment, and technically not be vegetarian. So some vegetarians will be more wasteful than some meat eaters. Nonetheless, on average vegetarianism will be a significant net plus."

CMV: I think that Vegans are almost always hypocritical about their morality.,Panda413,1,The word vegan isn't really necessary in this CMV. You are saying that people are hypocrites.. which is a known truth. I may choose to not shop at a store because I hear or read a story about how they treat their employees. I still buy a cell phone that has parts acquired through inhumane labor practices without giving it a 2nd thought. Deciding to not purchase a product or participate in something for moral/ethical reasons does not obligate that person to apply the same moral/ethical standards to everything they do. Many vegans are not vegan just because of moral/ethical objections to how animals are treated. Some do it just for the health benefits. So to say humans are all hypocritical at times may be correct.. but to say almost all vegans are vegan for hypocritical reasons is false.
CMV: I think that Vegans are almost always hypocritical about their morality.,embigger,0,"Purchasing goods from sweatshops is, generally speaking, the lesser of two evils. If you didn't purchase products from sweatshops, they'd go out of business, which would make a bad situation worse. And you're simply not going to force their hand into performing more ethical practices. Animals aren't voluntary actors, and the amount of suffering that they face doesn't result in any benefit to them. Of course, I'm not making the best use of the word """"voluntary"""", nor am I free of hypocrisy from myself. There are sweatshops that use slave labor. I've been vegetarian for 3 months for ethical reasons, but I understand that my consumption of dairy products funds misery as well. Getting away from dairy hasn't been working for me. That's a failure on my part."
CMV: I think that Vegans are almost always hypocritical about their morality.,DCarrier,0,"&gt; On the contrary, the vegans will gladly purchase their items that are created in morally unethical sweat shops There's a few issues here. First: alternative. If you don't eat eggs, they don't breed the chickens. It's better for chickens to never have been born than to live on factory farms, so that's helpful. If you don't buy products from sweatshops, they don't employ people to work on them. In principle that could be good, but if it was, why would they have taken that job? If I find policy changes that would improve conditions of the poor so that they're not desperate enough to take those jobs, then I'd happily follow them. Second: consent. People working in sweatshops agreed to it. Chickens didn't. This isn't so much a separate issue as a sign of the first issue. Third: scale. Working in a sweatshop sucks, but it's still better than being forced to live in a tiny area without being able to move for your entire life, which isn't really long because they kill you either for your meat or because you stopped producing eggs or milk."

At least then we can move onto the more urgent point of the environmental damage that industrial agriculture is causing."
CMV: I think that Vegans are almost always hypocritical about their morality.,happyprocrastination,0,"For me, veganism represents minimizing how much harm you do to the world and to the animals within the boundaries of your realistic means (!). For example, I would not call a vegan hypocritical who needs medication produced using animal products. Many vegans are in fact aware of the problems caused by the electronics/fashion industry and I would say they care more than the average person, because veganism often automatically extends to being aware of all wrongdoings in modern society. However, boycotting the fashion industry you must either make everything yourself or buy fair fashion at all times (many do this, or are minimalists, or buy clothes second hand). Boycotting the electronics industry is even harder, almost impossible, if you do not want to live like a hermit in modern times. You cannot really resort to used products because everything is so short-lived. I guess here you could also argue that being able to use social media through electronics enables you to have a net positive net if you are an activist, but I'll give you this is rather far fetched and most people do not do that. Point is, it is relatively easy and very affordable to be vegan. Doing something positive in this one department is better than doing nothing at all just because your actions seem more consistent if you live a life that is not conscious at all. So many vegans either do indeed care and therefore consume more consciously/fairer products whenever possible. Others are just vegan for health reasons, which does not make them hypocritical. And those who have the means to pay attention to all these things and still choose to support everything but the animal industry.. well I guess you can call them hypocritical, but they still do more than the average person, so we cannot really judge them for that. Oh, and another point I would like to raise, but that might be uneducated and/or wrong: the countries that produce the goods unethically mostly find themselves in a sort of industrial revolution. It is hard for us to help this fact. We can stop breeding more animals to kill and torture but we can hardly stop those people from having children they need to feed. Often, it is not the large brands that directly order unethical treatments of workers. It is the third-world-companies that treat their workers like disposable goods and the large brands that have contracts with them and often pretend they did not know about the conditions (which is still shitty). Now I am not sure what would happen to all those workers if all brands would switch to fair contractors or stop producing in the third world altogether. I can imagine many would lose their jobs and end up even poorer than before. Since those workers are able to do a decent job, I do not see it as an end solution to just stop producing there (as opposed to “we need to stop killing animals, full stop“). But as the average consumer, it is hard to make the brands kick their contractors' butts to treat their workers fairly. I am unsure if stopping to buy their products would deliver the message as easily. For food production the chain is mostly consumer -&gt; brand -&gt; farm (farm being in the same country or neighbor country). For clothes/electronics it is consumer -&gt; brand -&gt; contractor -&gt; factory with a shift in countries in between. I am still leaning towards pressuring the brands to put pressure on the contractors to change up their factory conditions by limiting consumption of unethical products, but this is another thing that is imo worth thinking about, so I just wanted to mention and would maybe like feedback on this."

There are two types of goods, elastic and inelastic. An elastic good is easily replaced with an alternative. Inelastic means difficult or even impossible to replace. For example, water is inelastic, because everyone needs water. Coca Cola, on the other hand, is very elastic because you could easily replace it with any other soft drink. Types of foods are elastic, since meat is not necessary to survive. There is little to no inconvenience to a vegan diet if you live in the western world. On the other hand, the products you mentioned are somewhat inelastic. You can't really replace a cell phone, and going without one is very difficult. Clothing is the same thing.

CMV: I think that Vegans are almost always hypocritical about their morality.,TheChemist158,0,"&gt;The argument that it is immoral and antithetical to purchase (and support) these industries products' falls apart under scrutiny that the same vegan will purchase items that are created in sweat shops where people half-a-world away are struggling to afford to eat, or are being forced to work for pennies on the dollar for upwards of fourteen hours a day. So what, if a person is hypocritical it means their argument is invalid? If you think that vegans are right, harming animals is bad, but these other things are bad too, wouldn't you naturally conclude that you shouldn't do either? Pointing out hypocrisy doesn't negate the point, it only attacks the speaker's reputation. Secondly, we live in a world that causes harm. Being vegan isn't about not causing any harm to animals because that would be impossible. It is about minimizing harm. We don't live in a world that permits us to never harm anyone else. Rather than give up and cause whatever harm we want whenever we want, let's just do what we can. Vote with our dollars. Be aware of what your money is going to fund, and try to fund things that you like and avoid funding things that you dislike. I think that most vegans at least try to mindful about other aspects. I keep my electronics as long as I can. I buy used when I can. I don't eat meat. It's not about being perfect, it's about trying."

The reason I say this is that the focus of ethics should be to correct ourselves when we do something wrong, or to otherwise make some improvements to the world around us. Framing things in terms of who is a hypocrite or who is a bad person for their lifestyle choices is not productive because it makes things more about defending one's existing choices and by extension one's standing as a """"good person"""" rather than getting good outcomes. It's easier to be flexible enough to change when you basically don't care about what your actions say about your character.

CMV: I think that Vegans are almost always hypocritical about their morality.,cyberpunking,0,"Assuming that a person is aware of all the injustices and unethical practices that go into producing products they consume, it is still very difficult to consume in a way that does not have any unethical impact (depending on your ethical views, i suppose). often for financial reasons, lack of awareness of alternatives, or social forces, it can be hard for a person to stop consuming a particular unethical product. For many people, a diet change is one of the most easy, affordable, ways in which they can start having more ethical practices. What you are saying is that people should not take any actions towards consuming more ethically, until they can take every possible ethical action simultaneously to have a perfect ethical impact.

That's why many people think the moral thing to do when you see a human or animal suffering a long painful death is to """"put it out of its misery."""" Vegetarians and vegans would conclude that it be better for those species to no longer be, than have billions of them suffer horribly painful lives and murders. **Question for you:** if you knew that when you had a child, they would be confined, sexually assaulted, and finally brutally murdered after being beaten and tortured their entire lives, would you still have the child, or spare them by not getting pregnant in the first place? # 2.

The meat that we currently produce in industrial farming is not nearly as healthy as meat you might get from hunting a wild animal though. As for protein, what's important is that you get all of your [Essential Amino Acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_amino_acid) and you get an adequate amount. Meat and other animal products, generally, are [Complete Proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_protein), which means they contain all of the Essential Amino Acids. There are non-animal product complete proteins ([soybeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean#Nutrition)), and you can also combine multiple incomplete proteins as well. Getting an adequate amount of protein isn't difficult. Beans, nuts, and seeds all contain high amounts of protein. B12 might be a better argument. We require B12, and """"naturally"""" speaking, animal products have been our only viable source of B12 for the longest time. Now, however, we can produce it in large quantities from bacteria (the same bacteria that animals eat in order to be sources themselves) and we fortify foods with it. Vegetarian, vegan, and omnivorous diets are all viable and can all be healthy. You don't have to eat meat to survive anymore. **Question for you:** do you think the average person who eats meat gets adequate amounts of the vitamins and nutrients they need? #4. Delicious Food I enjoy the taste, texture, and aroma of meat. However, I do not think the **happiness** (read *Good*) I enjoy from consuming meat outweighs the **suffering** (read *Bad*) of forcing an animal through a life of misery and eventual slaughter. After becoming a vegan, I realized there were so many amazing tasting foods that I had never tried because I had never stepped outside of a routine diet that always placed meat at the forefront. If I have cravings for meat or other animal products, I have found alternatives that taste just as great to me. Are they perfect? No, but it tastes close enough for something that doesn't require an animal to be killed.

"I think most vegetarians and vegans are ignorant, and every single concept they have is absolutely stupid. CMV.",molecularmachine,0,"&gt;First of all if we stopped to consume meat that would be disastrous for multiple animal species. Not true. I know that a lot of people think farm animals are incapable of living in the wild, so let us address that first. They can do just fine. Feral pigs, chickens, cattle, horses, turkeys exist throughout the world. In many places they are doing so well they have exploded in population numbers, in other places they are holding steady. Wolves are dying out because humans hunted them since we felt the need to kill more wolves so we can kill more prey animals. In places where wolf populations are finally rising hunters are petitioning to kill them off again. Even if we do not breed these animals and exploit them for food and clothing there are already feral population of these species established, so it is highly unlikely these species will die out. Look at India, even in places where no one kills them, no one eats them or exploit them cows thrive. &gt;If we stop the meat industry that would be a huge hit on the economy. The subsidies that go into the meat industry could go into other areas to create jobs. In reality working in the meat industry is not profitable, without hefty help from the government via taxpayers dollars the industry would go belly up in no time at all. A lot of slaughterhouse employees present with PTSD symptoms, a large portion of them are abusing alcohol and drugs to get through the day. Their job is the job with the highest turnover in the world. There are other jobs that could be created with all that money being pumped into the meat industry. Jobs that do not give you PTSD or that you don't feel the need to drink away your memories of. &gt;Meat is healthy. Sure, eating too much eat isn't but we still need meat-it provides natural proteins and other necessary substances. And a lot of them. You would say bananas also have proteins, but not as much. You need less meat to get more proteins. We do not need meat. Especially not for proteins. 100 g black beans contain 22g protein and 0.2g saturated fats. 100g of beef mince contains 14g protein and 11g saturated fat. I know which one sounds more protein packed and healthy to me. Those black beans even have more iron than the beef mince does. (why am I comparing beef mince and black beans? Because they are more akin in price.) &gt;Meat is delicious. Having all my previous argument I find it stupid to strip ourselves from such a pleasure in life. There are plenty of other flavours out there much more pleasurable than meat. And I cannot say I agree, there is nothing delicious about meat. What may be delicious is something fatty, salty and smoky. Which are flavours you can get without the meat."
"I think most vegetarians and vegans are ignorant, and every single concept they have is absolutely stupid. CMV.",fatspoon,0,"1. A lot of vegetarians don't think we should stop consuming meat all together, but have an issue with the factorisation of meat production. Therefore they don't eat meat because someone has to start, but I think to kill your own animal in the wild and eat it would not seem abhorrent to 100% of vegetarians. Take a look at the trailer for the film 'earthlings' on its website for more clarification on this point. Getting ourselves into a situation where we have lots of animals and nothing to do with them but kill them is not a reason to carry on killing them - multiple generations of them. Cows released into the wild in the uk would not die out, there are no cow predators and miles of grass. Then they could be fair game, hypothetically. 2. GDP is a retarded way to measure the success of a country because it doesn't take minor points like happiness and well being into account. This is definitely relatable to slavery - they weren't seen as equals to us, and therefore it was moral to put them through suffering. Animals do suffer, they just don't have the same level of self reflection. The point with the meat industry is that costs take a higher importance than wellbeing, so animals suffer a lot in the process - and if you don't care about that, then know that when we eat that meat we take on all the stress chemicals released into their system when they die. 3. Meat is healthy but so are vegetables. Such an arbitrary point. Talking about your friend is similar to taking any drug case from the one percent of people who don't use drugs sensibly and citing it as a case for all. 4. Meat is delicious. But ever heard of too much of a good thing?"

"I think most vegetarians and vegans are ignorant, and every single concept they have is absolutely stupid. CMV.",Logan_Chicago,0,"I've worked at a pig slaughter house and I'd consider myself semi-vegetarian so maybe I can provide some insight. 1. The issue with this argument is that you assume that captivity equates to success. Are the humans being harvested in *The Matrix* successful as a species? Would them living like that be better than extinction? I'm not entirely sure. I think anyone who's honest with themselves would recognize that as a complex position with valid points on both sides. Wolves died out because they are on the same wrung of the food chain as us. They are our direct competitors. Apex predators throughout the animal kingdom are doing rather poorly because of us. 2. I would argue that the industry could change from one of quantity to one of quality like many American industries have had to. When I eat meat it's at special occasions and I try to only eat good quality meat. If you're going to eat it, do it with purpose. Also, less meat means more other food in other areas so it doesn't necessarily mean less jobs. 3. Meat is not necessarily healthy. It's thought that meat helped humans evolve as it's much more calorically dense and thus allowed us to have smaller digestive tracts while maintaining the expensive tissue that is our brain. Anyways, there are many studies that show that the more meat and animal products in general you consume the more likely you are to die of cancer and cardiovascular disease (the two leading causes of death in the US). &gt; And a lot of them. Lack of nutrition is not a big threat in the US. &gt; You would say bananas also have proteins, but not as much. You need less meat to get more proteins. For people who say we can acquire the proteins via some chemically made proteins I disagree. I had a friend who turned allergic to those. He went to numerous cities, hospitals etc. Not worth the risk. You're talking about amino acids. There are 9 essential and 20 overall. Meat does in fact provide all of them as do certain other foods like quinoa, soy, eggs, etc. But of course it comes with other things too like cholesterol and saturated fat. By eating variety this is easily overcome, and to add to this I'm not sure what people's obsession with protein is. It should only make up about 20% (give or take) of your diet. If you're working out a lot your body can only add 10-15 pounds of lean body mass every year so lets take the extreme end: (15 lbs x 454g/lb)/365 day in a year = 18.7 grams of protein extra per day. That's roughly 4 tablespoons of peanut butter or 3 eggs worth of protein. It's just not that much. 4. Meat can be delicious, but it can also be passe and boring. You don't have to entirely cut meat out of your diet but perhaps think about when you're just mindlessly eating it. Asian cultures typically eat far less meat but elevate it to much higher qualities. Think of sushi. The quantity is far less but the preparation, cut of meat, and presentation are all obsessed over. I can't comment on other animals but pigs know what the deal is when they're unloaded off the trucks. They're as smart as dogs. They look you in the eye as if to say """"hey man come on"""" then they piss themselves and go up the conveyor. It's a bit sad."
"I think most vegetarians and vegans are ignorant, and every single concept they have is absolutely stupid. CMV.",opencomp48573,0,"One of, if not the, most common misconception about vegetarians is that they want to push their beliefs on others. Most people with special diets of all kinds are very happy to go about their lives without discussing or pushing their thoughts on others. Like religious zealots, those that make the most noise in the public spheres are a loud, vocal minority. With that being said, there are two main beliefs that most vegetarians have that I see you failed to mention. I would like to know if you think these are """"absolutely stupid."""" 1. Several animals that we currently eat are being farmed in such a way that we are driving them extinct. Yes, we will always have chicken and cows, but we have pushed several other species to dangerously low levels. If we decide to eat and farm an animal, then we have a responsibility to do it in a sustainable way to ensure that we do not kill off the entire species. 2. Many animals from sustainable farming are raised in a way that is done for maximum efficiency and minimal cost. As a result, we have had outbreaks of disease in our food supply that has caused several deaths. If we are going to farm animals, we should do it in a way that ensures a high health standard for the eventual consume of the meat. This will have the added side effect of providing farm animals with a higher quality of life. Do you believe that both or either of these ideas are """"ignorant"""" or """"absolutely stupid""""?"

"I think most vegetarians and vegans are ignorant, and every single concept they have is absolutely stupid. CMV.",andjok,0,"1. It's not like everybody is going to become vegetarian/vegan all at once. It's happening gradually, and as such the meat producers will simply breed fewer animals, and they will keep breeding fewer and fewer of them as less people demand their products. I would have no problem with these animals becoming scarce, it is animal suffering which I care about. And not every vegetarian or vegan supports PETA (many don't), so we don't all want the farm animals to be released into the wild. I would be in favor of people keeping former farm animals as pets and breeding them as little as possible. It makes zero sense to raise animals for food simply because you want there to be a lot of them, animals can't suffer if they never exist in the first place. 2. This is ignorant of economics. With this line of reasoning, we shouldn't have ever invented any labour saving device, because humans will have their jobs replaced by machines. But what actually happens is that resources are made more efficiently and/or in more abundance and the market adjusts. In the case of meat production specifically, it uses a [ludicrous amount of land and resources to raise animals for food. And the government subsidizes the production of meat,](http://darwin.bio.uci.edu/sustain/global/sensem/MeatIndustry.html) thus hiding the true cost of meat, which would be around $35 for a hamburger and $89 for a pound of beefsteak without the subsidies. If people stopped eating meat, the money spent on those subsidies could be spent on something else, thus creating jobs in other areas and using resources more efficiently. 3. You are right that plant foods typically contain less protein than meats and such. However, [you don't need as much protein as you think you do, and too much protein can be bad for your health](http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/protein.php). Some great vegan sources of protein are nuts, rice, beans, soy, and other legumes. As long as you eat a varied and balanced vegan diet, you'll probably get the protein you need. 4. I know what meat tastes like, I used to eat it too. However, I find it selfish to only care about pleasure while causing so much pain and suffering to animals, destroying the environment, and wasting resources. Our current method and level of meat production is unsustainable, and either in-vitro meat will catch on as the dominant method of meat production or many people will have to go without in the future."

Huge number of land animals doesn't disprove them - actually it means that cruelty and suffering are large scale.

In my moral system pleasure from eating chicken doesn't outweigh death and terrible suffering of chicken at factory farm for months. Owning slaves is very useful and convenient for slave owner too, and many famous people through history find slavery acceptable - but it doesn't mean slavery is OK and not cruel.

"I think most vegetarians and vegans are ignorant, and every single concept they have is absolutely stupid. CMV.",naturalveg,0,"&gt; It's like everyone is simply ignoring this one. First, most vegans have done a TON of research and have considered every single issue you could bring up, including this one. 1. If you thought really carefully about it you would realize that this isn't realistic. As consumer demand for meat declines, the industry will breed fewer and fewer until they are breeding none, or just a few. There is no realistic scenario where animals will be released into the wild. If we want to keep the species from dying out completely, we can take care of them peacefully in places like [Farm Sanctuary](http://www.farmsanctuary.org/) 2. The economy has survived huge shifts in industry. We survived the shift from landlines to wireless, from horse and buggy to motor vehicles, from VHS to DVD, from cash to credit. We can survive the shift from meat to plants. No problem. 3. Meat is not healthy. There are studies showing that vegans and vegetarians have lower risk of many diseases than meat-eaters. We need far less protein than people think, and plants provide far more than enough. We do not need meat. 4. Plant-based food is delicious too. I get great pleasure from my food. I have not stripped myself of anything except unnecessary cruelty. &gt; Am I stuck in time or am I right? Not only are you """"stuck in time"""", but its quite obvious that you haven't done any research on this topic.

"I think most vegetarians and vegans are ignorant, and every single concept they have is absolutely stupid. CMV.",I-HATE-REDDITORS,0,"&gt; It's like everyone is simply ignoring this one. If we stop the meat industry that would be a huge hit on the economy. Thousands of people would lose their jobs, thousands of families won't have income, thousand of factories will fail. While the economy will survive it'll be a huge hit on the GDP of every country. Everyone else has done a pretty good job of responding but I have something to add on this point. Meat consumption was fairly low throughout all of US history until it began to explode in the 1950s. During that time, the U.S. became a superpower and built the largest economy and middle class in the world. In recent decades, we've seen rising income inequality even though meat consumption has been at an all-time high. Our economy's success or failure has little to do with the meat industry. Also, the meat industry probably doesn't help the economy as much as you might expect. First, it's heavily subsidized. Is it good for the economy when the government buys [$170 million of meat to bail out factory farms](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-08-13/obama-to-urge-agriculture-bill-as-usda-buys-170-million-of-meat)? The current state of the meat industry is dominated by factory farms (by 99%) which are NOT good for workers or the economy. First, consider their environmental toll as a financial burden on everyone. Then, consider that factory farms have some of the highest worker turnaround rates, occupational injury rates, and lowest wages. Many factory farms largely employ undocumented immigrants-- is that helping the economy? Again, 99% of meat in the United States is sourced from a factory farm operation. The livestock-raising family farms that once made up part of a healthy American middle class are all but extinct."

Meanwhile, the western practices of factory farming are responsible for immense environmental devastation. Something like 70% of all grains grown in the U.S. are fed to livestock to produce meat, and meat production accounts for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions (compared to 13% from cars/trucks/etc).

It doesn't have to be a stiff and bedeviling ideology, but it can make a difference to put it on your ethical radar, to be just a bit more thoughtful and anxious of the impact you have in everything you consume, and how much you consume.

So one argument in favour of vegetarianism is that meat-eating exacerbates issues of social and economic inequality especially in 3rd world countries. Meanwhile, there are a host of environmental issues surrounding land use and meat-production, and environmental sustainability *is* a human morality issue because destroying our ecosystems is going to have a very negative impact upon humanity as a whole.

Let's say for instance that the Nazis didn't target Western Europe, but instead remained focused on the Soviets, never allying with them and ultimately defeating them. Japan's empire may or may not have been eventually defeated. We can reasonably assume in this case, what we know of as 'scientific racism' would simply have simply remained science. Sure, some of it would of been eventually debunked, but it would of been more of a paradigm progression, rather than a 180 shift. The backlash against the unscientific, axiomatic idea at its core: that the national or ethnic is where 'your people' begins would never have occured. In this world, a universal morality based on the human species wouldn't be as popular idea. What then? This is of course a thought experiment. You don't have to engage with its specifics. It's just to point out that the genetic relatedness is a continuum. We could also point this out with alternate worlds where neanderthals never became extinct, for instance. Species are not an objective quality of the physical world, but species is an abstraction we use to understand it. I can't think of reason to restrict morality to it. Further, if people's emotional states about say, pets, their property in the form of animals or even wild animals is a utility, then we don't need to in order to justify vegetarianism.

Certainly someone who aims to eliminate any animal suffering at all should not let this chance to reduce it lie. He also should tackle those other issues, but that he can do by other means.

In that way, you're both contributing yourself and encouraging future switchers. I think it's like gluten free in a way.

Also, you for some reason assume that animal-rights-vegetarians don't also boycott these other sources of cruelty, which is in my experience not the case at all. Your """"admittedly outlandish"""" point about not causing suffering to plants is just plain stupid. It's a straw man of the vegetarian standpoint. Everyone knows killing is essential for survival, otherwise we wouldn't be allowed to take antibiotics. This also applies to your claim that """"we must focus on ALL animals."""" There are some radical vegetarians who might agree that all animals are equal, but the majority recognize some sort of hierarchy. Mammals (the majority of eaten animals) clearly have brain functions similar to humans, whereas mosquitoes are mindless. And while we're on the subject, it's worth noting that a lot of pesticides (despite the name) don't actually kill animals - they are simply deterrents. I also think you're ignoring the rise of free-range and cruelty-free farming over the last couple decades. Yes the majority of the meat industry is disgustingly cruel, but clearly the animal rights movement has had some effect. Oh and one final point about dogs which probably doesn't affect your view: the choice is not only between puppy mills or specialized breeders. Dog shelters are overcrowded, and adoption is by far the most humane option available to them. As for dog food, my understanding is it's mostly made from discarded by-products of human meat production, so it's not like dog food is responsible for an the number of animals killed because otherwise the waste-meat would just be thrown away."

You are using """"animals"""" as an all-encompassing term, but making like 6 different points here. Most vegetarians ARE against the fur trade, and puppy mills, and all of the other ways that animals are mistreated. It's not like they're going out and buying fur coats and saying that we shouldn't eat these animals. Also, I think you'll find that a great number of vegetarians are likewise in favor of pesticide-free foods, which negates that point as well. If the only reason that so many cows are being killed is to feed us (and it is), then it logically follows that if we don't need them for feeding us, that they won't be killed.

Furthermore, I don't know of too many vegetarians that buy dogs from puppy mills and wear fur... in fact, I can't say I know of any. Secondly, you talk about the """"mass production"""" of animals. Mass production is an economic instrument to produce large amounts of a good for cheap. It is an attempt to minimize costs and maximize profit due to high demand. As demand shrinks, less meat eaters in your example, a market adjusts supply or else they are tossing away money in unused perishable goods. I think it's strange that you bring up mass production, but ignore the basic supply and demand tenants that our Western market capitalism is based on."
CMV: Vegetarianism accomplishes nothing towards the better treatment of animals.,bermuda--blue,0,"In short: Vegetarianism and animal rights activism is about *minimizing suffering.* Animals, like humans, and individuals who experience pain and fear, and in this since every single animal saved is a victory. Most vegetarians who are vegetarians for animal rights reasons (I have been one for 11 years) are aware of and respond to other animal rights issues as well. Many of us shop cruelty free brands, adopt shelter pets and boycott puppy mills, and avoid leather, gelatin, circuses, etc. The plant argument is an old and trite one, and I usually roll my eyes at it, but you seem earnest so I will bite. There is currently no convincing scientific evidence that plants experience pain, fear, or any other emotion. So if one is avoiding animal suffering, it is because that suffering exists and is real. If we find out that plants can suffer in some meaningful way, I will gladly work to minimize that suffering as much as can. At this point that does not seem to be the case. Indeed, vegetarianism *has* had a significant impact on the meat industry in the world. One vegetarian may not have a huge impact, but there are now upwards of 7 million vegetarians in the US. There are also a large number of people who eat vegetarian more often. This is a huge decrease in the demand for meat and prevents many millions more animals from being bred, tortured, and then slaughtered. I think the word """"animal"""" is problematic because it assumes there is some monolithic thing that is """"animal"""" that includes all living non-plants except humans. This is silly yet it is deeply imbedded in our cultural understanding of what it means to be human. In truth, a chimp or an elephant has much more in common with me than it does with an alligator, a bee, or a jellyfish. So your argument that we must either go all or nothing makes no sense when you think of animals as the rich and complex group of organisms that we really are. Saying """"we cannot do any good unless we can do ALL the good"""" would be like saying """"we can't adopt a child because we would then have to adopt them ALL."""" Your overall opposition to vegetarianism is pinned down to """"that's just how things are,"""" which is never a good argument when it comes to ethics. You're avoiding entering an ethical debate by simply stating how things currently are and assuming that it will always be so. Such arguments pay no attention to history, and just how much really can change (and quite quickly, too). Part of me thinks so many people default to this kind of position because it allows them to opt out of the discussion all together when they actually do have a sneaking suspicious that they are participating in a great wrong."

Land use for farming destroys habitats, and eliminating meat intake eliminates huge swaths of farmlandland that could then be used for animal habitats. Greenhouse gas emissions (fertilizer, feed, fuel, pesticides, etc) are higher per kilogram and per calorie for most meats than they are for vegetarian staples (lentils, rice, peanut butter, etc.).

CMV: Vegetarianism accomplishes nothing towards the better treatment of animals.,phobophilophobia,0,"&gt;If you decide to not eat animals so that (hopefully) less farm animals are subject to such horrible conditions, you are ignoring the bigger picture. Animals are mass produced for a variety of reasons, not only for human consumption. Animals are used for fur, held in captivity for entertainment, animal feed (like feeder mice and fish), and are mass produced as pets. If you choose to not eat meat, you must also agree that you should not own a pet from a pet store because this means the animal was bred in a mill of mass production. This does allow you to purchase a dog from a reasonably adequate breeder, however don't think that you can feed them 90% of dog foods that are in the store. The meat in the kibble comes from the same places our meat comes from. Admittedly, I'll mention that there are vegetarian dog foods, however, I would not be willing to say that it's a particularly healthy diet for an omnivorous dog. So you do run into a bit of a dilemma when deciding what you want to feed your dog. People who don't eat meat for ethical reasons are more often than not also against exploiting animals for other uses too, so I don't see your point. If you take this stance, then it is of course advisable to only have pets that can thrive on vegetarian diets. I already had a dog when I went vegan, so I choose to bite the bullet and pay for meat products for now. To provide my dog with proper nutrition from plants would be incredibly expensive. So, my next pet will likely be a pig. They make great pets and thrive on horse feed and veggies. &gt;If you choose to avoid things that are derived from the cruel treatment of living things, then you could also make a similar argument pertaining to plants. Plants aren't sentient, they don't feel pain or pleasure nor do have emotions. That's why people refrain from eating animals and choose a plant based diet. You can't really be cruel to something that doesn't experience life. &gt;The way we treat ALL animals are simply ignored by vegetarians. This is because animals generally have no rights. We have pesticides that protect our crops. We have exterminators that remove vermin from our houses. Animals are hunted, sometimes for better reasons than others. And then there's also animal testing (which I feel is for the greater good), yet does unavoidably lead to the suffering of animals. The thing we are ultimately trying to avoid. Vegetarianism is not completely useless, only mostly. Again, many of us avoid using products that are tested on animals (most products that are tested on animals only serve our most trivial interests and have tried and true, cruelty-free alternatives; admittedly, the good may outweigh the bad when it comes to some medical testing, but cosmetic testing is entirely unnecessary). I don't hunt, and I'd rather eat food that isn't doused in pesticides. But, yes, animals are going to die as a result of agriculture. The point is to minimize your impact, not eliminate it. &gt;To speak realistically about the world: a small percentage of newfound vegetarians does not impact the specific industry nor the whole picture all together. Even a quite large number would not change the world. Animals will be used for food even if no humans eat it. Animals will be mistreated, big and small. They are utilized by humans in such ways that achieves us the most comfortable life possible. To become a vegetarian does little that will change the overall treatment animals. Yet, even if I take this as truth (though I don't), I have no interest in taking part in something I disagree with."

CMV.",thisplayisabouteels,0,"Yeah, it's difficult to change a view on taste, I suppose the real question is what you're asking. Are you looking for a change of view on how bland vegetarian food is? (If so, I'd recommend trying specific cuisines - indian and italian spring to mind, various asian cuisines like Thai or vegetarian chinese) Or are you looking for an argument about whether or not taste should be *more* important than ethical concerns? Because that's a whole different kettle of fish. EDIT: To expand on my first point (I'll only expand on the second if that's what you're looking for), it's my experience as a vegetarian that I actually eat far more widely and generally discover far more interesting flavours and types of food; mostly because I'm actually forced to expand my horizons to avoid eating lentils and tofu all the time. For example, a regular week of dinners looks something like this: Monday - gnocchi (an italian pasta made from potatoes), generally with different sauces; napolitana, creamy mushroom and spring onion, etc. Tuesday - generally pizza, because we have cheap Tuesdays in our neighbourhood; we'll generally get a Margharita and a gourmet vegetable Wednesday - Moroccan soup with pita bread or *pane de casa* (the soup's made out of tomato, chick peas and other various stuff) Thursday - some kind of kiesh and omelette with salad Friday - Indian, often take away or made at home (Indian's a great food for vegetarians and vegans, since so much of their cuisine is meat free already) This'll generally be preceded by a mixture of antipasto and lebanese/greek finger foods, and followed by cheese and fruit. Whereas when eating meat, I found my meals were exactly what you classify vegetarian options as - fairly bland and boring, 3 vegetables and steak every night.

I changed my diet not for moral reasons, but for health reasons. Heart disease runs rampant in my family, and after seeing the issues my parents started having in their early 50's I took action. I tried a few things, and aided giving up near at all costs, I finally convinced myself to try one month of eating completely vegan, and also cut out all processed foods. The first two weeks were hell, I dreaded eating, everything tasted the same, and that taste was bad. Somewhere in the third week I got better at cooking vegan, and by the time I hit the one month point I was actually pretty happy with the food I was eating. Then I went out and had some meat, as a sort of celebration for my holding out, and you know what. It tasted pretty good, but not anywhere near as good as I remembered. I couldn't get over just how greasy and overpowering it was. I still ate the whole burger, but did not get the satisfaction I expected, and even stranger, even I was done the only thing I could think of was just eating a salad, I felt like my blood was sludge and I just wanted some crisp clean veggies. My parents switched their diet after my experiment and within 6 months were both down 35lbs and off most their heart medications. It has been 2 years now and they are off all medication, and both down to the original weight from their marriage (-50lbs for dad, 40 for mom), and that is with changing nothing in their life other than diet. That sold it for me. I will admit I still have meat from time to time, usually thanksgiving or somewhere where there aren't many vegan options because I don't like being that douche that makes a big deal out of it, my point meeting though that if you eat food rich in fat, salt, or sugar, it is easy to over saturate your taste buds and make other things taste bland. Tl:dr tastes change. Things taste bland if your body is used to very rich foods. Try giving up soda for a couple weeks and then try one again and see if it doesn't taste noticeably different.

Far more often it is the carnist making an appeal to nature. See: """"We're omnivores!"""", """"Our canines!"""", """"We evolved with meat!"""" &gt;A diet that does not contain animal products pretty much necessitates supplements. A diet requiring one vitamin (B12) is not unhealthy just because you should take the vitamin while on it. After all, taking the vitamin [prevents any deficiency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1884303/). The belief that vitamins are bad and makes a diet bad is pseudoscience, and in my opinion, very similar to an appeal to nature. There are many other actually valid criteria on which to evaluate a diet. &gt;There will be fewer animals killed, yes, but that is because there will be fewer of those animals. Whatever populations are left once breeding is discontinued will be hunted by their natural predators (and in a less humane way than we kill them). Are you saying that bringing animals into existence to be abused and killed is better than not being created at all? Is it also immoral to not be endlessly conceiving human children? Think of all the lives that will never be because people decided not to have kids, or not to have the maximum number of kids they are physically capable of. &gt;This view is indefensible. Bees produce honey anyway, chickens lay eggs anyway, cows produce milk anyway, all animals die anyway. The only difference is that on a farm, these resources are harvested for the good of another species. You just said that less animals are bred and killed.

You have no reason to believe this. &gt;A lion does not treat an antelope with anywhere near the same courtesy a human hunter/farmer would. Non-human animals do many things we find unethical; they steal, rape, eat their children and engage in other activities that do not and should not provide a logical foundation for our behavior. This means it is illogical to claim that we should eat the same diet certain non-human animals do. So it is probably not useful to consider the behavior of stoats, alligators and other predators when making decisions about our own behavior. &gt;Farm animals are cared for. They are mistreated and killed. &gt;Pets provide utility in being a companion, farm animals provide utility in the creation of resources. To kill the dog would cease its utility. Therefore, I would not kill any pet, regardless of specie.

If there are less environmentally damaging ways to produce food then it would be ethical to go that route. Environmental damage is damage to human health and material wellbeing.

The logical end goal then would be to not eat any meat at all or to eat as little as possible to not suffer b12 deficiencies.

Presumably we wouldn't be reintroducing domesticated livestock into the wild, it'd make no sense and many would die of other factors. Plus the transportation logistics would be kind of absurd. We'd just finish them off but stop breeding after that presumably. &gt; If an animal deemed their treatment worse than living in their natural habitat, they would show signs of distress. Well, some animals don't have natural habitats, and still others may not necessarily recognize their captivity or be distressed by it yet it may still be a worse life for them. Hell, there are people that don't even recognize their poor lifestyles as the source of their suffering. &gt; the only standard to compare our treatment of animals to is other predatory animals. No, we can have our own standard. There's no reason for other predatory animals to dictate how we do or think about anything. We're distinct enough as beings capable of thinking and problem solving and ethics and so on that other animals don't compare to. Non-human predators presumably don't consider the morality of meat eating, that makes us distinct enough on its own, so it's not somehow more reasonable for us to use them as a standard. &gt; Does a bee care that its excess honey is """"stolen"""" from it? Does it matter whether animals care in the way that humans do? Why isn't that they suffer for our actions regardless of how aware of and/or concerned about what we do to them a bigger or at least valid moral issue? &gt; To kill the dog would cease its utility. Admittedly I feel creepy saying this, but meat is a utility and there are circumstances in which a dog meat may serve someone better than their other purposes. Some dogs were companion first, food second historically as well. I still wouldn't kill and eat my dog but it's for emotional, sentimental reasons, not some judgement about utility. That a person could eat a dog doesn't say anything about the morality of meat eating though. _________ I'm not a vegetarian or vegan myself, I just think some of your arguments have problems. Here are some considerations I think are interesting: * Absence of natural predators due to human activities puts a responsibility on humans to hunt some animals to prevent overpopulation which leads to car accidents(deer) among other issues like environmental damage and the overeating of their natural food source potentially leading to migration into problematic areas or just starvation. * Meat may soon enough be producible without animals being killed at all (in-vitro) and is more likely to lead to a cessation of disturbing animal farming practices than vegan/vegetarian activism is - albeit you don't necessarily have to be vegan or vegetarian to not support such practices in the meantime either. There's also insect meat, and insects may be different in important ways morally from other animals - less capable of pain/suffering. There are some arguments out there for switching to it from less efficient sources of livestock, though obviously the cultural/disgust barriers are high. * There's an important distinction between whether it's *meat eating* or *what we do that allows to eat meat* that is the moral consideration, and I think clearly the latter is the important one when it comes to morality. And what we do that allows us to eat meat can vary from *horrible* to arguably doing more good than harm."

CMV: Vegetarianism and veganism are not ethically or morally superior to consuming meat.,Plane-arium,0,"&gt;I don't believe that there are any moral implications here. Chickens are too stupid to realize that they are being farmed, and are likely content that they don't have to worry about finding food and shelter, predators, or disease. The same can be said of cows (milk, meat, and veal) and pigs. &gt;It is the moral responsibility of humanity to care for animals &gt;1. Farm animals are cared for. I think these are the most important parts of your argument. Did you know cows actually experience depression? Cows in herds actually have """"friends"""" and when those friends are taken away the cow goes through similar emotions as we do. [See animal emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_in_animals). You seem to view all farm animals as """"dumb"""" or devoid of emotions. That's problematic. Assuming you believe in evolution (apparently that's a huge assumption these days) all mammals share common ancestry. Our brains, and bodies developed in tandem and are rooted in very similar foundations. Simply because an animal has """"rudimentary"""" or basic conceptions of feeling, [and may lack sentience](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159106001110) doesn't mean they don't experience suffering or pleasure in some way. You also seem to ignore the factory farm issue. And simply assert that """"animals are cared for."""" I'm warning you that the following link is graphic, shocking, and served to change my life and outlook on treatment of animals. [WARNING: DISTRUBING](https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=7ce_1367100652) Additional factory farm abuse videos: https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=375_1385298917 https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=375_1385298917 I dislike these videos, not only because of content, but also because of the superimposed text. The acts themselves are cruel, the text does nothing to sway my opinion, ignore the writing and focus more on the actual cruelty. Is it okay to throw chickens around because you think """"they're dumb animals"""" and """"they're incapable of experiencing pain and sadness"""". Yes, Veganism can be an overreaction. As long as hens are cared for, cows are treated well, and bees are producing anyway, we might as well take advantage of those products. That's a fair supposition. One I agree with. And yes, domestication of animals has removed them from the """"state of nature"""" where a predator can tear a pig apart and eat it alive. That's a good thing to be sure, but is it still okay to say that """"suffering at our hands is better than the alternative""""? You also argue that """"a lion doesn't treat an antelope well, why should we?"""" I think that's a poor argument simply because we are rational, we are reasonable, we are empathetic. We are the most intellectually gifted animals on the planet. Humanity is an affront to nature. While a Lion has no other means to kill its prey without causing suffering, WE DO. We can make the whole process much less gruesome, painful, and cruel. So we should. I'm no vegan or vegetarian, but I understand the """"animal suffering"""" moral argument. If I could ensure that my burger came from an open field farm and the cow was treated with care and dignity I would absolutely pay extra for the cost of that care. The problem is the good farms and the factory farm are so far removed from the process of consuming the food that we cannot possibly ensure that."
CMV: Vegetarianism and veganism are not ethically or morally superior to consuming meat.,omid_,0,"&gt;Humans and our relatives have consumed animal products from the beginning, as we are a 'take what you can get' species. So what? Just because something was done in the past doesn't mean we ought to do it today. &gt;A diet that does not contain animal products pretty much necessitates supplements. No? I've been vegan for over a year now and I don't take any supplements. According to you, I and millions of others should be literally dead or hospitalized. Yet we're not. &gt;Inefficient =/= moral or ethically wrong. Actually, in my moral view (utilitarianism), inefficiency is absolutely a moral wrong because of the opportunity cost. Factory farming contributes around 10%-30% of greenhouse gas emissions. 1/3 of arable land is used for feed crops rather than just growing food for humans directly. That's immoral because we could be solving hunger and climate change much more easily, and less people would suffer, if we stop with the torture &amp; slaughter of animals. &gt;that is because there will be fewer of those animals. Right. That's exactly the point though. The amount of cows on Earth is completely unnatural and is causing a massive amount of problems. There should be far less cows. I'd rather 1,000,000 extremely happy cows than a billion miserable ones. &gt;Whatever populations are left once breeding is discontinued will be hunted by their natural predators Okay and... so what? The point is there will be far less suffering, for both humans AND other animals. Why is that bad? &gt;Bees produce honey anyway For themselves, not for humans. We're taking away from their food storage for no good reason. &gt;chickens lay eggs anyway But those chickens shouldn't exist in the first place. Eggs are not free. You have to feed the chickens something like 10x the energy you'd receive from an egg. It's inefficient. &gt;cows produce milk anyway Cows only produce milk the same way humans only produce milk: after becoming pregnant &amp; having a baby. That milk is made for the baby. The only way to get that milk is to deny the baby that milk. And again, it's not like the milk is free. &gt; all animals die anyway. Yeah, of old age. Cows can live around 20 years. They get slaughtered around 2-4 years old. Chickens can live around 10 years. They get slaughtered around 2-4 years as well. They aren't just dying. They are being systematically killed and denied a long &amp; happy life. &gt;on a farm, these resources are harvested for the good of another species. That's... not how it works. That's not how anything works. TANSTAAFL. We are expending so many resources for energy inefficient food and it's literally polluting our planet, and contributing to global hunger. Why is it a good thing again? &gt;Chickens are too stupid Oh, so it's just a matter of stupidity? So you have no problem treating very stupid humans the way chickens are treated? Having their mouths cut off, forced to live in pens where they can't even turn their bodies, slaughtered a year or so after reaching puberty? """"But humans are special"""", no we're not. We have the same pain receptors that chickens do. &gt;The same can be said of cows Cows are among the most intelligent mammals in Earth. They like to play with toys, make best friends, solve mazes, and be friendly towards humans: &gt;&gt;They are also able to discriminate between familiar individuals, and among humans. Cattle can tell the difference between familiar and unfamiliar animals of the same species (conspecifics). Studies show they behave less aggressively toward familiar individuals when they are forming a new group.[53] Calves can also discriminate between humans based on previous experience, as shown by approaching those who handled them positively and avoiding those who handled them aversively.[54] Although cattle can discriminate between humans by their faces alone, they also use other cues such as the color of clothes when these are available.[55] &gt;pigs Pigs are about the same intelligence as dogs, if not smarter. But in any case, what does it matter how smart they are? The only thing that matters is whether they are sentient. If they can feel pain, then we need to avoid inflicting it on them needlessly, for the same reason why should avoid inflicting pain on other humans needlessly. &gt;Farm animals do not. Yes, they do. We know this. We have measured this. When a baby cow is taken from her mother (so that humans take her milk rather than the baby), the mother becomes incredibly stressed out and starts hollering in agony. Again, we're not that different. Cows have hormones and neurotransmitters just like humans. When they are happy, it's from serotonin and cannabinoids. When they are stressed, it's from cortisol and epinephrine. They don't have a fully developed prefrontal cortex like we do but that's not where pain &amp; fear are processed in the mammalian brain. They have amygdala just like we do. In my view, cows that are a part of human society should be treated no differently than a severely developmentally disabled human. &gt;A lion does not treat an antelope with anywhere near the same courtesy a human hunter/farmer would. There are only 30,000 lions in the wild. Over 100 billion animals are slaughtered annually. Not even close to the same scale of suffering. &gt;Does a bee care that its excess honey is """"stolen"""" from it? Well, they don't have the intellectual capacity to understand farming. But obviously they will suffer if they run out of food because we took all their stored food. In any case, bees are very different from our fellow mammals. &gt;Does the chicken care that its worthless unfertilized egg is """"stolen"""" from it? Well, yeah. They do get upset if they see you take their eggs. That's what they have evolved to do: defend their eggs. Because the ones who didn't have an instinct to defend their eggs went extinct. We're talking about animals that are smart enough to [play fetch](https://youtu.be/NvKNmjpt0QA). Sorry, but if I can play with another creature and we both get something out of it, then we shouldn't be eating him or her. &gt;a human would not care if a burglar stole only his garbage Again, eggs aren't free. They come at a price of all the food &amp; water &amp; heating used to keep the chickens alive, which is better used elsewhere. &gt;come from necessity, utility, or reduction of suffering. Meat is 100% unnecessary for human survival. In fact, it's detrimental to our survival because it reduces global food supply &amp; contributes to climate change. &gt;Pets provide utility in being a companion, farm animals provide utility in the creation of resources. But people can find companionship with cows, chickens, pigs, and other farm animals too. They are our friends, not food. And they are not a creation of resources. They are a **drain** on our resources due to how immensely energy inefficient they are. &gt;if someone placed a platter of dog in front of me, I would eat it without hesitation.

Milk is produced only by a mammal that is pregnant or has just recently given birth. The babies are typically removed from the mother as soon as possible and killed for meat. This is the typical source of veal. As for eggs, the problem is: what happens to the chickens after they stop laying eggs? A typical hen lays eggs for maybe a couple of years, but lives for well over ten. A hen that ceases to lay eggs is generally sent to the slaughterhouse. And of course it doesn't really stop there. Glycerin in soap is often produced from animal fat. Gelatin in jellybeans is manufactures from bone and gristle. Animal products truly are pervasive in our culture, so it is very difficult to truly avoid all of them. But you asked about animal testing. I can't claim that my actions totally match my words here, but I think that you need to be clear about what rights animals do and do not have, and what constitutes a reason for denying them these rights. Throughout the mid-twentieth century, several governments tested various medical products on humans. The Germans tested on Jews, the Japanese tested on Chinese, and the Americans tested on the mentally handicapped.

Using its technological know how and driven by it's appetite for red meat it herds humans up and begins to farm us. The alien also likes human milk and eats the young as a delicacy (like humans eat lambs and drink cows milk). Is the Alien unethical?. It's doing exactly what humans do to """"lesser"""" animals. Let's say for the narratives sake that the Alien simply sees humans the way many humans see cows,pigs etc. Sure we have our cute technology but the alien has evolved so far beyond humans current state that it sees no value in us other than as a potential resource. Essentially we'd be as helpless as the animals we imprison for our own devices. The pain and suffering that these animals feel is as real as a humans. Some mammals develop strong bonds with their offspring. How do we measure the emotional bonds shattered and or cruelty of a female cow having its young torn away from it?. We don't! We ignore that the possibility could exist . For it it did, we would be the monster and the innocent young cow etc would be the victim of cruelly. Of course this narrative assumes that cows have a conscious that will feel fear and suffering. And most humans presume a cow dosnt have the aptitude to feel anything.

CMV:Having a vegan diet seems pretty pointless.,weirdestjourneyever,1,"In my sort-of-uninformed opinion, the moral argument is not the only one that exists for either vegetarianism or veganism. I share your viewpoint that a person not buying the products doesn't really make a dent in the industry itself. But I'd gladly go vegetarian if it was convenient to do so right now (just finished high school, still living with parent). Why? Because there's also a personal argument to be made. -A *planned and monitored* vegetarian diet visibly provides health benefits across the board, such as less risk of stroke, obesity, diabetes, drastically reduced cholesterol, and overall healthier appearance and even the mitigation of random, seemingly unrelated conditions, such as psoriasis and acne. Processed meat, on the other hand, has been declared by the WHO as a literal carcinogen. -It's much easier to improve productivity for crops than it is for livestock. Intensive animal farming often includes the abuse of hormonal medication, antibiotics, fattening substances just to be marketable; and on the other hand, GMO research has made it so you can induce plants to yield more, be healthier, tastier, and grow faster, all at the same time, without potentially leaking industrial chemicals, hormones and low-end cattle medication developed during the 80s into the end consumers' guts. Not to mention disease. Everything that gets in an animal's body spends time there, sometimes years, and it doesn't magically go away once its dead, butchered and served on your table. Neither does it do that when its in your stomach. Some have compared eating meat on a daily basis to unprotected sex with random strangers, which, although extreme, doesn't really stray far from reality. -Advances in nutritional science have made it so you literally don't need meat at all as an exclusive source of protein. You could go further and say you don't need meat at all *for anything*, considering the wide varieties of supplements available in the market. If you want to obtain them naturally, then you'd find being a Pescetarian (Like being vegetarian, but excluding fish from the list of things you can't eat) gets you completely covered. Many Asian countries have subsisted on such a diet for centuries, and as a result, often have a far lower incidence of disease and vitamin deficit than westerners. Fish can easily become tainted too, however, but I'd wager it's rare to see a fisherman literally shoving hormones and medications down a fish's throat, throwing it down to the sea, and then scooping it back up a few months later when its become fattened enough to be sold. And it's easy to make the jump from health-oriented vegetarianism to health-oriented veganism. Cheese, milk, yogurt, eggs, ice cream, butter, and milk chocolate are all things that can be easily replaced by healthy alternatives, and most of those have low nutritional content. In the end, it boils down to personal preference. The health benefits are obvious, so the health argument stands, and even the moral argument isn't 'pointless'; absolving yourself from guilt and boycotting a cruel industry can make people feel better, and if it does make them feel better, there was a point."

It's undeniable (you can convince yourself of this in 30 minutes just by Googling) that breeding animals for human consumption produces a significant amount of global warming, as does growing crops to feed animals (eg: corn is primarily grown to feed animals). It's also undeniable that today's factory farming is terrible for animals, particularly chickens. The fact that the industry is lobbying for laws against even recording what goes on inside factory farms tells you everything you need to know about how bad it is - seriously - go to Youtube and look at videos. So if you want to seriously dedicate yourself to the proposition of doing your part to cut environmental pollution / global warming and also reduce animal suffering, you would abandon animal product consumption entirely, not just in parts, and certainly not just the easy part where you pick and choose (""""I love meat, but I'll just give up eating chickens, because they're treated the worst""""). To vegans, that's like saying, """"Alcohol is bad for me, so I'll give up drinking beer and just drink wine and spirits instead."""" As meat eaters (I am one) - I can understand why people are vegans, but for those of us that aren't, I think the major reasons are: 1. We either don't believe at all, or don't believe strongly in the environmental destruction / animal welfare arguments underpinning becoming a vegitarian/vegan 2. We might believe strongly, but aren't willing to give up eating meat / products out of convenience, or the desire to 'do what we've always done' is just too strong. I think most people can't even get past #1, because they're unwilling to consider that a practice pretty much everyone does (eating meat / products) is really that harmful to the environment or animals, or that either of those things is that important.

CMV:Having a vegan diet seems pretty pointless.,pretty_floralbonnet,0,"It's not about taking food from innocent/helpless animals. I'm going to assume we are talking about the large scale dairy industry here. I saw you mentioned in another comment that your family has a small dairy farm, but I must stress how insignificant that is when discussing the overall industry. The vast majority of people are not buying from small local dairy farms. Cows are forcibly, repeatedly impregnated. This means that someone has to stick their arms in both the cows vagina and anus to successfully impregnate it. Then when these cows give birth, their calves are taken away from them as soon as possible. The female calves will meet the same fate and the male calves are either auctioned off to be raised and killed for meat, 'milked' for semen, or just straight out killed. Mother cows cry for their stolen calves, you can look this up on YouTube. These dairy cows are also kept in horribly confined spaces, not allowed the basic right to roam, and are stuffed full of hormones and antibiotics that are going into your milk. The dairy industry is brutally disgusting. Then on to eggs. Again, speaking about the large scale industry. Chickens are also kept in deplorable conditions. You can YouTube this. They often have their beaks cut off from an early age so they don't run the risk of pecking each other, which is inevitable in such confined spaces. And do you know what happens to male Chicks in the egg industry? They are put in a grinder. Millions of baby Chicks are literally ground to death. Again. Brutally disgusting. It's naive to think the egg and dairy industry doesn't harm animals. It's the same level of abuse as the meat industry and still results in death. Because after a cow or chicken can no longer produce milk or eggs, guess what happens to them? They're killed. Those are the tangible reasons for veganism. There's also the school of thought that a lot of us believe that animals are not here for us to use. Yes, cows naturally produce milk. For their calves..not for humans. Cow milk is biologically designed to turn a baby calf into a 400 pound cow. It is not designed for human consumption. It's egotistical to assume that humans have a right to forcibly take it from them. The same goes for eggs. Yes, chickens naturally produce eggs. So do Robins, snakes, and turtles. If you saw a turtle egg lying on the ground, would you pick it up and take it home for your breakfast? Eggs are basically the chicken equivalent of a period, so why anyone finds that appetising is a CMV in itself. So basically, 'it's not like it hurts a chicken to take its unfertilized eggs or a cow to take its milk' is the problem here. Yes, it very much does.

CMV:Having a vegan diet seems pretty pointless.,happyprocrastination,1,"&gt; the reason vegans avoid buying or eating animal products is because it's taking food from innocent and/or helpless animals. This seems like strange reasoning because it's not like it hurts a chicken to take its unfertilized eggs or a cow to take its milk to turn into butter or cheese. The chicken will continue to lay eggs weather we collect them or not, and a cow will keep producing milk as long as we keep taking it. Ok, correct ME if I am wrong here again, but I believe you are misinformed here. It is late in the evening and I am too lazy now, but I might try to back up my claims with sources if needed: * For most vegans, taking from innocent animals itself is not the main reason. For some of them, it might be that it is questionable whether stuff produced by and for other animals is healthy if consumed by humans (that is: healthier than just eating plants - it is definitely NOT basically essential as those industries like to claim sometimes). But mostly, also for me, it is the way in which cows and chicken are treated. * Most cows and chicken nowadays are bred so that they lay way more eggs and produce much more milk than they originally would have. It is true that not getting rid of the milk might be painful for the cow, but so is producing and carrying this much milk in the first place, and so is laying an egg that often for a chicken. * Chicken and cows, even the """"humanely"""" treated ones often do not have enough space or adequate treatment. Of course way worse for factory farming with cows barely able to move, their udders almost dragging them to the ground and chicken in battery cages or extremely crowded spaces. Chicken will often get their beaks cut so they don't attack each other. * You need to raise chicken to lay eggs, so you need to breed quite of them. Male chicks are useless to the egg industry. Methods to determine gender before birth are researched, but not really implemented (yet). It is still common practice to sort chicks after birth into the genders and to throw males into a grinder alive directly after birth, or to gas them. * Cows are often forcefully inseminated because they give more milk when they have a calf. Since we want to take the milk, we separate calves and mother cows directly after birth, which puts both under distress. The females get raised to give milk later on. The males.... well, you can imagine. So as you can see, the dairy and egg industry still cause a lot of suffering and/or death to its animals. You could probably solve the problem with grinding the male chicks but the others not so much, especially not with the levels of consumption that are normal in the western world. Also, since both are relatively intelligent species, I think it is not moral to """"give"""" those animals a life during which they do nothing but being exploited by humans, especially not under the current circumstances and just because it is utterly unnecessary. These industries also still have a large environmental impact. I guess many vegans would be ok with humans getting some of the milk or some eggs, if and only if the animals are treated adequately and have a fulfilled life basically in the wild without dying as prematurely as they do nowadays. That would mean however that dairy and egg products would need to be a very expensive high-end product, because otherwise it practically impossible to achieve such standards with the number of people that live on this planet."

CMV:Having a vegan diet seems pretty pointless.,Kevim_A,1,"1.) Animal cruelty. A vegan will argue that the conditions a large portion of cows/chickens live in to produce milk/eggs are unethical. Egg laying chickens are often confined to 1x1 spaces for the majority of their lives, laying eggs into large conveyer belt systems to make collection more streamlined. Milk cows are often over-milked and given very little freedom of movement. It is often argued that dairy cows have much worse conditions than cattle raised for meat because of the confined living conditions of the dairy cow and amount of """"work"""" it does through constant milking. So, the moral argument of the vegan could be: """"I think the treatment of these animals is unethical, and I don't want to support an unethical industry. Hopefully my own and others with a vegan diet's lack of contribution to the market will eventually cause less demand, lesssened production, and therefore less animals in poor conditions."""" 2.) Environmental. A vegan will argue that raising animals--whether for meat or not--is bad for the environment. Dairy cows produce methane just like meat cows do. Also you have to grow the plants to feed the cows, the cows' milk doesn't produce as many calories as you have to feed it, and you have to hydrate the cows themselves. So producing dairy requires more water than an equivalent amount of calories in many kinds of vegetables (but not all) would. Due to the law of energy transfer, ALL animal products will produce less calories than they take in, and so we could use less land and pollute less if instead of using land to feed animals to feed us, we cut out the middle part and just use land to feed us. The end game isn't about the *current* chickens and current cows producing food. It's about lowering overall demand and consumption of animal product to reduce total suffering and total damage to the environment. And of course, there are those that do it for health reasons. There are people who simply prefer a vegan diet. And I am not even saying that the vegans who do it for the environment or to stop animal cruelty are necessarily going about their goals in best way or are entirely accurate in their claims. But, their reasons certainly aren't pointless or without logic."
CMV:Having a vegan diet seems pretty pointless.,vipertree,0,"I'm vegan and live on a farm where dairy cows and egg chickens are raised.

In the case of milk, cows are NOT simply going to produce milk anyway. You have to force them to be pregnant for a significant proportion of their lives. Being pregnant can be a shitty experience and takes a real toll on one's body. Either way, there is a fundamental lack of respect for animal autonomy when you use them for food. If a chicken walks by and poops out an egg on my doorstep, I wouldn't feel too bad about eating it.

CMV:Having a vegan diet seems pretty pointless.,Titiartichaud,0,"&gt; This seems like strange reasoning because it's not like it hurts a chicken to take its unfertilized eggs or a cow to take its milk to turn into butter or cheese. The chicken will continue to lay eggs weather we collect them or not, and a cow will keep producing milk as long as we keep taking it. I understand perfectly why people think that but it's really not the case. For starters you talk about """"buying"""", this implies some level of commercialisation of those products. In pretty much all such farms, animals will end up slaughtered and in their lives a lot of horrible stuff [(dairy for example)](https://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/44ggct/unbiased_sources_about_practices_in_the_dairy/) happens to them. Slaughter might happen later in their time in the system in smaller farms but it sill happens. We are against that obviously because no such product is worth an animal's life when we have alternatives. We also do not believe in the concept of """"humane slaughter"""" because it makes no sense. Here is a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XFVS2S1fN0) explaining why we think this concept is not logical. Then you have the situation where you do not kill the animals. When it comes to milk, you'll have a little issue on your hands with all the male babies who are born and quite useless. What do you do with that? If you want your milk to be available to a wide range of people with reasonable prices, you have to get rid of them. But then again, let's assume they are fine and they somehow manage to keep them around. Then you have a mother who is lactating for her calf and since in this situation, it's supposedly ethical, there is no way they are separated because this causes incredible amounts of stress to both mother and baby. So what do you do? You have this baby consuming this milk that you'd like for yourself. Either you let the baby and you get almost nothing or you replace part of the milk with some formula. Which is suboptimal of course and it becomes unethical again. Why? You make a baby have a suboptimal diet because YOU want the milk. When you don't need it. That's messed up. Also you have to prevent the baby from nursing which is also very stressful for both. Let's take the situation where the mother produces more milk than the baby needs. This happens. Why? Because we bred cows like that and it's making them sick. If you have dairy farmers in your family you must be familiar with both mastitis and [milk fever.](http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/agriculture/pests-diseases-and-weeds/animal-diseases/beef-and-dairy-cows/milk-fever-hypocalcaemia-in-cows) Producing too much milk and the machinery used to pump will make them sick. Just the production will make them so sick because calcium is drained out of their bodies into the milk. So by breeding them that way, we made them sick by the simple act of giving birth and lactating for their babies. That's deeply messed up to harness such basic biological processes and turn them to our advantage with complete disregard for their needs and health. The simple act of breeding them is messed up and should be stopped the way people agree that certain breeds of dogs should not be bred anymore. We hurt them by making them that way. Cows aren't the only ones in the situation. Chickens in their wild form will produce about 24 eggs a year. That's very far from the 200+ of the current laying breeds. So you go back to the basic issues as for dairy. The males are useless and are killed at birth and if you find farms where it's not the case, it's still messed up to make them sick for our profit. Osteoporosis is a problem in laying hens. [Sources](https://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/4mevo7/seriouswhat_is_your_opinion_on_farm_fresh_eggs/d3uzhh4/). Once again, I say that breeding them is unethical and should be stopped."

Same with cheese : in a village near me these guys keep their goats and produce their own cheese - I've seen them work, and it's all fine by me - nothing like what happens in the big milk farms (cow is brutally inseminated by some guy, gives birth, lamb is taken to be slaughtered and cow is milked dry then slaughtered as well - too lazy to give sources but it's all well documented and known nowadays). Honey is fine, too - it's a case of mutualization, where both species benefit from the action. By any encyclopedic definition though, it's still -partly- an animal (by)product.

Although studies can vary and be biased, you could find arguments for either side. But it's hard to deny that eating a diet of mainly fresh fruits, vegetables, legumes, etc would be bad for you. I say this because there are unhealthy foods that are free of animal-products (e.g It;s not healthy to eat 3 bags of potato chips, even though they are vegan). *The environmental impact of raising animals for food products: The amount of resources used to raise livestock is exponentially higher than that of simply growing plant crops. The amount of land needed, water needed, carbon emissions expelled in the process of making 100 calories of beef, are WAY higher than making 100 calories of any plant product. I believe one of the main reason for the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest is to make grazing for livestock. This is just a basic summary of what I've read about vegan diets. You can find more online if interested, but I have noticed it's a difficult topic to get actual facts. The topic of nutrition in general seems very cluttered with opinions. I am also not a vegan. But it is a very respectable life decision in my opinion, and extremely hard to argue against. FWIW a lot of people look on vegans because they think they come off as smug and elitist."
CMV:Having a vegan diet seems pretty pointless.,king2ndthe3rd,0,"There is no concrete reason people are vegetarian/vegan. It varies from person to person, and you seem to think it is primarily based off of the cruelty factor and not wanting to """"abuse"""" animals for their meat and goods- which is wrong. Most peoples reason for becoming vegan or vegetarian is for the environment, some are for health reasons and some are just for the dislike of meat in its entirety. Yes, the chicken will continue to lay eggs and the cow will still produce milk but we overbreed their populations so much- there are more than a few billion chicken on this planet for example."

CMV:Having a vegan diet seems pretty pointless.,grass_type,0,"Veganism and animal welfare aren't the same thing. The only vegan I knew for any substantial length of time was mostly doing it to improve his discipline and meal planning skills - which worked, as far as I could tell, the lunches he brought to work were always substantially cheaper and healthier than mine. As long as you get enough protein and amino acids, it can be healthier than the average omnivorous diet. If someone is going vegan for welfare reasons, there are some arguments to be made, I guess. You could claim that the raising of animals in captivity is inherently cruel, or that the majority of the industries involved are unavoidably cruel (you can buy cruelty-free eggs, but almost every restaurant is still going to go for the cheapest option of acceptable quality, and that means factory farms). If you're really crunchy granola, maybe you think animals have legal personhood and the eggs a chicken lays belong to that chicken. Now - obviously - I think all of that is fairly silly, and quite enjoy filling my body with tasty, tasty flesh. But I can't deny that I'd probably have lower blood pressure if I ate fewer cheeseburgers and more salads. Disentangled from our species' misplaced empathy reflex, veganism is just """"eat more plant matter, because that's good for you"""" extended to a stricter, formalized diet. Much like keeping a religious dietary restriction, I suspect some of the draw is in the challenge. On the other hand, humans did evolve with an omnivorous diet, and while you can compensate around the absence of meat, you do actually need to explicitly do so, or you will be malnourished. tldr- there are some health benefits to veganism, although it's far from a magic bullet and does have some tradeoffs. Not all vegans are evangelical about it - if someone is a sanctimonious prick about their dietary habits, they're probably just a sanctimonious prick in general. Animal welfare might be a legitimate issue one day, but I'd rather deal with all the humans dying in horrible ways first before we worry about the animals that exist only to be delicious."

CMV:Having a vegan diet seems pretty pointless.,NihiloZero,0,In addition the ethical and environmental reasons already mentioned... many vegans maintain their diet for nutritional reasons.

"CMV: I think it's morally ok to kill an animal for food, but I'm a vegan because I hate the way animals are treated, for such food..",llieaay,0,"&gt; I've always thought that killing an animal for the right purpose, food and not fun ... Well first, in the presence of a wealth of vegan options the distinction between *food* and *fun* becomes really weak. We'd be killing animals for foods we like better than other foods. Which is pleasure and convenience. This is obviously distinct from a situation where healthy vegan foods are not available. In that case, and only that case can you say you are killing because you need to eat for food. &gt; ... is morally right because there animals don't understand death, like a human does. This is really shaky ground. Small children don't understand death, for example. What's way more important is that the animal understands life! They form relationships and love other animals. They find pleasure and have activities they enjoy. Killing them is taking all of that away from them. Even though animals may not fully grasp death, they all very clearly avoid it. Animals don't want to be harmed and they don't want to die. And they want to continue doing all the animal things that they love to do."

I think it's impossible to have a moral stance on eating meat/vegetables in general, not necessarily on a case by case basis. &gt;I've always thought that killing an animal for the right purpose, food and not fun, is morally right because there animals don't understand death, like a human does Allow me to elaborate on this. In a general sense, sentient creatures are capable of moral decisions, and as such, deserve moral consideration as well. If a tiger is trying to eat you, you won't be able to reason with it. You can pledge all the steaks in your fridge in exchange for it leaving you alone, and it won't matter. This is why we don't have moral considerations when it comes to tigers, disregarding endangered status etc. A strict moral vegan would consider eating any plant within the bounds of morality, but consider this. If we were to visit an alien planet, where a race of sentient squash live, is it ok to eat them? The squash feel no pain, but they are self aware, and are capable of reason. If the squash are scared of you and attack you, you could try to reason with them. You could build a relationship that's mutually beneficial. Under the vegan's standard, it would be ok to eat them because they feel no pain. Under a standard as I have posited, it would be immoral to eat the sentient squash, regardless of how they perceive death, or how much they do or don't suffer. &gt;They will have the same wonderful life, in the wild, even if I kill it or not.. That's not so. It's common for wild animals to be on the verge of starvation. It is baseless to claim their lives are wonderful &gt;As for producing animals, in order for food, I also think this is ok as long as the animals are treated right, and fair You will get no argument from me &gt;What i'm also asking is, is it wrong to actually eat meat from these factories? People make it seem like it's horrible, but I just don't know. It's definitely not undeniably right, but if one can avoid causing pain, one should. The problem is that terms like grass fed and humanely raised are subject to no regulation. So any factory farm can claim to be raising their chickens humanely without actually doing so. This doesn't mean being vegan trumps, because combines and harvesters still kill and maim countless animals. You could argue that farmers should take necessary precautions to clear their fields of animals before using their machinery, and label their products """"humanely harvested"""". Without regulation of such a term, it would have the exact same problems as described above"

Different means of measuring produce numbers ranging from 10% to 50% of all greenhouse gas emissions coming from the livestock industry. The higher estimates include into the math the amount of carbon NOT removed from the atmosphere by the trees that are cut down to make space for the animals as well as to grow the food we feed to them, which I think is a valid point to consider.

CMV: Veganism and environmentalism will turn to promoting human extinction after animals have been liberated from human exploitation.,throwingitallofit,0,"&gt;Please change my view. I know this sounds drastic but I fear this will be the future of the human race because of how much importance we place on animals over the lives of humans. Veganism is advancing faster than ever and eating meat is universally considered to be worse than enslaving children. I honestly cannot fathom how you came to believe this...but it's really not true. The [overwhelming majority of humans on Earth eat meat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_by_country). And of vegetarians in the world 1,450 million are vegetarian **by necessity**. That means **only 5% of vegetarians in the world are vegetarian by choice...** Also, all people are not vegan or vegetarian because of environmental reasons (though, I, believe it or not, am). A good chunk of the people in the world who are vegetarian by choice are actually so because of religious reasons! And for them, there is no reason to advocate for the end of the human race as a logical outset of vegetarianism. So...you have to realize that vegetarianism and veganism have not become the massive craze you think they have, especially across the world. Your urban lifestyle is making you think this, but you need to reach outside your microcosm and see the real world! Also, I don't know how you could possibly think most people would save an animal over a human...look at the top 50 charities in the US: the top 12 exclusively help people (number 13, the Smithsonian is responsible for some zoos but also serves mostly the human public and is not a strictly animal welfare group at all), and there is only one charity on the list for nature / animals!

Animal suffering and animals being eaten will continue without humans here anyway, we are the only species capable of and interested in reducing their suffering, why would they want to take us out of the factor even if they did value animals equally or more than human life?

You'll note that the first video you cited misses two key points in its analysis. First, there are no easy ways to wipe out humanity. Nuclear war or conventional mass killings would cause untold damage to the biosphere, ruling those options out. While pandemic disease is often portrayed as wiping out humanity in hollywood movies, this is counterfactual. Disease rarely wipes out a population entirely in nature, more often simply reducing population figures greatly. Climate change and extraterrestrial threats such as an asteroid strike remain the only existential threats to humankind, both unacceptable from an environmentalist perspective due to their damage to the biosphere. Additionally, the video you cite does not operate on a long enough timescale to reveal that the Earth's biosphere has a natural limit. On the timescale of billions of years, the CO2 content of the Earth's atmosphere has been steadily shrinking. Despite the recent addition of anthropogenic climate change, it will continue to do so after humans are gone. In 1 billion years, there will not be enough CO2 in the atmosphere for plants to undergo photosynthesis, dooming most higher life. In 3 billion years, the sun will engulf the Earth entirely as it expands into its red giant phase. Somewhere in between these times, the oceans will boil and the Earth will become entirely uninhabitable to life as we know it. Because of this, the only hope of life to life past its natural expiration is.... Human interference! Only by expanding our civilization to other planets in time to avoid being cooked by the sun can the life of planet Earth be saved. You may be right that there are some environmentalists and vegans/vegetarians who do believe that humanity must go extinct, but these beliefs are not widely accepted and would be considered academically to be incorrect by anyone who seriously studies environmental issues."

If you are unfamiliar with conservation, it is characterized by advocating for the wise use of natural resources. In effect, those who take the conservation stance think that we should be using natural resources in a way that is sustainable for as long as possible. This is in contrast with preservationism which advocates for leaving nature as untouched as possible and exploitationism which advocates for extracting as much value from natural resources at the present time. The former I can see having a possible extreme conclusion that humans are the problem and the latter I can see saying that it is not enviromentalism, but conservationism is certainly a form of enviromentalism that still frames things in terms of what is best for humans. Most serious professionals in the field of natural resource management (you could call them professional enviromentalists) advocate for a mix of preservationism and conservationism. The grander goals are definitely conservation, but with a realization that to achieve these goals preservation is required in select small scale instances.

It's a pretty intriguing topic, after all! So, under the assumptions that Veganism is the decision to pursue a lifestyle in which non-human animals and their byproducts are not used for human wants or human gain, and that this would likely refer to an accidental or otherwise unwanted pregnancy... 1) The decision to delineate between humans and other non-human animals in order to determine life value is speciesist and arbitrary. 2) Humans do not have the right to enforce their own autonomy and will upon non-human animals to utilise them or their byproducts. Essentially, humans do not have the ethical right to *own* animals or kill them. This is because the value of another animal's life is equal to our own. 3) Humans, as with every other animal, do have the right to bodily autonomy; we are all able to decide what happens with our own bodies, and when. 4) Let's assume, (and I'll be drawing heavily from Judith Jarvis Thomson's *""""A Defense of Abortion""""* here if you'd like to read more and haven't already) for the sake of argument, that a foetus is a living human from the moment of conception even though it arguably isn't/may not be so. The carrier of the foetus, the parent, still has a right to their own bodily autonomy; they aren't two tenants who by some misfortune were rented the same apartment, the parent *owns* the house. The foetus does not have the claim right to the parent's uterus - the parent has the right to decide what happens to their body, much like a cow should have the right to decide to have a calf, or a chicken to lay/hatch an egg. It should not be something forced upon them. 5) Therefore, it isn't hypocritical for a vegan to have an abortion, as the foetus has no claim right over the vegan's body, much like humans have no claim right over the bodies of other humans, and non-human animals. This isn't to say anything absolute - there are possibly situations in which an abortion would be unethical or hypocritical, just as much as there are plenty of situations in which an abortion would be ethical. Equally, there are plenty of vegans who are antinatalist insofar as they'll render themselves infertile and thus remove themselves from this moral debate (though their intent is that of being removed from the overcrowded gene pool), and there are vegans who will likely be pro-life or pro-choice. This is just one argument by which it can (hopefully!) be demonstrated that a vegan could have an abortion and not be a hypocrite, after all! :)"

If you object to the killing of animals to produce meat out of ethical concern relating to the well being of the animals then basically the following takes place. 1) Neurological development of a conscious creature allows us to understand whether or not said creature can experience suffering or how deep its experiences can be. 2) If a typical mammal used in food production has a relatively high amount of cognitive potential then harming said animal is bad. 3) Fetuses most likely have a very low cognitive development meaning the concern for them and their well being can be prioritized lower as opposed to other beings with higher cognitivity. 4) If fetuses not only experience less suffering than meat animals but in general have no relevant conscious development which makes them indistinguishable from other living or non living things from a cognitive standpoint then killing them is no worse than killing a mushroom or plant or stepping on an ant or swatting a mosquito. From this point of view, one could genetically modify for example cows in such a way that their brains are extremely underdeveloped so that they are basically just beef on legs growing like a plant. Then from this stand point one cannot argue for their well being. However environmental factors and possible anti capitalist stand points might also factor in ones veganism which allows to say no to eating and killing animals, but also allows for abortions."

CMV: A vegan is inconsistent if pro-choice.,Mortress,0,"A being with more conscious has more ability to suffer. If we would hurt both a human and a worm every day, the human would feel uncomfortable for the rest of the day as well because they expect the pain, feel hopeless, maybe get emotional trauma from the systematic abuse while the worm would only feel the pain when it's applied and forget about it the next moment. Therefore we should weigh the interests of a higher conscious being over that of a lesser conscious one. This doesn't mean that the interests of the higher conscious being always trumps the lesser conscious ones; vegans don't eat animal products because the suffering of the animals is far greater than that of the human when they have to drink soy milk instead of dairy. In the case of abortion we could say the interest of the mother is more important because she is more conscious than the fetus, in early stages of pregnancy the fetus isn't even conscious yet. If the child is unwanted it could ruin the mothers life, in that case it could prevent suffering of the child as well by preventing it to grow up in a bad environment."

CMV: A vegan is inconsistent if pro-choice.,schmuckmulligan,0,"I'm going to take a slightly orthogonal approach here. Your post presumes that veganism is based on a logical platform well designed to alleviate conscious suffering. I would argue that, despite the fact that veganism was founded by those who wished to protect animals from undue harm, the actual rule set is not optimized for that purpose. First, we need a definition of veganism. I suggest the [registration documents of the Vegan Society from 1979](https://www.vegansociety.com/society/memorandum-and-articles-association). It's not a perfect match to veganism in all of its varieties, but it's pretty good and seems in accord with what most vegans actually do: &gt;""""A philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of humans, animals and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals."""" There are two major problems here. The first is that these precepts, *and veganism as it is most often practiced today*, largely ignore the death and suffering of animals that may occur in the growth or harvesting of plant foods (animals killed by insecticides, rodenticides, tillers, etc. can vastly exceed in number those killed in the production of grass-fed meat production). A second problem with the above is that it ignores the non-sentience of many animal species. Oysters, for instance, demonstrate no more sentience than a Venus fly trap does, yet veganism would have you skip the Rockefeller. [Here's](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2010/04/consider_the_oyster.html) a decent article about the issue. So what do we make of this? I argue that veganism, although established by those who care about animal suffering, is simply a rule set that proscribes eating meat or using animals as clothing. This approach almost undoubtedly does a lot of good for animals and draws a clear, easy-to-follow line for practitioners to follow (contrast with, e.g., """"ethical"""" carnivores who eat humanely raised meat -- except when they don't). However, veganism is not about reducing animal suffering, strictly speaking. It's a rule set, plain and simple, that intersects with animal well-being but is not defined by it. Accordingly, abortion is completely irrelevant to veganism. Veganism deliberately abjures the nuance required to compare it with abortion. Therefore, as a rule set not concerned with abortion, veganism and pro choice views are not at all incompatible. (Side note: If you want to get into the philosophical underpinnings of ethical harm reduction, which I argue is a debate other than the one you initially raised, I'm glad to do it. Fetal development will come into play, heavily. Abortion has a whole set of ethical issues that are worth evaluating.) Edit: A word."

CMV: Parents should not force veganism on their kids.,misfit_hog,0,"Hi, nearly vegan here. - I think you bring up some good points, which any parent would need to at least think about. Let's start with the health question. There is evidence that vegan diet can indeed be healthy for children, but also evidence that parents who do not know what they are doing can hurt kids by putting them on a plant based diet. ( small kids have different nutritional needs to adults + they have not build up the resources of B12 adults who go vegan already have in their body, so B12 deficiency can happen far faster if no adequate supplements are given...) - this though simply means that a vegan parent should not put their kid on a vegan diet without doing the research and, ideally, talking it through with the GP. If the parent is not hurting their child they should be fine in that regard. Your second point is the choice aspect of veganism. That one is an interesting question. Any parent, to a certain extent, will impose their morals on their children. There is no way around it. - if you as parent think something is morally wrong, you probably should at least discourage your children from taking part in it. But, you might say, should children have to suffer for being different for the parents' moral? Should a parent forbid their kid to eat the birthday cake at school? Should they control all food collected on Halloween? Personally I think, as kids are old enough to start school, parents should explain their morals in this regard and then let the children decide themselves, but I can see why parents would think otherwise. Some parents might think a 6 year old is to young to personally carry big ethical choices about their food. Most six year olds would happily survive only on fruit loops and spaghetti, after all, how can one expect them to take responsibility for their own eating choices? - some parents might decide """"forbidding"""" a child who normally would not eat non- vegan diet, but would feel bad about explaining it all the time an easy """" out"""", so to speak """" my mum does not allow me to..."""" . Or maybe a parent just worries that a child who previously ate all vegan might have problems digesting non- vegan food all right. Or maybe parents just forbid it, the same they forbid anything else they find morally wrong. Now, non- vegan food at home, bought by the parents with their own money. I disagree with you that parents should have to do that. Providing said parents make sure their children are on a moderately healthy diet ( comparable with the average omnivorous child, not hold to higher standards than this) , I can not see them having any moral obligation to provide their children with a choice they, the parents , see as morally wrong. If the parents are providing adequate nutrition they are not hurting their children and I firmly belief that the only time parents should be forced to change the way they parent is if they are hurting their kids. A point could be made for food the children buy with their own pocket money. I think that one falls into the same, complicated grey area as birthday cake at school. It's the kid's money, so they should use it as they want. - but if what they want is something you see as wrong, if you see yourself as protecting your child from """"bad choices"""", till you can not protect them anymore or have figured they are to old to be protected? - it's the same with other things people forbid their children a choice on, after all. --- Now, I've talked and talked, but I think my summary is that I don't think vegan parents have a strong moral obligation to give their children a choice in eating or not eating vegan, so long as they make sure their children are well taken care off ( and I would argue, if the children have nutritional problems, a vegan parent could usually fix that with vegan food). - that said, giving the children some choice might still be the smart thing to do. Again, I think the points you brought up are important to think about for any vegan who is planning to become a parent, so thanks for the discussion. :)"

People of all ages can healthily be vegans, vegetarians, or omnivores with proper planning and balancing. Whether or not you trust parents to put the proper thought into it is the issue at hand. I would say that vegans need to be careful about their diet in order for it to actually be healthy for them. In that sense I wouldn't be surprised if forced vegan children were healthier than average because their parents are likely to put more thought into it as they do with their own diets. That being said, it comes down to what rights you believe a parent should have in influencing the way their child develops. Should parents be allowed to force any diet on a child that that child will likely keep out of habit for the rest of their life? I feel like this is fairly comparable to asking whether or not parents should have the right to force a religion on a child that they would likely keep for the rest of their life. Your answers to those questions should be the same, and should dictate your view on the subject. Any further looking into health benefits or whatnot is too vague and opens up to much argument.

In other words, a vegan believes that being vegan is ethical and not being vegan is unethical. Presuming for the moment that a vegan diet can provide the essential nutrients for a child (which some others here have argued for), what you are in effect saying is that parents should not be allowed to pass on moral standards to their children. Children (with prefrontal lobes that are not fully developed, such that they are not fully capable of making good moral choices) should instead be allowed to choose which moral standards they follow, rather than abiding by the moral standards that their parents have set for the family. I'm in agreement that parents should do their research to ensure that their children receive a healthful diet, but beyond that, I don't see any reason why parents should not be allowed to set standards (*especially* ethical standards) for their family. When the child grows up, sure, they will be able to choose what sort of diet they will follow.

CMV: Parents should not force veganism on their kids.,conspirized,0,"It's a parents' obligation to provide their child with the best possible upbringing they can provide. One of the most important things you are responsible for teaching your child is how to do what's best for them. You can read books, go to church, ask your parents, consult your pediatrician, and gather all kinds of other information about how other people think it's best to raise your child but ultimately it is *your* responsibility to follow what *you* think is the best route and (if you're not already) when you're a parent that's what you're going to do. As a meat-eater (I'm guessing you are) you believe that it is most beneficial for your child to eat meat as part of their diet - hence why you think other parents should do the same. As a vegan a parent will believe that a vegan diet is what's best for their child and that's what they're going to do. It's no different than saying """"I'm an Atheist, so I'm going to raise my child as an Atheist and everyone else should have to at least expose their child to the concept of Atheism as well."""" Substitute Atheism in that statement with your religion of choice. You're essentially trying to press your views on other people because that's what you believe is best for their children, but that's not your choice to make. Even more relevant: """"I'm against vaccinations because I believe there's a potential health risk so I think that no other parents should vaccinate their children, either."""" You can read shit online all day that says one way or the other, but ultimately you're going to do what you think is best for your child. Women are less likely to contract an STD from sleeping with other women. On top of that getting pregnant carries with it some degree of danger. Should all parents try to raise their daughters to be lesbians that adopt if they want kids? Again - it's potentially more healthy, but some would say forcing a form of sexuality on your child IS mentally abusive even though, in the case of women, being homosexual is probably a more healthy lifestyle. Unless there exists evidence beyond a shadow of a doubt that something is not healthy (or more importantly dangerous) for a child it's not right to tell someone how they should or should not raise their child. For example: strangling your child on a regular basis is very unhealthy and will likely cause both mental and physical damage to the child, no parent should do that. In the case of Veganism, all existing evidence says that a balanced vegan diet is just as healthy if not more so than a balanced diet that includes meat. It's not any more physically or mentally abusive than giving them a moral compass."

In the case of children's diet, you're either forcing your dietary choices on numerous animals, or on your children. In the former case pain and death definitely results.

I think we could improve on this statement a bit. One motivation for being vegetarian or vegan is that you are concerned with the rights of others, even when those others are non-human. The question then is """"what rights do people and animals have?"""" You could then argue that people and animals have the right to bodily autonomy, which is why it's immoral to kill or harm others against their will. This is why it's immoral to kill animals unnecessarily. The right to bodily autonomy does not give you the right to use the body of another against their will. And by that very same logic, we a fetus does not have the right to exist in the mother's womb if she makes the decision to not support it. You wouldn't force someone to give up an organ or have a blood transfusion, these things are all voluntary. Likewise, you shouldn't force a pregnant woman to carry a fetus to term because it's her right to decide what she does with her body. Even though she's causing the death of another being, that being does not have a right to her body. So there we have it, we have a consistent set of morals that allow for both vegetarianism/veganism as well as pro-choice...ism."
Vegetarians (and the like minded) are being hypocritical if they are Pro-Choice. CMV,Sir_Tits_a_lot,0,"As many others have mentioned, pro-choice != pro-abortion. I'm pro-choice because my grandmother was an OBGYN nurse who helped deliver high-risk pregnancies. She also saw many, many DIY abortions gone wrong, which can result in two deaths. I'm pro-choice because I value a woman's life more than a potential life and I would never force someone to be pregnant. I would get an abortion if I ever got pregnant. Now, I'm vegan because I want to reduce animal suffering, which includes human suffering. Embryos can't suffer because they don't have the mental capacity, nervous system, etc. to process pain. Living animals can. Humans can. Cows, chickens, pigs, dogs, cats, they can feel pain. To me, death can sometimes preserve life. For instance, euthanasia. I am fine with euthanizing animals if it means they won't have a life of suffering and pain. &gt; If one is against animal cruelty, then wouldn't one be against a late trimester abortion? My understanding is the majority of late-term abortions are because of risks to the mother. No one *wants* late-term abortions to happen, but sometimes they must."

Vegetarians (and the like minded) are being hypocritical if they are Pro-Choice. CMV,realised,0,"I am going to split up my points into sections - as I cannot seem to coherently link them up: 1. I believe that being a veg is generally a personal choice; it isn't something you do to push on to others. As a male vegetarian, I do believe in pro-choice. After all, that isn't MY decision to make. 2. Eating or removing larvae, eggs and the like may be cruel - but the cruelty is towards biological forms which cannot express their emotions to us humans. Therefore we cannot judge or decide for them whether it is cruel or not. Whereas, pro-choice/abortion is for people we can communicate with; with people we can understand what choices they have in front of them. It may be (as a point of argument) more cruel to allow the fetus to fully develop and be born; the babe may not be loved or the family may not have the capabilities to support it. Would it not be less cruel to prevent this from happening? 3. Extending from the previous point - contraceptives are not 100%. Other pregnancies occur in circumstances that are not entirely foreseeable or even morally/legally correct. In these circumstances, would it not be cruel to have the mother not only have to carry the baby to term (9 months of their life), suffer through the birth, have to suffer through the decision of whether giving the babe up to adoption or keeping it, and then having to live with the regret and guilt? I am not saying feels these emotions - but being provided a choice would help those that do. 4. In the current state of foster homes and economical circumstances, it isn't always best to proceed forth. It may cause unnecessary burden not only on the family but the child, itself. 5. I work as a clinical researcher at a peds hospital, specialising in genetic disorders. The implications of pro-choice are like a dark cloud upon my profession. In one way, we are compared to the eugenics of the Nazi regime; after all we are giving a choice to end a pregancy for babes that have genetic disorders which will either impact their life severely or even cause their death very early on in life. But on the other hand, we are relieving the burden that will be placed on the families which have to live with it. So in conclusion, being a vegs does not necessary mean that you have to be pro-life; but rather that choice depends on the communication to the individual whose choice it is. With animals, we cannot communicate with them to """"assess"""" the suffering and cruelty of our actions - not only on the actual larvae/eggs but also the parents and community surrounding them. But with humans we can, it may sound like a utilitarian approach but that does not necessarily make it wrong or right. Therefore, being pro-choice or pro-life may not be directly impacted by their choice to be vegs; but rather their understanding of the impact of their actions."
Vegetarians (and the like minded) are being hypocritical if they are Pro-Choice. CMV,oiler,0,"First of all, being pro-choice doesn't mean that you are pro-abortion; it means that you think it is better for people to have the option than for the government to ban abortion entirely. I'm a vegetarian and I think it would be great if everyone stopped eating meat. I don't think it would be great if everyone were banned, under penalty of law, from eating meat. Second, the majority of abortions take place before 15 weeks ([91%](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5511a1.htm)), and I don't think anyone is really trying to argue for a 36 week abortion."

When I was vegetarian, sure I hated the idea of slaughtering an animal for someone's future enjoyment for a cheap quick meal, but that wasn't the only reason. Some vegetarians are also concerned about impacts on the climate due to massive factory farms (GHG's from animals, transportation, water pollution from feces), government subsidies for large farms, consuming too many antibiotics through animal products, health reasons, and religious encouragement. These reasons don't have much to do with believing that a women should be able to control her body (pro-choice)."

CMV: The most ethically vegan thing to do is to commit suicide because human population impacts animal life more negatively than eating them.,yyzjertl,0,"It seems to be your view that suicide is the most ethical action.

CMV: The most ethically vegan thing to do is to commit suicide because human population impacts animal life more negatively than eating them.,holomanga,0,"Currently, there is a huge ethical crisis: the one of [wild animal suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_animal_suffering). The vast majority of animals live their lives cold, scared and hungry, until eventually they die a painful death by injury or disease or being eaten. This is terrible, and it's going to keep happening for millions (maybe billions?) of years. The only really ethical thing to do is to wipe out the Earth's ecosystem altogether, and stop it for good. This can be done in either the obvious way (let's cytheriform the fucker), or in the nice way (upload everything to a simulation, move all animals to captivity, something like that). Both of these can be massively accelerated by humans. Until we save the animals, we need to stay alive. For the greater good."
CMV: The most ethically vegan thing to do is to commit suicide because human population impacts animal life more negatively than eating them.,bottlebog,0,"Ethical veganism is just about trying to cause the least amount of harm possible (within reason). Obviously, you could plant fifty trees and then kill yourself and probably have a much smaller carbon footprint, but no ones advocating that because it's about taking reasonable steps to reduce harm where possible. Just because veganism is not the absolute absence of cruelty doesn't make it an invalid response to the issue. By virtue of our existence, we cause some harm -- no way to avoid that. However, that doesn't mean that attempting to minimize that harm isn't worthwhile. People get murdered or robbed all the time, it's not something we can control, but we can choose not to do it ourselves because we ethically want to reduce harm to our fellow humans. Sure, someone could say that harm to other people is inevitable, so why not cause more harm? But we understand that ethically, less suffering is better than more even if we can't end all suffering. This is why we don't punch people, or steal, even though violence and theft are unavoidable facts of life. So sure, vegans aren't perfect. No ones claiming they are. But to say that wanting to minimize harm to animals/the environment means you should kill yourself to neutralize your impact is just a standard you wouldn't apply to someone who eats meat. And say a non-vegan happens to recycle and avoid hitting their pets, would those somehow be pointless stances against pollution and animal abuse that are morally ineffective if not carried to an extreme? Why try to keep plastic out of landfills when it will get there anyway? Why not kill yourself so you're not creating demand for more plastic products? Obviously no one says these things, because we understand that it's reasonable to try and reduce waste even when waste is unavoidable. The fact of its inevitability doesn't make efforts to alleviate it worthless. You're drawing an arbitrary line at eating meat. You're saying that going beyond not abusing pets or hurting animals to refraining from killing and eating them is somehow so radical that you might as well kill yourself if you feel so strongly. But people do other things to help the environment and animals all the time - trying not to waste water, driving electric cars, adopting from animal shelters instead of breeders, etc. Would you pose this same question to someone who drives a Prius, challenging them as to why they'd have the audacity to try to reduce greenhouse gases when their very existence results in increased carbon emissions? Probably not, because they're just doing a pretty logical thing in response to an issue -- making a relatively reasonable, small choice to minimize harm done even when avoiding it altogether isn't possible. And sure, they could quit driving altogether, but they probably have places they need to go and a regular life to lead. Since an electric car helps them reduce harm without limiting their life too much, they do it. Same with people who avoid meat -- it's not the absolute avoidance of all harm, it's just a way to minimize it as much as possible while still leading a regular life. Which, as you can understand, makes suicide a less logical step to take, regardless of the potential for harm-reduction."

CMV: The most ethically vegan thing to do is to commit suicide because human population impacts animal life more negatively than eating them.,Logiq_,1,"If vegans had done this instead of forming organizations and exposing cruel farming practices, there would've been a lot less animal rights advocacy. That advocacy has led to more vegans and vegetarians, more ethical and enforced farming standards, and an emerging market for alternatives to meat. None of this would have happened, at least nearly to the same extent, if vegans were wiped off the earth. Analogously, if all environmentalists had killed themselves to protect the environment, there would've been no one left to advocate for it. Carbon taxes and pollution regulations would have never been adopted. But by influencing companies, policies, and governments, rather than acting solely as individuals, advocates had a much bigger impact on the environment. The recent Paris Accords, for example, will likely help the environment far more than mass suicide would. In general, systemic change is far more influential than individual change because it can stay in effect long after the individuals who supported it have left. And only vegans who stay alive can advocate for that."

The thought of it being an animal which was once alive and is now dead and in front of her is sickening and she loses her appetite.

If your vegetarian friends care only about their health, and think there is a reasonable chance vegetarianism might make them healthier, how is that a 'pop culture' opinion? Reading the news and basing your lifestyle on the evidence presented to you there seems like the absolute opposite of basing your opinions on 'pop culture', unless you think my opinion on the Peso-Yuan currency swap last year was grounded in 'pop culture'."

You give some pretty good reasons in your post, I think: saving animals, and cutting down on greenhouse gas. &gt;Meat helped grow the brain, better the human biology, everything imaginable to make us who we are today. Again, irrelevant. Because something is """"natural"""" does not make it good--or bad or neutral, for that matter. Additionally, because something happened in the past does not mean we should continue to make it happen, especially if new and better alternatives to it occurring arise. In the case of eating meat and animal products, billions of animals suffer and die each year to feed humans. In the process, they hurt the environment a lot in terms of greenhouse gases and otherwise. At the same time, modern agriculture has made healthful abstention from meat and animal products possible (and tasty) for many--if not most--people in the wealthy, Western world. So, veganism is a real alternative to eating meat. And, given the consequences of non-veganism to animals and to the planet, it seems to me that veganism is the preferable option. Also--not that it matters, but I'm curious--why suppose veganism is an insult to evolution, rather than evolution's next stage? And who cares whether evolution is """"insulted"""" or not?

Vitamin B12 is found almost only in animal products, but a vegetarian can get this from eating milk/cheese/dairy etc. A vegan needs can get this from a fortified food/vitamin pills (which are from vegan b-12 sources). 3. Meat may have been an important source of food in our evolutionary path, but to say that we should therefore eat it now does not make sense.

Providing the land, food, and water for animals is intensive - the calorie ratio of plants/meat is lowest in factory farms (after all, they are designed to minimize costs and maximize profit). Humans like meat, and so demand has led to [deforestation in Brazil- here's the UN's FAO on that.](http://www.fao.org/3/a-a0262e.pdf). So even free-range, happy, surprise killed cows might be bad for the world because of environmental impacts. That's a consequentialist worry. Maybe more directly worrisome for you are moral arguments against *killing* animals themselves. There are [many arguments you could consider.](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-animal/) The short answer is that we think that humans are rational and special - and so it is wrong to kill them, use them in experiments without consent, or eat them (except in very extreme circumstances, if ever). The arguments that establish those norms: respect for other being's experiences, or interest in future experience give them rights. Another, more virtue-based view would be that killing-for-use is cruel or demonstrates a deformed emotional core of some sort - when mustered against people or animals."

The question isn't so binary as """"animal research is either good or bad, period"""", but rather """"what types of animal research are legitimate?"""". Loosely, it seems reasonable to say that we need a certain level of net benefit before we should be okay with essentially torturing a being that is capable of suffering. It could very reasonably be argued that if you have a potential cure for cancer, that the benefit outweighs the harm, but there is also a lot of absolute bullshit that is researched which is *completely* unnecessary. For example, it's not very tenable to argue that we need to torture animals in order to test the 10,000th new substance that we'd like to use in makeup products. First of all, makeup isn't exactly a necessity, but even if it was, we've already got enough materials that we know are safe, and finding more is purely just to produce new products for the company to profit off of. We are not furthering any noble causes. There are also a lot of completely pointless things that we do just because it's tradition as well. Things like the Draize test and the LD-50 are not even considered to provide any useful data at all in most cases anymore, and yet we still torture millions of animals with them every year. So there is certainly room for criticism about the things that are done to animals. So essentially, before forcing a being to undergo immense suffering, we should probably evaluate whether the subject of our research is actually valid or important enough. One useful metric that I've seen mentioned is that you should ask yourself if your research is important enough that you would perform the tests on a human being of similar mental ability to the animals you wish to use. If the answer is yes, then the cause is probably worthy, but if not, then you might need to reevaluate what you think you're doing."

Does it matter if you leave your SUV running on idle all day even if you can't see that it directly (albeit, minutely) contributes to climate change? Yes, it does matter (i.e. it has consequences whether or not you are aware of them).

You say """"stopping eating meat will do *virtually* nothing."""" *Virtually nothing* is not nothing and if enough virtually nothings get together you end up with a *definitely something*. Secondly, the very fact that you are posing the question suggests to me that you do think there is something inherently wrong with eating meat (you use the rather evocative word, """"evil""""), but you think that your impact as an individual is negligible when compared with our society of predominantly meat-eaters, and therefor any action you take is a waste on your part (waste of what, I might ask). Here I'll pose another hypothetical: you have an opportunity to cheat someone out of some money. You are the only person who will ever know about it. Your victim will be at a loss (say, he won't be able to feed his family that night, poor sucker), but will never know that it's on account of your cheating.

CMV: I think it makes no difference if I become a vegetarian.,artisanalpotato,0,"Maybe I'm reading your post wrong, but the tangible, near immediate and easily verifiable change is that your LDLc levels will drop through the floor. Ahteroscelerosis is multifactorial, but briefly the initiating steps: When you eat meat, your guts turn all your food into great big fat/chol blobby particles called chylomicrons, these go to your liver, which gets overloaded with more cholesterol than it can process. The liver turns a lot of this into LDL particles to a) supply distal tissues with cholesterol they need (but also) b) to get rid of excess cholesterol and lipids before an ER stress like response gets initiated. The fat and lipids are ultimately destined for muscle and your adipocytes, but the LDL is kind of like a temporary holding area/pool. An evolutionary hack that was never intended to be a production level system. The LDL in circulation is occasionally oxidized from sitting around which makes it an inflammatory particle. Meanwhile, all the salt from your shitty hamburgers are also causing fluid retention and an increase in blood pressure. This leads to micro-fissures in your blood vessels, and occasionally LDL molecules get trapped in this extra-lumenal space. Macrophages and the surrounding cells can do a bit of cleanup here, but they tend to just die and leave more garbage behind if there's too much crap stuck there. So, the particle density of (~ApoB or LDL, but not necessarily LDLc concentration directly) determines the amount of escaping LDL out of where they're supposed to be in your arteries into where they're not supposed to be. Other factors including how inflammatory the macrophages are, blood pressure, the oxidizing or not context (smoking) can worsen or lighten the load. One thing is for sure though, if you're a vegetarian your LDLc will drop through the floor.

So it depends on the person; if you are trying to lose weight, becoming vegetarian could certainly help. The other benefit is the fact that you are making better use of farmland resources. When you eat meat, you are indirectly consuming much more farm productivity, since the additional step in the food chain between vegetables and your stomach incurs losses. This could become critical as droughts and severe weather put a strain on our food production capabilities: a given area of farmland can support many more vegetarians than meat eaters.

And yet, the optimal outcome occurs when both players co-operate.

In other words: **the choice which is in *your* best interest is not always the choice which is in *society's* best interest**. So if you're more interested in advancing society than advancing yourself, the right thing to do is to always co-operate. But what if people are assholes and you really can't trust them to co-operate? Then if society's screwed anyway, you might as well not co-operate to save yourself the trouble, right? Well, surprise, you're no longer co-operating, which means you're acting in self-interest again. People never stop arguing about this because, as you can see, both choices can be justified rationally. You just have to decide what's more important to you: self-interest, or co-operation possibly at your own expense.

True, becoming a vegetarian won't single-handedly and instantaneously bring factory farming to its knees. But that doesn't mean it doesn't make a difference. It's easier and more acceptable to be a vegetarian or vegan than it's ever been before. Simply compare the number and quality of meatless products that exist today vs. what was available a decade or two ago. These, in turn, make it easier and more acceptable for others to forgo animal products. But this didn't happen in a vacuum. Vegans, vegetarians, and people interested in eating fewer animal products have tremendous power as consumers. Major corporations are practically tripping over themselves to develop or acquire vegetarian product lines (Kellogg's owns Morningstar, Kraft owns Boca), and virtually every restaurant these days has at least one vegetarian option. The National Restaurant Association backs this practice, saying that in parties with at least one vegetarian, that person holds the """"veto vote,"""" and can determine whether a restaurant will get the business of the entire group. In other words, making your demand for meatless meals known will make it easier for others to follow in your footsteps. &gt;I don't think it will even save a single cow from being killed. If a many people stop eating meat, then of course damage to the industry can be caused, but it just doesn't matter if a certain individual (For example, me) stops eating meat or not.

Then yes I can make a real difference, but, again, just jumping on the band wagon doesn't do much of anything... As others have mentioned, the simple act of choosing vegetarian meals causes others to reflect on their choices. Many people have an interest in at least reducing their meat consumption, but without examples of people doing so successfully and healthfully, they have little confidence to break out of their old eating habits. Without saying a word, you can influence and encourage others to make different choices. Sure, you could reach more people by taking an activist stance, but each person who chooses to reduce or eliminate their intake of animal products influences those around them, and this effect builds on itself the more people get on board. In summary, every meal is a choice, and your choices represent your values. Expressing your values can influence others to do the same. More concretely, each meal is bought with money. You can choose to support industries that are doing things you believe are evil by giving them money, or not."

For example, I am sure that private and government statisticians can predict quite accurately the total number of traffic deaths that will happen in the U.S. through the rest of the year. BUT, it would be incredibly difficult to figure out *who* is going to die and who is going to live, big-data statistics give us big-population totals.

The idea becomes less foreign, people start thinking about what they eat, they start learning how their body works, and typically they start cutting down on their consumption.

This prompted the school saying no, which brought about a backlash from my friends, which resulted in the teacher line (with all sorts of veggies and fruits as options) becoming open to us. About 10-15 people in my high school became veggie (a phase) but all still have minimal meat consumption and 10 have no meat consumption, and two are vegan. No word on their exact thoughts before the incident, I know one vegan was vegetarian before that event, but the point is, just watching out for yourself and following your morals provides others with similar morals the strength to make those steps. Another anecdote, I went to college and did the same thing, asked for more veggie options in the dining facilities (there were days where there were few veggie options and cereal was getting old). And that ended up having the dining facilities commit to one section to vegetarian/vegan/kosher/gluten free foods. My university ended up getting the #4 vegan friendly school that year, and the cooks made tons of veggie dishes that everyone liked and became favorites.

CMV: I think it makes no difference if I become a vegetarian.,corneliusv,0,"The correct answer is that while there's a very large chance that your decision will make exactly zero impact, there is a small probability that your decision would have a hugely disproportionate impact! Lets use your restaurant/hamburger example. You go to a restaurant that buys meat for 50,000 meals per year. Every customer at the restaurant goes twice a month, or roughly 25 times per year. At the end of every year, the owner decides how much he should plan to purchase for the next year. In year 1, you eat meat, and the restaurant bought the exact right amount of meat to feed its customers, so it makes the same purchase decision for year 2. In year 2, you switch to tofu, and you do not know how many (if any) of the other customers switch to tofu. The restaurant owner will only change his meat purchase decision if he thinks he overpurchased by at least 1,000 units. In this hypothetical decision makes no difference at all if you're the only one to change, or if 38 or fewer other customers changed, because he won't change his purchase order. If 40 or more other customers changed, he would cut his meat purchase by 1,000 meals anyway, so again you made no difference. But if exactly 39 other customers stopped buying meat at that restaurant (either turning veggie or not eating there altogether), then your decision not to eat 25 units of meat will result in 1000 units of meat not being purchased! You will never know whether you made a difference with any particular decision, but if you make enough decisions not to consume meat over the course of your lifetime, the odds are pretty good that 99.99% of those decisions won't matter, but that the 00.01% that do matter will have an impact large enough that you do make a difference by becoming a vegetarian."

In essence, he said: """"It's fine if you want to eat meat. Just don't eat meat every day - that's expensive! Buy meat locally when possible and try to get the stuff that isn't from factory farms. Offset the higher cost by just eating less. The higher quality stuff tastes better, which will make you appreciate it more. It's just better for the environment, your health and your wallet at the end of the day."""" I had never really thought about the issue that way, even though it's so obvious in hindsight. In a few sentences he completely changed my mind. He was completely rational about it and was not preachy like so many other vegetarians I know. I went from eating meat every day (and feeling like I *had to*) to eating meat maybe three times a week. I usually only buy farm fresh eggs, grass-fed beef, free range chicken etc. from local sources now. I know some vegetarians still think that is wrong, but if we have to pick the lesser of two evils then it is pretty clear which is better (eating higher quality, more humanely produced meat less frequently over eating factory farmed meat every day). You don't have to dedicate your life to converting people to vegetarianism to have an effect. Just don't be a dick to other people about what they eat, and if people do talk to you about it, frame the issue not on moral grounds but practical grounds. In a few short sentences, my friend seriously changed the way I thought about meat, and I changed my habits accordingly. If every vegetarian took that approach (and a lot of them do, to be fair), it would have a huge impact I think. My friend changed just one mind (my own) that I'm aware of, but that has lead to me convincing my SO and a few family members of the same thing. We haven't stopped eating meat, but we eat higher quality meat and less of it. Seriously, my friend is indirectly responsible for changing the eating habits of like five people, and probably a lot more that I don't know about. Maybe in the grand scheme of things, that's not much. But every snowball begins with just a few snow flakes."

CMV: I think it makes no difference if I become a vegetarian.,hacksoncode,0,"A given cow or chicken is only slaughtered because they have an order for it. Otherwise they just wait until next week to kill the cow or chicken. And they don't replace those cows or chickens until they need to because they've been slaughtered. It's not a question of """"is this amount noticeable to the producers"""" because probably the answer is no. That doesn't mean that it won't save those animals anyway (temporarily, at a minimum), because they don't operate on much of a speculative basis. Chicken farmers don't even produce eggs for their next generations, because it's more of a hassle/expense than buying them from a specialist egg producer. They only buy as many eggs as they can use in any given week/month. At an absolute minimum, whether you believe it would result in fewer chickens being produced in the long run, your choice to not eat meat means that whatever animals you particularly would have eaten will gain a short amount of extra life. And you really can't ignore the fact that you contribute to reducing demand even if that requires *other* people to contribute to it as well, because, guess what, other people *do* contribute to reducing demand. Maybe it takes a hundred of you to make a measurable impact... take whatever threshold number you want to take... if you don't choose to be a member of that group, it will take that much longer for the group to reach the threshold where they *do* make a difference (whatever you think """"a difference"""" is). Say that in a particular area, it would take 1000 people becoming vegetarian to """"make a difference"""" by your definition, and that in that area one person becomes a vegetarian per month. Your choosing not to become a vegetarian would at a minimum delay """"making a difference"""" by a week. And if a lot of people follow your view, it could take a lot longer. Your view is one that shouldn't be followed widely, if you really think this is a good idea. You should question whether you should hold a view that you personally think shouldn't be held widely. Because the basic principle of many forms of ethics is the Golden Rule, which stated differently is that you should personally refrain from anything where you would prefer that everyone refrain from it."

However, a sufficiently large group of people deciding not to eat meat clearly CAN cause such a change to happen, with relative certainty. And once that number of people chooses to stop eating meat, who are we to say caused the change? Is it the last person who made the decision to not eat meat? I would argue not; that person made as much of a contribution to the group as the first person. So to me it seems that everyone in that group combined to make the change happen.

CMV: I think it makes no difference if I become a vegetarian.,____Matt____,0,"Not buying meat reduces the demand for meat. This reduces the amount suppliers must supply to meet demand. Admittedly, for one person over a short period this isn't a lot. But over a long period, it's probably preventing numerous animals that would live in awful conditions before death from ever being born and experiencing that suffering. Any monumental task that an individual accomplishes can be broken down into small, trivial steps. Any action a large group accomplishes can be broken down into the actions of individuals in that group. In this case, you don't have the weight of 1,000,000 people who immediately stop eating meat, but you have the *average weight* of one of those people, which means your actions matter just as much as if there were 999,999 people willing to do the exact same as you. In every other major social movement, if everyone had the """"but I'm only one person, I do not matter, therefore I will not help"""" attitude, they'd all have failed. Civil rights? Fail. Women's suffrage? Fail. Etc. I'd argue that only eating ethically raised and humanely slaughtered meat is probably a better solution, though (and then also artificial meat when it becomes commercially viable). I'll keep it brief at the risk of going off topic. We live in a market economy, and what you buy matters. If you show there's more money to be made in ethically raised and humanely slaughtered meat, more animals will be ethically raised and humanely slaughtered, thus reducing animal suffering. And this gives producers an incentive to shift in this direction, to court those consumers, who are willing to pay higher prices for the """"same"""" end product. You have more of an individual impact by only eating ethically raised and humanely slaughtered meat than you do eating no meat at all. Plus, it's an easier sell to convince people of. Pay a little bit more and still enjoy your meat, but reduce animal suffering? Not so bad, not so radical or life-changing. Radically change your diet to reduce animal suffering? A much harder sell. And of course, your impact is magnified yet agian by the number of other people you convince. Which means you'll convince more people here, and each will have a greater direct impact on the industry. A better, easier solution."
I think you're a hypocrite if you're a vegetarian/vegan who owns an iPhone. CMV,throwaway83478,0,"The iPhone industry and the meat industry are completely separate entities with different characteristics and need to be treated as such. In addition, one needs to make the assumption that the vegan knows about the problems inherent with the iPhone industry. Let us assume all of the above. One aspect of iPhones is that they are a one-time buy. This means that if one receives an iPhone as a gift or without buying it, then that means they haven't contributed to the labor involved with iPhone production in any way, since they had no control over the phone being bought and paying for reception is paying for a different service than paying for the phone. Now, let us assume said vegan bought the phone himself. At that point, we could call said vegan a hypocrite, but, deep down, he is less of a hypocrite than, say, your average meat-eater. And this will be my claim. Before I explain why, however, I must ask on what grounds you consider that you consider that you should not be put through undeserved suffering, and on what grounds you would insist that, say, me punching you in the face is wrong. The answer cannot be since you are human, as this is independent of you being capable of suffering, and, in any case, I'm sure you would agree that dog-fighting is wrong. You being human (as a justification for above) is a completely arbitrary characteristic that can be likened to you claiming that being white is grounds for being able to hit a black person. The only relevant characteristic that you possess for claiming that you should not be """"punched in the face"""" is that you are capable of feeling pain and suffering. Now, I am certain that every reasonable person would say that they wish not to suffer. And I also would like to claim that the conclusion of my last paragraph leads you to the only way you can claim that you should be entitled to not suffer: You are capable of pain and suffering, and wish others not to push them upon you. And now, you must also recognize that animals are capable of suffering just like people. Now, vegans are vegan since they don't want to contribute to suffering of animals. They, like you, could be contributing to human suffering through buying an iPhone, products made in bad factories, or other goods made through undesirable means. They are just vocal (at times) about trying to do less harm than they would have otherwise done (and that most other people do). As such, every person who contributes at all to suffering is a hypocrite. And a very good way to measure this is by the money they spend knowingly supporting suffering. Vegans and vegetarians will spend less money supporting said suffering, since the costs for meat and dairy over time add up to more than the costs for the hardware in the iPhone. Therefore, a vegan with an iPhone is a hypocrite just like a """"normal"""" person, but less so than most other people since he spends less money contributing to undeserved suffering than a """"normal"""" person."

But let's assume that you are correct that purchasing an iPhone creates as much suffering, compared to not purchasing it, as buying meat does. Even in this case, it doesn't have to be hypocritical. For instance, many people become vegetarians out of concern for animal suffering but still eat cheese. And they acknowledge it'd be even better if they stopped eating cheese. In other words, they are making a sacrifice for the betterment of others without claiming that they are perfect about it. The same applies to charitable giving. I give X% of my income to charity because I believe it does more good for the world than if I spent that money on myself. I also believe it'd be even better if I gave X+1%.

If one put animals and humans on a level playing field, the cruelty done to the animals would be much more severe. I don't think *you* place humans and animals on similar standings like this, but you should be able to see that someone who sees animals differently can come to a different conclusion without being a hypocrite. 2. Feasibility of alternatives - For a vegan, they don't *forgo food*. They find *alternatives* that don't involve the same cruelty to animals. And what they find is not only are the alternatives feasible, they're actually*healthier* in many ways! Contrast this to the smart phone case. Apple is *not* unique in the way they take advantage of Chinese factory workers.

I think you're a hypocrite if you're a vegetarian/vegan who owns an iPhone. CMV,Vogonvor,0,"As a veggie myself I get this and similar arguments quite a lot and they always annoy me because they kind of miss the point of going veggie/vegan. As a vegetarian (and frankly I suspect as an ordinary person) I am of course opposed to suffering of both people and animals. I don't eat meat or wear leather and I try not to shop at places which I know exploit their workers. However I am just one person trying to live my life the best I can. It is very easy not to eat meat these days; it requires very little thought and once you've been veggie a while very little effort. In comparison researching every product which you use to determine whether humans have suffered or not in its production or in the gathering of the raw materials to make it is much much more hard work and much much more time consuming. So that's the first reason for it: because being veggie is easier than committing yourself to researching all the products you use to see if they exploit workers. However there is more to it than that because as I am sure you are aware if you have ever looked into these things it is staggering how many companies do use awful labour practices. To take an example from my area people will often refuse to shop in Primark because they read that they mistreat their workers but what they don't realise is that nearly every major retailer has similar problems at some stage of their production line. Chances are your nice alternative is just as bad but they simply take more profit off it. The trouble is that once you start researching these things you quickly find that you can't use anything which you didn't make/grow yourself or buy from your local farmer's market. It gets kind of ridiculous. It's easy to say you shouldn't buy from say Nike because they mistreat workers but most of the smaller brands are just the same. You don't improve the lives of workers by boycotting the big brands you just make your life miserable. So that's reason two: because frankly the alternatives are usually just as bad as the big brands. This leads me onto my third reason which is that frankly boycotting brands which exploit workers doesn't actually improve the condition of said workers. Like it or not these big companies are often the only source of work for these people and even if you had a national campaign and successfully closed down said nasty factory all that would do is put those same workers out on the streets to do even less pleasant work or indeed to do the same thing at a similar factory which supplies one of the rivals of the company you boycotted. You put a hell of a lot of effort into this but you do very little for the people who are actually being exploited. You would do far better to contribute to charity looking to improve education in these countries. Of course then you'll have a fresh moral quandary as surely a charity educating and protecting exploited workers is not as important as one feeding starving children. So that's reason three: because your actions don't actually benefit those in need. But that brings me onto my final point. There is nothing hypocritical about doing what good you can in a situation. If a man stops by the side of the road to help when there has been a car crash you don't ask why he doesn't go to Africa and build schools you thank him for helping out where he could and for taking the time out of his life to do so. In the same way if a person chooses not to eat meat to reduce the suffering of animals (or at least to feel like they are no longer a part of said suffering) then that should surely be a good thing in itself. Perhaps they don't also volunteer regularly or boycott big brands too but that doesn't diminish what they do do. There is always a better cause out there and we all can only do what we can. Not all veggies are die hard ALF members who devote all their time to helping animals. Most of us are just ordinary people who are trying to live our lives the best we can. We aren't martyrs or campaigners just people trying to do the right thing when we can. Imagine a man takes a homeless person off the street, gives them fresh clothes, a hot meal and a bed for the night and gives them a job at his company. That is a good thing and it would sound crazy if someone told him off because there were people worse off than that particular homeless person and that if he cares about him he should care about them more. So that is the final reason: it is not hypocritical to do good just because we could be doing more good elsewhere. I hope that didn't come across as too combative - as I said I do get this one quite a lot. Hopefully this also will at least explain why personally I don't feel that this is hypocrisy."

If you reduce your meat consumption, fewer animals will actually be produced over time, and each one has an impact on the environment. You could say the same thing about every form of distributed problem. The difficulty is that if everyone thinks that way, we're doomed... moderately literally considering the global clusterfuck that will be caused by climate change. So your view, while literally true, is a harmful one when it is widely believed. If you think that you shouldn't do something where if everyone did it life would be bad, then that's a good enough reason to cut down or eliminate meat consumption."

Because there always tend to be [defectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma), the solutions generally require governmental invervention such as regulation. In other words this will likely remain a problem and your specific actions won't be very important in the grand scheme of things unless a law is passed banning meat consumption. So you are correct in that it might be more pragmatic to direct your resources toward some form of activism than just quietly being a vegetarian. However I would like to point out to you that the tragedy of the commons wouldn't be a problem if there weren't defectors; this whole problem is really the result of people being selfish. Ask yourself if everyone in the world were like you, would this still be a problem? In other words, would they use the argument of your OP to decide not do anything about the problem? Or would they, since they all collectively think that meat consumption is problematic, decide to stop eating meat?

"CMV: One person's consumption of meat has such an inconsequential impact on a global-scale, therefore becoming vegetarian to reduce global environmental impact is pointless.",pappypapaya,0,"Think about this instead as what is needed for a social movement, like vegetarianism, to spread through a population. What you need is a critical mass of early adopters beyond which (the so called """"tipping point"""") the social movement starts rapidly picking up steam and becomes mainstream (an S curve). An example of this is the rapid change in majority attitude towards gay marriage in the last few years. You say that the main factor that prevents you from becoming vegetarian is that an individual's contribution is miniscule. However, I bet if it happens that everyone you knew started becoming vegetarian, you'd find it much easier to make the transition yourself, even though your argument about an individual's contribution being miniscule is still valid. People find it much easier to joint a social movement when everyone else in their immediate social network is. There's a strong social component to personal satisfaction. From this, I would argue in favor of becoming more vegetarian because, if you really care about this issue, it's not about your individual but miniscule contribution to global environmental impact, but about your individual contribution to reaching a critical mass of early adopters, and how you will, when critical mass is achieved, influence the actions of those in your social network. Moreover, early adopters have a larger than average effect on the course of a social movement. As for actually becoming more vegetarian, it's much easier to think about it in terms of degree than as a binary. You can pledge to eat *less* meat than you currently do, such as avoiding eating meat on particular days of the week, or buying less meat when you go shopping or when you dine out. You don't need to eat meat every day to enjoy eating meat (and you'd might enjoy it more if it was a rarer thing in your life). Moreover, there are personal benefits to eating less meat. You'll eat more vegetables and fruits and whole grains in total, which is healthier, cheaper, and more diverse in options. So it has potentially non-trivial benefits for the individual, probably more so than most cases of early adoption."

It is one thing to kill an animal, and it is another thing to torture one before you kill it. Or would you rather the babies in your analogy be kept in their own shit without the ability to move for years before they died rather than simply to die. Would you yourself rather live a decent life and be killed later for food or live a shitty life and be killed later for food? I don't understand where you are coming from here. Eating meat is ingrained in us as humans and the raising of animals for us to eat is in many ways a necessary evil, but why do you want to make that evil worse than it already is? Why should we double down on how shitty we are to other conscious creatures who feel pain much like we do. Certainly we could still be provided with food without having to torture something first. And as to your point of saying that they would kill us first, I think that is maybe the most ridiculous thing you said. It's like your saying, hey they would go with their instinct to kill us if they could, so we should use our rationality that has evolved past instinct to decide to torture them. Not simply kill, torture. That is good payback for what those animals would hypothetically do right? Long story short, an animal isn't evil for killing another animal since they don't have the option for survival or the capacity for human morality. Humans don't have that excuse so payback makes no sense whatsoever. It's like saying that a 2 year old child might scratch you if it had the chance, so you should be allowed to smother them with a pillow. Ok I just understood the last thing you said and you consider people who abuse animals to be weak too, so I am even more confused by all of this. Is it just that you think people are hypocritical? If so, I don't think that being ok with a little bit of pain makes it hypocritical to care about a lot of pain. Like I said earlier, I would rather be killed outright than be tortured AND killed and I think this is a justified desire. I'd strongly rather have neither obviously but there are levels to morality that I think you have ignored. I have little issue with hunting for population control or dogs in Russia, but you talked specifically about animal cruelty laws."

CMV: Veganism is wrong... because of fish.,shark_to_water,1,"Many vegans believe that sentience -- or the capacity to have subjective experiences -- is a sufficient and necessary condition for moral status. Moral status can be understood as a being's having non-derivative ethical importance; their lives matter for their own sake, regardless of their impact on (say) human lives, such that they can be wronged. Whether fish are sentient is a controversial scientific question. See [here](http://animalstudiesrepository.org/animsent/vol1/iss3/1/) (and the large number of responses to the key article in the thread). Some vegans who are aware of this controversy follow a moral precautionary principle in their dealings with fish, for they believe acting in such a way is the only appropriate ethical response to the moral status fish may possess. A precautionary principle like this can be summed up in various ways, but I think it's well captured with the thought """"if you don't know, don't kill."""" The idea is, if the moral status of a being is as contentious as that of fish (for example), it is morally hazardous to ignore the controversy and kill that being anyway, if, that is, you don't have a legitimate moral reason to do so. (Vegans know we can be healthy eating a plant-based diet, so killing fish for food doesn't clearly make for a legitimate reason of this kind.) Going ahead and killing such a being anyway without a legitimate moral reason would be seen as being indifferent to the real possibility you may be seriously wrong, behavior which is by itself morally objectionable (even if it turns out, unbeknownst to you, that the being actually doesn't have moral status to begin with)."

Nobody else's morality or ethics changes that as long as you don't resolve this internal conflict, you'll feel uncomfortable with yourself. Asking others to tell you what you should or shouldn't do won't relieve that conflict. If I were you I would look at your own sense of right and wrong and compare it to your own desire for pleasure and convenience and find the right balance for yourself, not ask other people to tell you what you should and shouldn't do. I went through that struggle when I was a couple years older than you and haven't eaten meat since (that was 1990) and I feel great about my eating habits. Other people go through that struggle, become hunters, and feel great too. Only you have your particular sense of right, wrong, convenience, pleasure, budget, etc, so only you can figure out your behavior. Also only you know how much internal conflict you're comfortable with. In short, what behavior do you think is right for yourself? How much of that behavior are you willing to sacrifice to gain pleasure and convenience and whatever other considerations factor in before your conflict bothers you? When you've answered those questions, you've found what's right for you at the time. As you change your behavior you'll learn, which will lead you to adjust that balance.

CMV: I don't want to be a vegetarian,old_tombombadil,0,"The reason we love meat so much is because for hundreds of thousands of years, meat was a wonderful source of important nutrients for our species. This is really the reason that any animal eats the foods that they eat. They are seeking the nutrients their body requires through any means available to them even if it requires killing another animal. For much of our evolution, killing animals was required for survival and has therefore become an instinct of ours. However, now we can rather easily obtain all of the nutrients to live a healthy life without killing anything that will experience pain when we kill them."

CMV: I don't want to be a vegetarian,indigofox83,0,"Here’s a few reasons I’ve come up with. This is from the perspective of someone who does still eat meat occasionally, but cooks vegetarian most of the time. I am assuming lacto-ovo vegetarian here (eats eggs &amp; dairy). 1. Environment. Meat production needs more water than equivalent plant-based diets. Meat diets produce a lot more carbon. 2. Your health. A plant-based diet lowers your risks of a lot of different health problems, including heart diseases, high blood pressure, diabetes, and many cancers. 3. Cost. In general, a vegetarian diet costs a lot less than a meat-based one. Meat is expensive. 4. Sanitation. Cooking becomes easier with no need to worry about having uncooked meats touching vegetables you're planning to eat raw later. You also eliminate a lot of potential sources of foodbourne illness. (Not all of it, obviously. But some.) 5. Vegetarian food can be completely delicious! I don't know your food tastes, but I'm going to try this anyway. Here’s some things I've made for dinner recently. Potato &amp; Poblano Enchiladas with Salsa Verde. Pear, Goat Cheese, &amp; Arugula Flatbreads. Asparagus &amp; Pea Risotto. Hot &amp; Sour Soup. Stuffed Shells in Roasted Tomato Sauce. Twice-baked Jalapeno Poppers. Corn Cakes with Avocado Salsa &amp; Goat Cheese. Sweet Corn &amp; Green Chili Baked Flautas. None of this was any harder to make than a meat-based counterpart and was easier, in many cases. 6. Building on number 5, you get to be a lot more creative with the food you eat. Meat diets often get people into ruts of """"piece of meat, some starch, side of veggies"""" for their meals. When creating your meals just with vegetables, you end up a lot more likely to try new foods or foods you thought you didn't like. I used to hate both beans and mushrooms, but it just turned out I'd never had them prepared in a way that was interesting to me or didn't eat them because I considered them secondary to the meat. 7. As a counterpoint to 7, you can still be lazy/unhealthy with your food. Eat cheese fries. Pizza. Faux meat hot dog or sandwich (the breaded chicken patties I find are nearly indistinguishable from their meat-containing counterparts, even). Spaghetti. Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese. Oreos (vegan, even!). Peanut butter &amp; jelly. Frozen burritos. Scrambled eggs. The list goes on."

CMV: I don't want to be a vegetarian,silverionmox,0,"There are four main arguments, any of which I consider sufficient as a reason to eat less meat or no meat at all. - Health: especially red meats have been proven as contributing to a wide variety of diseases. Animals also often are carriers or sources of infections that can affect you. Lastly, as the last step of a long production chain, artificial food additions accumulate into meat, and the production process stimulates the addition of a variety of questionable chemicals and hormones that can effect you, as a fellow animal, too. - Efficiency of production: it's much easier to grow plants to eat directly than to feed them to animals to butcher for meat. Much more people can be fed with the same resources if we eat mostly plants. Those freed up resources can serve other purposes. - Ecological burden: less efficiency also means a larger pressure on the environment, as more space has to be dedicated to agriculture than necessary. The farming of animals also stimulates the spread of antibiotics, hormones etc. which turn up in our food and water. Methane emissions from livestock are a key contributor to greenhouse gases. - Animal suffering: factory farming, the source of most meat, is horrible, there are a plenty of youtube videos. Slaughterhouses, inevitable even for free range animals, are worse than holocaust camps for animals. As for your arguments pro, I don't think they're a compelling reason to eat meat or override the concerns against: - Delicious: there are a whole lot of things that are fun, but not good for you. There also are plenty of delicious vegetarian dishes, which you probably will never discover if you don't try them on purpose if your habit is eating meat. - Less effort: you're still going to eat vegetables, so you're just changing the ratios of the food that gets prepared. Volume remains similar. Plants also generally are less prone to spoiling than meat, so you don't need to freeze/refrigerate everything like you need to do with meats. - Price doesn't matter: eventually, it will.

People who consume more animal products are more prone to diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, diabetes, and cancer.

I think that animal rights is stupid. CMV,Astromachine,0,"&gt;The bottom line is that animals are not people, they do not have people feelings, they do not have people emotions. I don’t think you can conclusively make this statement. There is a lot about human emotion which is still theory and not well understood. Also, consider this. Some animals do in fact share what are considered ‘basic’ emotions, fear, happiness, anger etc. It is the complex emotions, such as jealousy, which we’re unsure of. ‘Animal rights’ often seeks to protect animals from the basic emotions such as fear or pain and not the complex ones. The question we have to ask isn’t ‘Do they have emotions’ the question is ‘Can an animal suffer?’ The obvious answer to this is yes. We’ll return to this point to find out why this is important. &gt; Like how Australia spends money on protecting whales. I’m not really sure I would consider this an ‘animal rights’ issue. Protecting species from extinction, especially when the reason is because of human actions, is our responsibility. We have an obligation to our children to take care of the world we are going to leave them and treat it well. This does include its wildlife. When humans drive species to extinction, ecosystems collapse and more wildlife dies. We can’t just trash the planet and rob our children of these wonderful natural treasures. &gt;Every cent that we spend on protecting whales could go towards the saving of a certain human life in Africa Africa is an interesting situation and a different discussion all together. But suffice it to say that you can’t just spend X amount of dollars and expect to save X amount of lives. In fact, sometimes money IS the problem. Either way, most animal rights groups are non-profits or charity organizations and foreign aid comes through the government. So you really can’t compare their budgets. &gt;When animals suffer, that is animal suffering, not human suffering. This is a rather moot point though isn’t it? I mean, your suffering is not my suffering. Her suffering is not his suffering. An African suffering from AIDS is not suffering the same as an Asian with cancer. A dog that is on fire is suffering more than me suffering from a headache but I don’t think the priority would be for me to find some aspirin just because I’m a human. Ok so final bit, and it goes to the WHY is it important to consider animal suffering. Well, simple, we’re human. We have emotions, even complex ones such as empathy for other living things."

Keep in mind that in the grand scheme of things, the distinction between animals and humans are meaningless - humans *are* animals. Now of course, what you're trying to get at is that animalian suffering as applied to humans is the worst kind of suffering, going off the assumption that we consciously perceive suffering. Going back to my previous point, we don't know if other animals (specifically mammals, which once again have the most similar brain structures to us) aren't consciously aware of themselves. Some animals exhibit conscious behavior, but saying that anything that doesn't act like humans doesn't suffer is an argument from ignorance. edit: spelling"

However, they still accept the terms that being a Scottish citizen entails that you are Scottish so they are engaging in a logical inconsistency. The actual fallacy goes something like this: &gt; Person A: """"All Scottish people are tall"""" &gt; &gt; Person B: """"What about Person X? They aren't tall!"""" &gt; &gt; Person A: """"Person X may have been born in Scotland, but he doesn't like potatoes. He's no TRUE Scotsman"""". &gt; &gt; Person B: """"Whether or not he eats potatoes has no barring on whether or not he is Scottish"""" Your example would actually be closer to: &gt; Person A: """"Scottish people are always tall"""". &gt; &gt; Person B: """"What about person X? They aren't tall!"""" &gt; &gt; Person A: """"Person A is Irish not Scottish"""" &gt; &gt; Person B: """"Oh right. Sorry I was misinformed about his nationality."""" A vegan is able to make the claim that what you are advocating for is not within the confines of veganism without engaging in a logical fallacy. This does not mean that a vegan should reject hearing your opinion on the basis that they are vegan, but it is not wrong for them to point out that you are NOT vegan if you choose to eat meat, no matter what the rationalization is."

CMV: Eating venison and some other game meats is consistent with vegan ethics.,srcrackbaby,0,"By your logic, Is it wrong to cull humans that are suffering or dying of starvation? If so, then shouldn't the same ethical principal also apply to animals? I personally believe that killing is wrong because of more than the suffering it causes because of the future of value argument. And that living a life of suffering is a better fate than death. Another consideration, if the goal of hunting was to reduce the amount of suffering in the deer population, then it would make sense to only kill deer that are dying of starvation, and not kill the ones that are healthy and content. Most hunters do not make this distinction, and would in fact prefer to kill a healthier deer because it would result in more meat. And what if the unhealthy, starving deer that was shot by a hunter would have discovered some food in the next 5 minutes that would have brought great pleasure to the deer? Another thing you have to consider is the effect that hunting has on natural selection. Hunting causes deer to be naturally selected based on their ability to avoid humans and guns, rather than their ability to forage for food, which is unnatural to their environment. Hunting also effects the populations of the plants deer eat, as well as the natural predators deer have, which in turn have their own evolutionary consequences. Edit: Just thought I should add that I am a vegetarian because of ethics and morality to give context as to where my arguments are coming from."
CMV: Eating venison and some other game meats is consistent with vegan ethics.,GnosticGnome,0,"&gt;Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products. There is no denying that. But, as a (new) vegan, I believe the key word here is """"product,"""" i.e. an article or substance that is manufactured or refined for sale You can certainly create a new philosophy around this idea of anti-industrialization. Perhaps you can tie it into Daniel Quinn. That's fine. But it's quite different from veganism. Veganism isn't about nature per se (obviously man can be a predator naturally), but about refraining from exploiting animals for food. Vegans don't hunt, they don't kill animals, and they don't even steal their eggs or milk or honey. There's nothing unhealthy about milking a goat, but the goat made that milk for its babies and not for you. There's nothing environmentally unsound about hunting rats or deer, but those rats and deer didn't ask to be eaten. You may find vegans approve of breast milk or placentas if those are freely given, sure. But there's no logical conclusion of veganism that leads to eating animals you """"cull"""". Veganism has nothing to do with whether we should cull animals or not, but it very clearly states that if we do cull them we don't eat their dead bodies afterwards. &gt;The point of veganism is to limit the amount of suffering one brings into the world Not really. It's not that animals suffer when you milk them, it's that you have no right to do so because they can't give any sort of meaningful consent."

"CMV: It's extreme hyprocisy to be a vegan and have an """"on demand"""" lifestyle-dictated abortion",peachiewonder,1,"Hi, I'm vegan and pro-choice here (but pls hear me out anyway!), and I think they are two very separate things. Veganism is about minimising cruelty and harm to living creatures where possible and practical. Abortion is about a woman's choice to decide what happens with her body. See: the expanding baby theory, and the famous violinist theory. Nobody but that woman has the right to decide what happens to her body. Whether or not abortion is ethically 'right' is one question, but I don't see how it links to animal agriculture. Eating animals for fun (which is basically what most of us humans do; we don't need the meat, if we needed it I would be dead by now) therefore we cannot justify (in my mind anyway and I'm not trying to convert anyone by the way!) eating meat. Having an abortion is not a fun thing to do instead of having a baby - it's an unpleasant procedure that's an alternative to an even more unpleasant lifetime of raising a child/finding a family to adopt a child, let alone the 9 months of carrying said child in your stomach and the countless physical, hormonal, and sometimes psychological repercussions of this, both during the pregnancy and ongoing. Sure, the musician had an abortion because she didn't plan on having a child and she didn't have room for it in her life/apartment. But did she get pregnant on purpose? I don't think she did. I think she wanted to not be pregnant, then, despite what she wanted, she found herself pregnant thus an abortion is, in my view, fair enough. I mean, not eating meat or any other product that causes pain and death to animals. I can't justify eating meat/dairy/eggs just because it's tasty. I can justify getting an abortion because I didn't want to be pregnant in the first place and I have no room, no money, no partner to support me in raising a child and no desire to raise that child (so it would not be having a fun time). Plus, we don't know her circumstances completely. She may be on the pill. Her long-term partner may have raped her. She may have been told she was unable to have children, or any number of other circumstances. ALSO one more point: the earth has too many babies.

Other vegans choose their diet because they believe eating animal products is detrimental to health ... and to some extent it's true that the nutritional benefit we gain from eating animal products is offset by some degree of unhealthy side effects, so as long as they have access to a wide range of plant foods, they can create a very healthy diet which is not ''unreasonable'' as you claim."

This is evidenced by the concept you pointed out that veganism is taking it """"a bit too far."""" My question would be, too far from what? Switching the burden of proof around to say """"why is it reasonable to eat meat or animal byproducts?"""" and you will find that it is just as difficult to justify your point under those conditions, as typically the """"it's for protein"""" argument is not really all that good considering all of the problems associated with raising animals (ethics, waste, environmental concerns, etc.) So I would say, unless you can find a valid reason other than """"it's not normal/usual and I think that is wrong"""", stick with your original statement """"I respect people's life choices"""" and call it good.

Cows need to be milked, but in many cases they are given hormones and over milked, live in small spaces, etc. The list is really long for all the shady common practices. A good documentary to watch is Earthlings (it's pretty biased toward veganism in my opinion and I think kind of takes it a little too far and only shows the bad side, but it does show what is happening in some of those farms, but I am skeptical about how common it really is) or Food Inc. I think for many they don't know where the animal products are coming from and how the animals were treated so they avoid it all together. But what I don't understand is if they raise their own chickens or cows, or if they know of a farm that treats them ethically, why would they still avoid it? That I don't really know.

It's quite painful, and the cows have to have be dosed with antibiotics to clear it up. Do a single Google search on the prevalence of mastitis in American dairies and you'll see that the majority of the dairy cows are in infected with it. I could also name a slew of other reasons why the production of milk products could be considered cruel.

True or not, I will answer you from a Swedish point of view. Status quo is not natural but caused and upheld by humans who conciously hamper the equilibrating mechanisms of nature. Our natural predators, wolves in particular (and to a minor extent brown bears) were once commonplace throughout most of the country, before they were hunted to the brink of extinction in the nineteenth century. Since then, the numbers of moose strolling around in our forests have skyrocketed (how convenient for the substantial share of Swedish men who go hunting a week or two a year). Nowadays, predators are not allowed to reproduce freely as we have wild life policies stipulating yearly hunting quotas to keep their numbers """"in balance"""". Wolves feed exclusively of moose. If were a vegan, I would argue that we have created this problem ourselves through our disrespect for wild animals. We can let nature solve it (sure, wild wolves threaten to ruin the business of sheep farmers and cattle owners, but for the most part there are ways for them to handle the threat and continue with their business) but prefer to let hunters do it instead. Similar man-made overpopulations probably exist all over the world. I admit, however, that invasive species constitute a different kind of threat.

Predators, when attacking a herd, only have to catch the slowest or weakest member of the herd. This ensures that the strongest survive and pass their genes. But in the case of human hunting, a lot of this is thrown out the window, because moose evolved to avoid their natural predators. Instead, what is currently being selected for is a moose's ability to hide from humans. But let's say you're right, that moose will overpopulate if humans don't intervene. Okay, then what? Eventually they will eat so much grass that it will run out, and the moose will decline in number as a result (due to lack of food), causing the grass to recover. This is a natural cycle, and in mathematical biology, there are [differential equations that model this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations). Although it's typically used with animal Predator-prey systems, it can also model the interaction between moose and grass. Now let's say your worst fears are realized and the grass goes extinct in the wild. What happens then? Well, the moose will severely decline in number. Meanwhile, it's not like it's difficult to grow wild grass in captivity, so humans can simply wait for the moose to decline in number then reintroduce the grass. And the cycle begins anew. This is a far more efficient method than hunting, as it takes far less effort &amp; resources. But it also removes evolutionary pressure from humans meaning that moose will not evolve to avoid hunters and instead evolve due to natural circumstances. And yes, this is a real thing. Many animals that typically have horns or tusks have genetic mutants that don't grow them. In a world where humans hunt for ivory, this puts a huge evolutionary pressure on these animals to evolve without ivory, meaning that if poaching continues at the current rates, elephants and rhinos may end up evolving to no longer have tusks/horns. Is that what you want? In the case of moose, they may evolve to be smaller to more easily avoid &amp; hide from humans. Is that what you want? For me, as an environmentalist and vegan, I want to preserve these animals so that we can better understand their natural evolutions. But if every animal is evolving to avoid humans, this is (1) going to fundamentally alter their phenotypes, (2) causing the animals to possibly lose other adaptations, meaning we can no longer study their natural traits, (3) resulting in an unpredictable future for the ecosystem as a whole. Also, I don't want the next generation to ask me """"what was it like back when most elephants had tusks? How did they grow and what did they use them for?"""""
CMV: As a vegan I can still support responsible hunting,MrChoovie,0,"1) You have an apriori assumption that moose meat is food, without even realizing it. """"It would be a waste to not eat the meat as well"""" - would it be a waste to not eat the meat of your dead dog? What is the difference? 2) Humanity is suffering from overpopulation too, there's too many of us on this planet. Would you suggest mass killings as a solution too? 3) """"The moose would also run on the roads much more often than now, and that would result in many more car-moose crashes as now"""" - so you're suggesting that moose are nothing more than a nuisance to the drivers and their life is so unimportant that it's better to kill them in advance than to have a risk of damaging cars. 4) So if a sentient living creature is killed instantly, you're saying minimum suffering is caused. But what does it mean? How low is that minimum? Is it very close to """"no suffering"""" or still an extreme amount of suffering? Again, very easy to test that statement for hidden stereotypes: would you apply the same logic to people, or at least dogs or cats? I guess if we think of suffering as purely feeling pain, fear and other negative emotions, then yes, there's no suffering caused in this case. But if we're considering that this sentient creature could've continued to roam around and be free, enjoy their place in the world and be liked (or even loved, who knows if they're capable of that) by other creatures and instead a hunter decided to brutally kill them, cut their corpse into pieces and then eat it (maybe even not finishing their meal and throwing the rest into the trash) - many people consider that extreme suffering. 5) Would you [kill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) an innocent child to save lives of several people?

CMV:Vegetarianism/Veganism are illogical lifestyles,mbevks,0,There are many vegetarians who are vegetarians purely as a matter of taste. They stick to the food they enjoy and that food is a vegetarian diet. So how is eating according to one's taste illogical?
CMV:Vegetarianism/Veganism are illogical lifestyles,funchy,0,"&gt;* There is nothing inherently cruel about raising animals for food Then your idea of cruelty differs from many others. I have to ask: what do you understand about factory farming of livestock? How is it not cruel to lock an animal in a cage or crate so tiny the animal can't even turn around -- for its entire life? &gt; vegetarians do not live longer That contradicts the China study ans research on vegetarian 7th day adventists. Also consider the top causes of death for adults: heart attack, stroke, and cancer. There is a strong correlation between a high meat diet and cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer. &gt;* Eating meat has been an essential part of human evolution for 2.3 million years. so was living in caves. Then we became civilized and lived in large villages, made possible by agriculture. If modern humans were meant to eat meat, why must we cook it first? We don't have the teeth to tear it without cooking (look at a lion or wolf mouth). We don't have the digestive tract to digest uncooked meat well and to stave off disease and parasites from raw meat. &gt;* Eating meat is not cruel or unethical; it is a natural part of the cycle of life. For a lion who must eat meat and who cannot use reason, eating meat is a natural part of life. You however are no lion. You are able able to live a long happy life without *needing* to kill. Humans claim to be superior to animals and we're gifted with the ability to reason and have a conscience. If you agree humans are superior to beasts, you can't ignore the value of life and the need to not kill or cause suffering. Causing animals unnecessary significant suffering is just as wrong as slavery or infanticide or beating wives. It's wrong because you're better than that. &gt;* As omnivores it is natural we eat both meat and plants for food You keep using the word natural. That word means nothing because it can be made to mean anything. &gt;* Meat farming is no more destructive then traditional agriculture Livestock is [a significant producer of greenhouse gas]( http://www.worldwatch.org/agriculture-and-livestock-remain-major-sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions-0) Livestock production is extremely inefficient use of resources. In a world fresh water is becoming scarce and humans don't always have enough to drink, it doesn't make sense to consume meat. A common estimate says it takes [2500 gallons of water to produce one pound of meat]( http://www.vegsource.com/articles/pimentel_water.htm). In a world where humans are still starving to death, the grain tossed into livestock troughs in just America alone [could feed the world]( http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat). &gt;* Everything must be taken in moderation Does that justify anything unnecessary action that causes suffering to others, environmental damage, and may harm ones own health? * There is no logical reason to be a vegan/vegetarian In addition to the many good reasons listed above: - antibiotics needed to produce cheap meat on factory farms is breeding pathogens resistant to antibiotics. Now when you get an infection the $20 bottle of pills may not work any more. You may need to be hospitalized for an iv antibiotic that costs thousands of dollars per treatmebt. - runoff from factory farms put drug resistant strains of pathogens such as e coli into our waterways or on our vegetables. All those steroids, antibiotics, and other drugs end up excreted in urine and feces and washing into waterways to taint our drinking water. - some pathogens passed from meat to humans are not destroyed by cooking, sickening and killing people. Bse (mad cow), a prion disease, is a well known example. - many serious human infectious diseases are a direct result of eating meat, livestock production, livestock markets, etc. Examples include things like small pox. Some experts predict the next big epidemic will be a cross over from meat animals (eg. similar to strains of swine flu, bird flu). factory farms are nothing but huge petri dishes growing future pathogens to wipe us out. - there is a connection between people who abuse animals and who later commit violent crimes toward people. When we teach our kids life has value, it's a contradiction to say """"but it's OK to torture and kill if it makes you money or makes you feel good"""". Animal abuse is illegal not because animals can vote and wrote laws. Animal abuse is wrong because it's very upsetting to society to witness. there's a famous old saying: """"if slaughter houses had glass walls we'd all be vegetarians"""". - economically it doesn't work. In the us meat and dairy are heavily subsidized while non animal foods get minimal if any tax dollars. If people had to [pay what it really cost to produce meat]( http://www.pcrm.org/search/?cid=2586) maybe culturally in wouldn't be so mainstream. ----- &gt;* No, it doesn't take 7lbs of grain to make 1lb of meat Your link didn't seem to work for me. All the studied I've read says meat is extremely inefficient and requires [a lot of grain]( https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=29892). I live in a semi rural area surrounded by farms. I see firsthand the huge amounts of grain going to livestock. There is just no way they can produce meat in such quantity and so cheaply if animals were allowed to eat their natural diet (eg. Grass fed meat, pasted pork). Grain feeding is a must for modern meat production. I see the massive manure tankers spraying what amounts to sewage on open fields, and hopefully not too much will run off into the river where drinking water is pumped or people swim. Livestock production can be thanked for huge fish kills and for tainting wells. Pfisteria causes big kills in my region and it was strongly linked to the run off from the factory chicken farms that exist in a high density around here It's a dirty nasty business. And to convert animals to meat, it creates one of the most dangerous jobs in America : worker on the line of a slaughter house. Those workers also also tend to be low pay and may not get health insurance. It's a horrible way to treat other people"

CMV:Vegetarianism/Veganism are illogical lifestyles,Zeddprime,0,"When talking about morality and ethics, we have to be talking about the experiences of conscious creatures. Morality cannot apply to a rock. Therefore, the greater the depth and breadth of experience a conscious creature can have, the more it's life and suffering matter. A human's conscious experience is so much more important than a chicken's, that you could say the small increase in well being for the human is worth killing the chicken. But because a chicken does have SOME depth and breadth of experience, eventually you can kill enough chickens that killing a single human would have been more ethical (How many? I dunno. A billion?). And if the difference between the benefits of killing the chicken and the available alternatives is small enough, there comes a point where you can't justify it anymore. As a vegan, I think that the time has come that the differences are too small. Firefighters don't eat bacon, because it smells too familiar. So, we can guess that Human is tasty. Human bodies also store all the nutrients a human needs... So, if you knew that a guy was disease free, eating him would be tremendously nutritious and delicious. I call this the Hannibal Lecter diet, and I use it to counter the """"nutritious and delicious"""" argument. Does a creature's depth and breadth of conscious experience not matter as long as they aren't human? Well, some people think that black people are just monkeys touched by the devil to corrupt humanity, and thus mistreating them would simply be animal abuse. This was the whole plot of District 9.

Regarding point (2), it's not clear what the significance of meat-eating being """"a natural part of the cycle of life"""" is supposed to be.

You don't really show any just list things that show that it isn't better than meat eating. If it's no worse then why are you against it? I should address your meat farming is no more destructive point though. Water usage is a huge issue these days. Hopefully we can agree that in many places in the world and America there are water shortages. [Meat farming uses far more water than vegetable farming](http://gracelinks.org/blog/1143/beef-the-king-of-the-big-water-footprints).

This goes into sewage pipes which is causing problems for sewage departments. I'm not going to say this is a reason to be vegetarian but when your list shows that the two diets are equal this is one advantage of vegetarianism. Not a big deal but still should tilt the scale towards vegetarianism being more logical.

Ebola is natural. Bubonic plague is natural. These diseases are likely the result of the domestication of animals for food production. http://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/ Rape has probably been a natural part of evolutionary selection for millions of years as well, but that doesn't make a compelling logical argument that rape is something a person in a modern society would likely condone. ECOLOGIAL IMPACTS You claim: * Meat farming is no more destructive then traditional agriculture This is demonstrably false. Hoofed animals such as pigs and cows destroy the land under which they trod which is why they must be rotated. It's the reason nomadic shepherds have been nomadic forever, because if you leave your sheep in one pasture long enough they eat all the grass and their hoofs destroy the rest of the plant life. In a """"humane"""" method of raising grass fed cattle (primarily so they don't suffer from disease) these animals require vast amounts of land that could likely be put to use for plant based food crops instead. The issue with antibiotics is not the amount of them but their effectiveness - as we use more and more antibiotics on meat, and consume that meat, those antibiotics become less useful for treating dangerous diseases. A huge reason surgery has the success rate today that it never had even 50-100 years ago is because of the wide spread use of antibiotics and sanitation to prevent wound infection. Without the ability to have available, effective antibiotics (remember it's not about quanitity), you would quite likely be served a death sentence by something as simple and currently treatable as a broken arm or a burst appendix. I'd consider removing the ability of the health profession to actually carry out its job and prevent death in humans to be a form of destruction, one that I don't particularly want to see happen. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_meat_production https://woods.stanford.edu/environmental-venture-projects/consequences-increased-global-meat-consumption-global-environment http://science.time.com/2013/12/16/the-triple-whopper-environmental-impact-of-global-meat-production/ ILLOGICAL CLAIMS You say: * No, it doesn't take 7lbs of grain to make 1lb of meat The person cited in this article/link has no scientific or other field related credentials, this is a business article for investors in futures and commodities markets.

They aren't as morally righteous as they claim.,moon9river,0,"I guess that depends on whether you believe animals have souls or a right to live, and if you believe humans should use Earth's life and resources for their own pleasure. I've found, having been raised on bread, meat and dairy and healing my body by leaving from eating those things (slow transition to veganism) that as I move farther away from the mentality that humans are meant to dominate/control/freely use the Earth, animals, resources for our own fun and pleasure, I become happier and feel more connected to people. I often want to bring that viewpoint to my meat-eating friends and while I don't try to tell people what to eat (total shitstorm), meat-eaters often try to tell me what to eat, and I find myself defending myself and being labelled a moralistic pompous ass. 😜 I think the """"lecturing"""" sort of person, meat-eater or vegan, is just a human being seeking to be understood, to avoid judgement or criticism from others. And that's perfectly understandable, because we all do that when faced with someone who doesn't accept us or the decisions we make. I find that the more I care about someone, the more I seek their acceptance and connection with them in mutual understanding. It's quite difficult for someone who has chosen not to be a part of eating animals for taste pleasure to sit at a table with people who are all doing so (I am the only plant diet person in my family). The longer you abstain from eating meat, the more painful it is to watch others do it - because there becomes a heightened awareness and appreciation for an animal's life and being and a sense of connection to that that deepens with time. And it feels really bad when you realize you're the only one in a group that feels that connection. It actually kinda hurts, if you can imagine that, like the animal seen as meat is not seen as an animal but as something whose purpose is to be eaten - a belief I once shared, but now find horrifyingly depressing. Now, it's almost like.. the family dog, who you have had memories with and loved, sitting on a plate looking like meat, and everyone smiling and talking about how delicious he will be, without remembering that that dog once gave them all so much joy and loved all of them so much. So it really is hard to be silent about it. It actually hurts something deep inside to do so. It's really difficult not to want to express the pain of it by telling others what they're doing is, as you see it, wrong. It's clear that to force others to see things your way or to judge them for it is also wrong and divides people into """"sides"""". But people - plant people or vegans or vegetarians or whatever label you want to use - they do it because their experience has led them to believe that eating animals for personal enjoyment is taking life without considering how their decision affects that animal and their connectedness with themselves, animals, and the world. It's difficult to explain that, though. It probably feels like some person trying to preach to about morals. It did for me. I hated that so much - no vegetarian ever gave me the chance to see how I feel because I was always just trying to defend myself from what I thought was moralizing, judgemental talk. But now that I've found my own way there, I see both sides clearly and the sadness of it all. I digress. It sounds like you've done some research on the topic already. You may consider watching Cowspiracy to further your investigation."

My boss has a similar view that you do, he thinks that vegans are """"hypocrites because they aren't 100% cruelty free, no one can be, etc."""" Well that's true, no one can be 100% cruelty free. If I walk in a field I will at some point crush a bug. But how many people will join you in a movement where they must grow all of their own food in their backyard and harvest it by hand with no pesticides and not use cars or walk in the grass or use any products which are mass produce and not take life saving medicine if it were animal tested? No one. No one would join that cause. But millions have become vegan because it's easy and accessible and now the dairy and meat industries are dropping like crazy! The goal is to make a difference, and do what you can. I know a lot of vegans and I've never, ever, once seen someone lecture someone else about moral superiority or any of that. I am vegan because it's the right thing to do. I like animals and do not want them to die. I know that the bigger veganism gets, the more steps will be taken to protect animals in many different ways. Animal testing, harvesting crops, etc. It's not an """"arbitrary line"""" that the evil vegans have come up with. I'm betting you aren't personally down with torture and death. Would you want to throw the switch to gas a room full of homeless dogs? Grind up a bucket full of love, conscious baby chicks? Drag a baby cow from its mother to the veal farm while they both are clearly terrified and upset? Snip the beak off of a conscious chicken? These are all things that are clearly horrible and wrong. Humans are not instinctively cruel, but we are smart and selfish and will convince ourselves that we """"need"""" these products we buy all neatly wrapped on the shelf and that these conditions aren't possibly happening in America and the bits we are eating must have come from a happy family farm where each animal was loved right up until it was humanely slaughtered. That is not the case. Watch the videos, watch Earthlings and tell me that this is an arbitrary line. You are mistaken in thinking that vegans only care about some issues and not others. We care about them all, some are just more publicized and some aren't avoidable. I can avoid eating meat but I can't avoid eating *everything*, on the chance that a mouse was accidentally killed in the process, or because bees are used to pollinate crops. 59 billion animals are killed per year in the animal agriculture industry, that's a staggering amount. Not *nearly* that are killed when harvesting crops. I need to stay alive, but I can do so in the most moral way I can and in doing so, join the movement that's currently crushing the animal product industry!"

People don't realise this because from the outside veganism seems a lot harder than it actually is, and the best way to find out how easy it really is is to try, so I think it's fair to ask people to do so. And I think maximising that ratio is a very good, non-arbitrary place to draw the line. &gt;Millions of animals are killed in order to harvest plant based foods. Rabbits, other rodents, birds, and all kinds of insects get killed in various ways in order to get those veggies to the grocery store for you to eat. Why is this rarely mentioned? Why is it seemingly okay to violate these animal's rights? Why do these animals matter less than other animals? 1. The scientific evidence places heavy doubt on the capacity of insects to suffer, so for them at least it makes some sense to differentiate. 2. This argument only works if you know that your animal products come from animals that weren't fed crops grown specifically for them, which often isn't the case. Even then, it raises new questions about the environment and scalability. 3. There are several articles on the subject refuting claims that more mammals and birds are killed using plant food. 4. The primary problem with animal agriculture is not killing, but the way most animals are treated while they are alive. 5. This is a problem which could probably be solved in the future if people cared enough animals to direct their attention to the issue. For example, it's plausible that harvesters and other machines could be fitted with devices that emit a sound or gas which drives animals away to avoid their deaths."

CMV: Vegan judgment of others on moral (animal suffering) grounds doesn't make sense. They aren't as morally righteous as they claim.,Omnibeneviolent,0,"&gt;Fruitarianism is probably the best practical diet to reduce animal suffering. One would only eat fruits, nuts, and seeds that have or would have fallen naturally from the tree. If done properly, a vegan could reduce animal suffering even more following this diet, a lot more, but they choose not to, likely out of convenience. Correct, but you could then also use that logic to make the argument that someone could kill themselves, thus reducing the amount of suffering one causes, yet they choose not to. The definition of veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, **as far as is possible and practicable**, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose. There's a point of diminishing returns. It's pretty easy to not eat animal products without drastically altering your quality of living or ability to be a functioning member of society. If one wanted to be 100% free of causing any amount of suffering, then it would require a major lifestyle change and possible removal from modern society. Basically, veganism is *the least* one can easily do to reduce the amount of suffering. If someone wants to go further than that, I don't think any vegans are going to object. &gt;One could raise and eat their own insects. This would be healthy, they could kill the insects themselves so as to make sure it's done properly without causing suffering, and it even leaves the option of using insects that eat wood or other non-plant based foods. But again, the vegan just chooses not to do this. Why would they choose to do this, when there are already many other things for them to eat that don't require harming insects? Also, I don't think it's very practicable for everyone in the busy modern developed world to raise and slaughter their own insects. &gt;Vegans have arbitrarily decided where the moral baseline is, when it's okay to violate animal's rights, and what animals may have their rights violated Vegans typically use sentience and the ability to suffer as the baseline as what beings we should or should not inflict suffering on. This seems to be the opposite of arbitrary. What *is* arbitrary is drawing the line between humans and other nonhuman animals. Choosing to disregard the interests of another sentient being simply for having the misfortune of not being born human seems to be a blatantly arbitrary choice. &gt;Millions of animals are killed in order to harvest plant based foods. Rabbits, other rodents, birds, and all kinds of insects get killed in various ways in order to get those veggies to the grocery store for you to eat. It is true that animals do get harmed during the harvesting of crops. However, since it takes far more crops to feed them to animals and then eat the animals than it does to just consume the crops directly, far *fewer* animals are killed in harvesting to feed a typical vegan than to feed a typical non-vegan. Think of it this way: we use animals as incredibly inefficient machines to turn large amounts of food into smaller amounts of food. We grow and harvest crops to feed animals, killing many animals in the process, and the livestock animals end up only converting a tiny percentage of those crops into meat. So when you eat an animal, you are not only contributing to the death of that animal, but also the deaths of all of the animals that died to harvest the crops to feed that animal. [This graph](http://www.animalvisuals.org/projects/data/1mc) provides a great visual representation of this. (Click on """"harvest."""") &gt;Why is this rarely mentioned? It's actually brought up all the time by people who think they have a gotcha argument against veganism. It's also discussed in the vegan community and some (although not many) vegans even go so far as to eat plant foods that harm the fewest animals in the harvesting process. A similar example of this is palm oil, which many vegans avoid due to the harmful nature of how it is currently harvested and produced, which negatively affects many animals. &gt;Why is it seemingly okay to violate these animal's rights? It's not. It's just that it is effectively unavoidable. Imagine what would be involved to make sure that no animal was harmed whatsoever in *any* part of the process? Imagine what would happen to farms that chose to use harvesting and growing methods that could somehow guarantee that zero animals were harmed? It's simply impractical to expect anyone to do this. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. &gt;Why do these animals matter less than other animals? They don't. &gt;If one's goal is simply to reduce animal suffering, all they have to do is forego eating meat one time they normally wouldn't have done so. By passing on that meat, the person has reduced animal suffering. The goal of veganism is not to reduce suffering once, but to reduce suffering as much as is possible and practicable. &gt;If one's goal is to reduce animal suffering as much as possible, then veganism isn't even close to being the best option. The goal of veganism is to reduce suffering as much as possible *and practicable.* Again, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. &gt;If one's goal is to recognize and not violate animal rights, then veganism also doesn't make sense. One can't be a vegan with this standard without creating their own arbitrary exceptions. I don't follow the logic on this. Perhaps you can explain? &gt;TL;DR: Veganism is not a diet that causes no harm, and it is not a diet that causes the least amount of harm.

People who avoid animal-based foods are quite varied in their moral outlooks about their diet choices. Stereotyping vegans is fraught with error. Second, there is no such thing as a morally perfect choice about most things, including what a person chooses to eat. However, if person who is vegan consumes mostly whole, organic plant-based foods they will usually cause less harm to themselves, to the community of all living things that is the environment, and to other people. If 'causing less harm is better than causing more harm' is a moral value you subscribe to, then vegans who consume mostly whole, organic plant-based foods are on morally higher ground than a person who consumes the 'standard American diet.' Third, as for lecturing, part of a human culture seems to be encouraging others to adopt values one holds. This is true for corporations that want to sell products, religions that want others to adopt their beliefs, politicians who want to lead or rule, people who want to help friends. So, while you may be annoyed by an occasional vegan 'lecturing' someone, it seems to me that it is unreasonable to require that vegans refrain from a normal human behavior that most others indulge in. Indeed, are you not lecturing vegans about lecturing? Fourth, it is quite wrong, I suggest, to decry a person who is trying to do better for the sole reason that, in your view, they can't be perfect. The best most people can hope for is to get a little better as they grow older and learn more. Demanding perfection, I suggest, is the worst kind of lecturing, and a specious argument, to boot. Fifth, all living things grow and thrive by consuming or displacing other living things. So it is with humans. The best a person can do is, if they choose, reduce the harmful impact they have on other living things and, if possible, make a positive impact on some of them, all within the constraints of their knowledge, physical limitations, and circumstances. And sixth, if more people avoided animal-based foods and consumed whole, organic plant-based foods most living things, including humans, would realize an improvement in their lives.

So what are the problems with it? Well, it's too loud to carry out any sort of surprise attacks. It has little ability to chase down prey such as a rabbit or even a rat. It has little ability to withstand the elements. And lastly, it needs a pack to be effective. Unfortunately for that little dog, any larger breeds it meets in the wild are as likely to eat it as accept it. What I'm trying to say is that over the centuries we've created breeds of pets that have no real-world survival abilities. At this point, we have no choice but to either care for them or let them die. In other words, the solution doesn't seem much better than maintaining the status quo. Certainly, you can refuse to participate in the status quo here but do it with the understanding that that won't solve the underlying problem. I wouldn't call it slavery, either.

Is a human child a slave just because she relies on and is guided towards good behaviour by her parents?"
CMV:Pet ownership is not compatible with veganism,akadani,0,"Vegetarian of 13 years here/transitioning vegan. I don't eat meat, wear animal products, or use animal-tested products. I also have two lovely dogs. The way you describe pet ownership as slavery comes off a tad dramatic, for example, claiming that humans buy, sell, and discard of pets like they are our property. Well, no, we don't really BUY pets as much as we ADOPT them, like you would a child. You can give away your pet and give them a more suitable home through adoption as well, how is this any different from the human adoption process? You could make the argument that humans abuse there animals, which is in some cases unfortunately true, but is also very true that some parents abuse their human children. Also, when it comes to genital mutilation, many humans in the US are circumcised at birth. Is that slavery too? What I'm trying to say is pets are not treated unlike human children, for the most part. So do you think that parents should not have any decision in their children's home and wellbeing? Should we all just fight for ourselves once we exit the womb? Veg*ans like you and I who quit eating animal products because of the ethics behind it are right in their decision to do that, because we do not approve of the terrible conditions animals have to endure because of the animal industries. But pet owners are also right in their decision to adopt pets, because their motivation is to give these pets a better home and life with a loving family. Both of these life decisions are made with compassion."

Every person is a slave to their government. You have limited rights and you do not have permission to go wherever you would like without facing punishment.

CMV:Pet ownership is not compatible with veganism,Nepene,0,"https://vomadlife.com/blogs/news/why-most-people-go-vegan-2016-survey-results-reveal-all Around 20% of people don't go vegan for ethical reasons. If you think meat eating is great but can't do it because it makes you sick you're not necessarily going to object to pet ownership. Also, many vegans view it as the lesser of two evils. While it's unfortunate that pet ownership carries such a weight of ownership, that's better than animals that have been abused and abandoned starving on the street. A lot of people do buy pets and abandon, what is your moral answer to handle that? In terms of the raw ethics, a lot of vegans are going to have clear answers to your dilemmas. &gt;This also evident by spaying and neutering - the physical mutilation of the animal in question. If it's wrong to cause unnecessary pain and suffering to animals, then it's certainly wrong to castrate them. This is necessary pain, to avoid bringing injured animals into the world. We should also sterilize/ euthanize disabled children, so say some. &gt;For these reasons, human slavery is wrong even if the slaves themselves might be happy - a happy black house slave doesn't justify or exculpate the institution of slavery. People generally don't object to slavery in certain contexts that much, it's very common to imprison people for debt and force them to work. That said, vegans often have more friendly relationships with pets than that of slave owners. &gt;If the human is mentally handicapped and thus has the intelligence and sentience of an adult dog - would it be morally right to treat this human the same way I would any other dog. I would take him to walks, obviously I would castrate him, give him meals from cans, keep him in a human sized kennel, maybe train him to do tricks and put those videos up on youtube etc. http://www.jpe.ox.ac.uk/papers/twenty-questions/ Vegans aren't necessarily doing all of those, although yes, a lot of vegans do support heavy control of disabled people, including euthanasia. &gt;Is this an argument for the destruction of wilderness in general? Do we have a moral obligation to take animals out of the wild into human captivity, where they are cared for the rest of their lives? Do we have at least have a moral obligation to do so in as much we don't affect the stability of the eco system? A lot of animals live in cities because people abandoned them, they're more often the ones people rescue."
CMV:Pet ownership is not compatible with veganism,Karolina1981,0,"I am very much fond of animals. Still, I am a devout omnivore and I absolutely approve of keeping pets AND domestic animals, if only they live in proper conditions. Perhaps canis domesticus and felis domesticus could adjust to living in the wild, but... what is the point? Their lives have been intertwined with ours for thousands of years. The same goes with cows, horses, goats, sheep. To release them would be tantamount to abandonment. Yes, they are mostly slaves to our greedy needs. But are they equal to humans? Nonetheless, I think we should stop domesticating other species, unless some of them have no natural habitat to live in any more (which is quite possible, since deforestation and pollution are destroying vast areas of wilderness every day)."
CMV:Pet ownership is not compatible with veganism,McKoijion,0,"There are many reasons why people become vegan. For example, some do it because they believe it's healthier than alternative diets. Others do it because it's better for the environment. Others want to treat animals with dignity, etc. Your pet ownership as slavery argument only works for some types of veganism. For example, if you are vegan because it is better for the environment, it can make sense to treat animals as commodities. It's like the episode of Futurama with the penguins. Some people are vegan because they believe it is healthier. They don't particularly care about animals, they just want to maximize their own personal health. These people choose to be vegan because of reasons that are compatible with keeping pets. They don't consume any animal products, which makes them vegan by definition. You could argue that they aren't real vegans because they don't use the same logic you do, but that's essentially a No True Scotsman fallacy. Your argument is logical, but you have to accept a dozen premises before you can get to a point where it makes sense. It's like this old joke by Emo Philips: &gt; Once I saw this guy on a bridge about to jump. I said, """"Don't do it!"""" He said, """"Nobody loves me."""" I said, """"God loves you.

CMV:Pet ownership is not compatible with veganism,VoraciousTrees,0,"I would say pets are more like symbiotes rather than slaves. Think about it. The human race in almost complete totality can be found along common, domesticated, 'pet' breeds. We thrive as they thrive. Cats are pest control, dogs have a variety of jobs, and there are many others that were intentionally speciated by humans for certain roles that can really only survive in those roles. It's what they are born and bred to do, and they can really only do it in the presence of humans. There are plenty of examples of animal and insect symbiotic parasites that have not been intentionally speciated as domestic 'pets': crows, rats, pidgeons, roaches, raccoons, etc... Those creatures are not necessarily beneficial to humans and yet are found almost everywhere that human society flourishes just as dogs and cats are.

CMV: Vegans who lecture omnivores about the hypocrisy in getting upset over the dog meat festival are hypocrites themselves.,5-h-,0,"Firstly, I think it's important to note that veganism is about minimizing, not eliminating suffering. You're not required to kill yourself because you can't be perfect, you should just strive to be as good as practicable. In other words, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. having said that, this just seems to be a factual disagreement. Eating plants is more efficient, whether you count small rodents or not. This is because the vast majority of livestock is fed food which was harvested. Figures are available here: http://www.animalvisuals.org/projects/data/1mc You could make the argument from that that a completely free range cow is as efficient in terms of death/calorie as similar vegan food. I'm open to that reasoning (if it's true, I've never really looked into it), but there are a couple of problems with it. One, it's very difficualt to know how your animal was slaughtered (free range is a meaningless label in the US, or so I'm told); two, a large population of cows will always be very environmentally unfriendly; three, it's unsusainable at current levels of consumption due to the amount of land requried; four, it's expensive as fuck."

CMV: Vegans who lecture omnivores about the hypocrisy in getting upset over the dog meat festival are hypocrites themselves.,daman345,0,"&gt;Since this is a binary thing Its not a binary thing. Your whole argument rests upon this idea, but since the vast majority don't consider it a binary thing, they can't be considered hypocrites. A hypocrite is someone who believes something and doesn't practice it, not someone who doesn't practice what someone else thinks they should believe Most vegans believe in reducing their contribution to the suffering of animals by as much as is reasonably practical. Becoming fruitarian is not reasonably practical. A dog meat festival is reasonably practical to avoid. Hence, it is not a hypocritical thing to do. It doesn't matter if you think vegans ought to believe that becoming fruitarian is reasonable, or that rodent and insect deaths are equally unacceptable as farming animals. If they don't believe that, they aren't hypocritical. &gt;Many of the grain/corn harvested foods go towards feeding animals for slaughter -- Yes, but they also go towards feeding you. If you stopped eating grains, corns, etc... they wouldn't need to produce as much of it and less animals would die. Also, this point makes no sense. If the aim is for less animals to die, eating the grain yourself saves far more animal lives than growing much more grain to feed animals to kill and eat.

Either you contribute to the suffering of animals via your dietary choices, or you do not. Vegans feel they have the moral highground because in their ignorance they believe that they don't contribute to the death and suffering of animals. You've asserted that the vegan argument depends on a strict binary between either contributing to animal suffering to any extent or not contributing to animal suffering at all, but you haven't given us any reason to think that vegans are committed to such binary thinking. The vegan doesn't have to say that all animal deaths are exactly as bad as each other; they only have to say that the deaths of dogs in the Yulin festival is no worse than the deaths of chickens, cows, pigs, etc. in factory farms, so it's inconsistent to be outraged by the former but not the latter."

They oppose the unnecessary, human-caused suffering of animals - which is also the claimed basis upon which many omnivores oppose things like the dog meat festival, only many omnivores don't follow that principle consistently (from the vegan perspective), making them hypocrites.

I think animal rights activists are emotional cripples and closet misanthropes-- CMV,TheStratagemAdvances,0,"There was a time, in the distant past, where the virtues of compassion extended only so far as the group you were in. Kindness and empathy were important but only for those in your society. Those other people, those barbarians, meant nothing to you and your kin; their comfort only mattered insomuch that it benefited your clan in some way. In essence, the idea of human rights was virtually non-existent. It's very difficult to imagine a time like this today and that truly is a great thing. As modern theists or secular atheists, we roll our eyes to the trite sayings of the religious texts, of the forced parables that teach other to love our fellow man. """"I don't need a fairy tale to tell me right from wrong,"""" we haughtily proclaim. """"Especially one so simplistic and obvious."""" We forget the era when stepping outside your village or realm meant almost certain death. We forget that these teachings came in a time where a brotherhood of man was less a corny catchphrase and more radical and dangerous way of thinking. We forget the long and hard progress that led through the centuries. We forget because what started at least 4 millenia ago has culminated in a world where the basics of human rights are obvious and the mistreatment of any human is reprehensible and an act that we won't ever stand for, even for our enemies. But morality is ever changing and no one person's view is exactly where it should be. Some our stuck in the past, still secretly wishing tortuous harm upon their enemies, and some our stuck in the future, extending their morality to creatures other than humans just like the prophets and wise men of the past extended the morality of the group to all people. And they, just like those back then, can sometimes sound crazy, weak, misguided, and so removed from the beliefs of others as to seem misanthropic. The rest of us may ignore them, ridicule them, hate them, dare I say it, crucify them but the fact still remains. So long as we advance as a society change will come and it has to start somewhere."

That """"projecting feelings of fear and hurt"""" is **exactly** the same thing **you** do, only you arbitrarily think it is only valid when done to only human animals. Once I grasped the concept of [homology](http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Homology/Definition), the ethical implications followed logically, the ethical foundation then seemed obvious: everything we know about brain evolution tells us – or ought to – that the capacity for suffering is conserved in all vertebrates. So are consciousness, pain, emotion and most of the other supposedly unique human mental faculties whose alleged lack in animals are often cited as justification for exploiting them ruthlessly. Biologist Gerhard Roth is clear on the [evidence](http://books.google.com/books?id=oI2XlPQ5mLUC&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;ots=q9oWWMwcDZ&amp;dq=tetrapod%20brain%20homology&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) for this point (emphasis added) : &gt; All tetrapod vertebrates (amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) have brains that – despite enormous differences in outer appearance, overall size and relative size of major parts of the brain – are very similar in general organization and even in many details (Wullimann 2000). More specifically, all tetrapod brains possess a median, medial and lateral reticular formation inside the medulla oblongata, pons and ventral mesencephalon, including a noradrenergic locus coeruleus, serotonergic raphe nuclei and a medial ascending reticular activating system. There is a corpus striatum, a globus pallidus, a nucleus accumbens, a substantial nigra, a basal forebrain/septum and an amygdala within the ventral telencephalon, a lateral pallium, homologous to the olfactory cortex of mammals, and a medial pallium, homologous to the hippocampal formation (at least Ammon’s horn and subiculum). **This means that all structures required for declarative memory (or its equivalent in animals), emotions, motivation, guidance of voluntary actions and evaluation of actions are present in the tetrapod brain.** These structures essentially have the connectivity and distribution of transmitters, neuromodulators, and neuropeptides in the different groups of tetrapods. That’s all just a fancy-schmancy way of pointing out that humans inherited our capacity for emotion, intellect and consciousness from a long line of pre-human, and even pre-mammalian, ancestors. The discovery of [mirror neurons](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Mirror_neurons) in [birds](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7176/pdf/nature06492.pdf) ought to demonstrate to us that the capacity for empathy was likely present in the common ancestor of reptiles and mammals, and is thus an ancient trait in most modern terrestrial species. The foundational idea of speciesism -- that humans alone possess intelligence/consciousness/empathy/etc. -- is a denial of reality, and ought to be treated by most people like any other such nonsense idea: with conversational intolerance. This is why I am an [animal liberationist](http://baringteeth.noblogs.org/animal-liberation/). Animal Liberation is the radical notion that animals have intrinsic value beyond that which they are given by humans. We reject all forms of exploitation against animals including, but not limited to, the use of animals for food, human entertainment, experimentation and clothing."

"CMV: Veganism lacks a consistent, deep, moral foundation.",Mortress,0,"Vegans are against cruelty and exploitation. They are not against using animal products. If you save the clippings from your dog every time you give them a trim, a vegan would gladly wear the sweater you make out of them. The difference between this sweater and any wool sweater you buy at the store, is that the dog is seen as a companion first, while the sheep who provided the wool is objectified into a little wool factory. This means that the welbeing of the sheep always comes second to profit. Sheep are bred to have a large skin area, resulting into skin folds prone to infection, to combat this pieces of their skin is cut off (mulesing), when they get older they produce less wool and they are sent to slaughter. We could set up rules and heavy monitoring to prevent these kinds of cruelty, but because the farmer profits from what the sheep provides, their relationship is exploitive by definition and the farmer will keep looking for ways to make his business more profitable. But if you would have a healthy sheep as a pet, keep good care of them and make stuff out of their wool, I don't think vegans would have a problem with that, same as with the dog. For eggs and dairy the inherent cruelty is more evident. In both these industries the males are killed right after birth, and the females are killed when they are 'spent'. Cows need to be impregnated yearly. It's heartbreaking to watch [cows get separated from their calfs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkzU7TVtbHc). Chickens are bred to produce 200+ eggs a year, while their ancestor, the red jungle fowl, only laid 20 eggs. Eggs contain a lot of nutrients, so it takes a large toll on the chicken. Therefore, propagating the species is exploitive. In the examples above I used the bare minimum of cruelty inflicted to animals. In real life such happy farms are really hard to find. 98% of the animal products you find at the super market come from factory farms. It's often easier to cut out animal products completely than to do research into the animal wellfare of all products you buy. &gt; Is it better not to have lived than to have lived a life of contentment and happiness followed by a gruesome end? An unborn being doesn't have a will to live, but a living being does. By bringing them into existence and then taking their life away, you inflict cruelty on them. Imagine we were talking about people. Would it be okay to conceive a child, give them a good life and kill them when they have finished high school? Of course not. They are their own person with a will to live. You're not doing something morally good by conceiving a child. If that was the case, the ethical thing would be for women to be pregnant 100% of the time."
"CMV: Veganism lacks a consistent, deep, moral foundation.",Spursfan14,0,"The values can come from where ever you like really, the arguments in favour of veganism are very often extensions of arguments that we generally accept. For example, we accept that it would be wrong to torture and kill a dog or a cat purely for pleasure. But there's no real distinction between doing that and raising a cow or a pig in factory farming conditions for meat. So we can either accept that it is moral acceptable to torture dogs for fun or we can accept that it is wrong to factory farm animals like cows for meat. A similar level of abuse takes place in several other industries like the dairy and egg industry and so vegans do not consume those either in general. But the primary point is that vegans are against animal cruelty and exploitation, so if there is none then it could in principle be ok to consume that animal product. If you go and speak to people in /r/vegan there are people there who do consume eggs from chickens they raise themselves or from close friends. This is not something that is spoken about all that often by the vegan community and I think they've got several good reasons for that. Firstly, the vast, vast majority of animal products produced and consumed by us do not meet the above standards, these is significant cruelty involved in almost all animal products. It's sensible to prioritise speaking about the 99.9% of cases where there is significant abuse vs the 0.01% where it might be ok for someone to have an egg. Secondly, many vegans are not vegans purely on the grounds of animal cruelty. Many have gone vegan for the environmental impact, and as a result they will tend to argue that it is always wrong to consume, for example, milk from a cow. Thirdly, there's just not enough space or resources for us to produce meat or animal products like milk and eggs in a humane way in such a quantity that everyone who wants to eat them can. The type of locally produced, truly free range type of products could only be enjoyed by the very wealthy. And the issue is that whenever there is significant demand for a product and a real shortage, as there would be in the case where only this type of meat was legal, that there would start to be significant breaches of those laws and that animals would be treated cruelly. It seems more reasonable then to just make animal products illegal. It's also reasonable to think that many common products, like milk for example cannot be produced in anyway without an unacceptable level of cruelty. As for the chicken argument, you seem to be taking a very utilitarian view on this. You could argue that when you go to kill the chickens it would be wrong, because your enjoyment of their meat won't outweigh the pleasure the chicken would've taken in enjoying the rett of its natural life under you care."
"CMV: Veganism lacks a consistent, deep, moral foundation.",Omnibeneviolent,0,"&gt;I think that the only way a fundamental moral system of veganism can work is if you naively apply human values to animals Why would this be naive? Do we not share some values with nonhuman animals? Do human and nonhuman animals both value a life free of unnecessary suffering? &gt;an animal needs freedom only as much as it needs freedom of speech, sustenance and happiness are far more important. This seems like a bit of a strawman argument, as I've never heard vegans argue that sustenance and happiness are not important. Obviously there are some rights that would not apply to animals -- i.e. the right to vote. However, there are some rights that are easy to apply to animals, like the right for the innocent to not endure suffering at the hands of another, and the right not to be tortured and killed simply so a human can have a few moments of pleasure from eating its flesh. Giving all nonhuman animals the same level of freedom as humans is not an argument that most vegans would make. &gt;From what I've seen most vegans believe so strongly in the moral reasons for avoiding animal produce that they illogically extend this to arguing there are no advantages to using it at all, either morally or practically, Oh there are plenty of practical advantages to using animals, just not necessarily for the animals being used. It is undeniable that some practices that involved animal suffering in the past has led to greater benefits to the human species. The argument could even be made that even many nonhuman animals in the care of humans have benefited from other animal suffering. In the area of animal-testing, it is the hope of many vegans that humankind will develop technologies and methods that reduce or eliminate the need to use actual animals. Sure, using animals has its advantages, but is harming another being justified simply because it results in advantages? This is a point of disagreement among many vegans. Case in point: The process of growing lab-grown meat currently involves taking cells from live animals, and the process of refining the process and getting the product ready for market may involve the suffering of many more animals. However, one cannot deny that a shift to consuming lab-grown meat would ultimately result in less suffering than consuming meat from animals raised in factory farms, which is why many vegans support this endeavor. &gt;Someone who has milked a cow or keeps chickens can understand a vegetarian or a campaigner for factory farming reform, but vegans are almost an alien species. This is true for nearly any social justice issue. Many people understood eliminating slavery in the US but were against the idea of complete equality. Even today, many people understand that homosexuality should not be illegal, but do not agree with marriage equality."
"CMV: Veganism lacks a consistent, deep, moral foundation.",Chronic_Apathy1,1,"*Many* vegetarians and vegans will make the argument that ethically-raised produce is acceptable to eat. The problem is that, for many people, access to it is an issue, and there's no reliable way to consistently have access to it, so it's better to play it safe and cut it out of their diet entirely, for the sake of consistency. You have a really negative attitude towards vegans though, and you use the word """"naive"""" many times, and refer to them as """"cult-like"""". Did a group of vegans piss on your grandmother's grave or something?"
"CMV: Veganism lacks a consistent, deep, moral foundation.",PotLobster,0,"I'm not sure what the moral foundation of veganism is. But the moral foundation of fascism is that might is right, and the powerful have the right to utilize their power. By using animal products, we justify stealing an animal's property on the basis that we are more powerful."
"CMV: Veganism lacks a consistent, deep, moral foundation.",Zeddprime,0,"There is no Pope for vegans. Veganism is a description of an end result: not eating animal products. Nothing in the definition defines the why. Most vegans are building a house on the sand, so it's easy to see how most people would come away with that impression of all vegans, but there are a few who aim for moral bedrock. I think it comes down to pragmatism. In Star Trek you can have a delicious steak dinner without killing anything, and if you wanted to make killing part of the equation you'd have to go out of your way. It'd be seen as cruel and unusual. If you have to kill for pragmatic reasons, you don't beat yourself up for it. But the bigger the mind on the animal in question, the more of a moral price you pay for giving it pain, confinement and death, and the more pragmatic benefits you'd need to offset that price. An argument is that first world countries have good enough alternatives that the prices outweigh the benefits essentially always. Another argument is that having a symbiotic relationship with the animals in question would vastly offset those prices, but if you don't do it yourself, verification is hard, and it's easier to just not try."
"CMV: Veganism lacks a consistent, deep, moral foundation.",KerSan,0,"&gt;I think that the only way a fundamental moral system of veganism can work is if you naively apply human values to animals and enforce them at the expense of things that animals would care about, but an animal needs freedom only as much as it needs freedom of speech, sustenance and happiness are far more important. This opinion is possible to hold only if you ignore everything that professional ethicists have said on the subject. Please do some cursory Googling of Peter Singer, Tom Regan, Christine Korsgaard, or at *very least* [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HAMk_ZYO7g). &gt; From what I've seen most vegans believe so strongly in the moral reasons for avoiding animal produce that they illogically extend this to arguing there are no advantages to using it at all, either morally or practically, and that they spout their beliefs with the fervor of a cult that's under attack from all sides (and ideologically I guess they are). Ad hominem fallacy. An unusually clear-cut example of it, too. &gt; This turns a lot of ordinary people off veganism as they picture vegans as wool-hating city dwellers whose special dietary requirements are part hobby and part religion, but ultimately naive and ill-conceived. Someone who has milked a cow or keeps chickens can understand a vegetarian or a campaigner for factory farming reform, but vegans are almost an alien species. Feelings are not relevant if you are seeking a rational world-view. I cannot begin to address the issues with your view if you cannot give rational reasons for holding it. &gt; So, I guess that I must be missing something obvious and important, I mustn't really understand the core of the issue and I invite you to change my view. The core of the issue is this. Do you think it's OK to torture animals for pleasure? If yes, then you've got most of the human population disagreeing with you. If no, then you need to give a good reason *why*. One example of a great reason to think torturing animals for pleasure is wrong is to recognize that animals, like people, have inalienable natural rights. Animals don't necessarily have exactly the same rights as humans, but they have some. But if they have the right not to be subject to bodily harm for reasons of pleasure, then how can you justify killing a pig because bacon? As far as I can tell, *you can't*. &gt; Here's what I'm really looking for: What's a good starting point, a set of moral axioms that makes keeping sheep on a hill for wool unethical? Honestly? Pick a set of axioms. No matter which set of axioms you pick, I'll be able to give you either a good reason to become vegan or a good reason to become a serial rapist. I'm hoping you're not going to opt for the latter. &gt; Why shouldn't I keep my own chickens if I treat them properly and care for them, is it better for them not to have existed at all? Who's the """"them"""" in that sentence? &gt; Is it better not to have lived than to have lived a life of contentment and happiness followed by a gruesome end? Wrong question. The right question: is it OK to murder someone for your pleasure?"
"CMV: Veganism lacks a consistent, deep, moral foundation.",Nepene,1,"Well, for a start, most animals obviously aren't kept in an especially ethical manner. Even 'free range' animals often aren't allowed to roam freely. It's a lot of work ensuring that all of your food is cruelty free. If you strongly value avoiding sentient beings being in pain, a clear moral, then on a practical sense it makes sense avoiding animal goods. It's very hard to ensure all of your animal goods are good. The animals on your farm, they're probably killed young too. Few want old stringy meat, so they're likely killed while young with a bolt gun to the head in a place that stinks of blood, a very terrifying and unpleasant experience for them. Vegans do have a lot more respect, generally, for meat eats who only eat meat slaughtered in a more humane fashion."

I don't like most vegans CMV.,ushitomo,0,"The reason you associate veganism (or Prius-driving or bicycling, etc) with preachiness is a matter of selection bias. You notice the minority who are vocal and don't notice the majority who are not vocal.

Up until that point, they never counted me as a vegan, and there are plenty of people I know who don't count me as a vegan, so even though they've met a vegan who does not meet your stereotype, they don't make the association between my behavior and veganism. That selection bias is probably 90% of why that stereotype exists. There's also another phenomenon at play that others have touched on: Upon finding out that I'm vegan, a minority of people will become aggressive with me and challenge my decision to be vegan (ironically much in the same way that you claim in your stereotype about vegans). I have personally learned a few ways to defuse this situation, but it is very easy to get defensive and start countering this attack. In most cases the aggressor will then decide that the vegan is the one who is being aggressive and preachy, even when they were ones who instigated the argument in the first place."

And there are both strong correlations between, on the one hand, a vegetarian diet and reduced risk of cancer in general and, on the other, between regular consumption of red meat and increased risk of colon cancer in particular. It is perfectly rational for an individual to decide that they value the reduced risks of certain diseases that comes from not eating meat more than they value the convenience (or even enjoyment) of eating meat.

I think choosing to be vegetarian or vegan solely for health reasons is not very rational. CMV.,blackeye453,0,"Here's how I see it. Given a biological view of things, homo sapiens evolved to eat other forms of food other than meat. Neanderthals had to eat about 5000 calories/day, mostly in the form of meat. Many of the sugars they would receive were from the glycogen stores of the animals they ate. The overall result was an inefficient for of diet. When homo sapiens came around, they were able to out compete Neanderthals for food, both meat and veggies, etc. Our intestines could digest these new forms of foods. Our guts were longer (small intesting, large intestine) so as we had a greater time to pull the nutrients out of these new foods. People tend to think we evolved and rose to the top of the food chain because we eat meat, but that's a common misconception. We rose to the top and out-competed our rivals BECAUSE of our abilities to eat new foods and be able to do without meat. When I couple historical and evolutionary fact with scientific data that where there are meat diets (in the West) there tends to be more heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure, etc. and where there is a prevalence of plant based diets (in the East) there are much fewer instances of these maladies, I tend to see a good argument for vegetarian diets. In the end, some meat is okay, in my mind. Maybe a couple/few times a month. I may not be able to sway those who are adamant on meat, but I can make an argument for the benefits of nearly getting rid of it from the diet."

I think choosing to be vegetarian or vegan solely for health reasons is not very rational. CMV.,[deleted],0,"In the interest of full disclosure, I am not a vegetarian because my diet would become far too restrictive if I cut out meat along with everything else I have had to cut out due to a chronic GI problem. There is arguably no such thing as food that is 100% healthy. Nearly all foods have some negative effects. For a food to be healthy, the positive effects must outweigh the negative effects. For some foods, the discrepancy between the positives and negatives is so wide that the food can be considered almost ubiquitously healthy (such as apples) or unhealthy (such as Twinkies). For other foods, it can vary person to person. For example, for an athlete, regular spaghetti is healthy because it gives them energy in the form of carbohydrates for their next workout. Meanwhile, for someone with celiac disease, regular spaghetti is unhealthy because the gluten in it will cause their immune systems to attack their intestine. Nearly all of the elements of food, such as carbohydrates and lipids, are necessary for one's health. Too much or too little of anything is bad. Meat has a few big """"problems"""" with it that may be negligible for some folks but unhealthy for others. Meat contains mostly saturated fats, or lipids that are solid at room temperature. These lipids contain much more energy (due to there being more hydrogens on the molecule) than unsaturated fats. This is fine if you use up that energy. If you do not, however, this can lead to weight gain. Additionally, meats tend to be higher in LDLs, the cholesterol that is deposited in your arteries. Again, if your levels are fine, this won't really affect you. Additionally, meat can also contain antibiotics, hormones and other contaminants. This heads more into ethical territory though. The biggest problems with a meat-free diet is failure to substitute other foods for meat in order to get enough iron, protein and other nutrients. If you cannot, for some reason, have soy (I'm intolerant), then you're in trouble. Beans can make up for some of the nutrients, as can some fortified tofus. I'm not that knowledgeable about the dietary options for vegetarians, though I do know that they exist. If you can cut out meat and still obtain the nutrients you need from it from other foods, then you may end up with lower cholesterol levels and fat loss, which can be tremendously beneficial. Obviously, cutting out meat will not make one's diet automatically healthier. In fact, if you do not somehow work the missing nutrients into your new diet, it could be decidedly unhealthy. However, when included with other dietary changes, a vegetarian diet may be healthier for some people."
I think choosing to be vegetarian or vegan solely for health reasons is not very rational. CMV.,EstoAm,0,"Meat is very healthy, many scientific studies have looked into weather or not our ability to eat relatively large amounts of meat (especially cooked meat) compared to other primates contributed to the growth of our brains. However, it is extremely unlikely that our bodies were designed to eat the amount of meat that we can eat today. I think you could take this very similarly to sweets. Certainly our cake, dougnuts, candy ect. etc. are not innately bad for you. Otherwise why would we crave the so much. However our bodies are designed to live in a world where things that are that sweet are scarce. So eating them to excess is bad for us. Meat is also a healthy part of our diet, however again, in the world we live in today it is easy to eat meat and only meat, and this is also not very healthy for us. All of the research into the diets of our ancient and even not very ancient relatives has shown a diet where meat is a small portion of our caloric intake. Now lets say you are a person who is overweight and addictied to unhealthy foods like cake. In order to reduce the temptation you might cut those sweets completely out of you diet, becuase you know that once you start you cant stop. Im not saying being a vegetarian is the same, but I would say that if you want to recude the amount of meat in your diet, it is probably easier to cut it out all together rather than to start counting how much meat you eat relative to how much other stuff.

I think choosing to be vegetarian or vegan solely for health reasons is not very rational. CMV.,shinkouhyou,0,"Almost any restriction you put on your food intake will lead to you consuming fewer overall calories and losing more weight than if you eat a totally unrestricted diet. The restriction can be completely arbitrary, like only eating food that's yellow, or only eating food that's organic or locally produced, or only eating foods that start with letters A-G of the alphabet, or only eating food that's kosher, or only eating Indian food. It doesn't matter. You're putting some kind of limit on an unrestricted diet. You're thinking before you eat. You're reading labels. You might even start cooking for yourself so you can have a greater variety of foods that meet your restrictions. And a vegetarian/vegan diet is *generally* a bit lower in calories and a lot higher in vegetables and fruits than an unrestricted diet. Obviously it's possible to be a vegan and eat nothing but potato chips and candy and empty carbohydrates, but most vegetarians/vegans do consume more fruits and vegetables than the average meat eater, simply because they're seeking non-meat variety in their diets. Most vegetarians/vegans do *not* practice the extreme caloric restriction that offers maximum health benefits. But even a small reduction in the number of daily calories consumed can add up to steady weight loss over time, and the nutrients from fruits and vegetables have all kinds of health benefits. Vegetarians/vegans are also avoiding the potential carcinogens produced by cooking, smoking and chemically curing meats. However, there are other sources of carcinogens that vegetarians/vegans still face, so it's unclear if there's a significant benefit. Studies showing links between high meat consumption and cancer are pretty fuzzy (it's hard to point to just one factor in a person's lifestyle and say """"that caused their cancer!!"""") but it's certainly *possible.* Of course, none of this means that a meat eater can't eat a very healthy diet! It's just that vegetarianism/veganism is a relatively easy-to-follow restrictive diet with plenty of available food options. It's really not that hard to follow a vegetarian/vegan diet as long as money and time are not issues, and you can find foods that you like to eat. Fresh produce and specialty vegan products *are* usually more expensive than non-vegan processed foods, and the extra time needed to find and prepare these products can be an even bigger hurdle. And of course strict vegetarian/vegan diets simply don't fit with many people's personal or cultural food preferences. But other than that, being a vegetarian isn't *hard.* And it's probably a lot easier and cheaper than following a meat-heavy restricted diet like the paleo or Atkins diets. Although this isn't really a discussion about the morality of vegetarianism/veganism (I personally am a carnivore!), those ethical considerations can be a very powerful motivator for sticking to a restricted diet. Are you more likely to avoid that slice of chocolate cake because it has 1000 calories and 30 grams of sugar (a rational reason), or because the eggs were produced in a factory farm where chickens suffered (an ethical/emotional reason)? Many people will find the ethical reason to be a much stronger motivator, and they'll build healthy eating habits that have both a rational and an emotional basis. It's all about finding a system that works for you."

I don't think that veganism, as a lifestyle or belief, is any more inherently arrogant than other belief system that restricts or guides our diet or our principles. I wouldn't want all atheists to be demonized because of the loudest and most arrogant members. Rather than condemning a whole group based on the actions of a few, I think it's more wise to judge individuals by their actions. The issue with militant vegans isn't their veganism, it's the way in which they impose their views on others. Condemning that behavior is both more accurate as to the source of the issue."

CMV:Any vegan who is morally against eating any form of eggs cannot in good conscience dine at a restaurant that isn't exclusively vegan.,llieaay,0,"I think you are still misunderstanding why vegans don't eat eggs.

As a vegan, I do always prefer to patronize the more vegan business. I'd much rather get my veggies from a plant only farmer than one who also farms chickens. But I don't always have the luxury to shop at wholly vegan businesses. In many cases it's hard to know where my tomatoes are coming from, and also I often need to get things from a grocery store. So, I stick to only buying products whose production does not involve animal mistreatment or death. Even if the producers produce other products that do cause harm and death. I am still removing demand towards the humane products. As more people make the decision to buy plants instead of eggs, the profitability of eggs will shift and the hope is that vegan businesses will grow and non vegan businesses will shift towards vegan alternatives.

By observation of their behaviour and examination of their brains, it is reasonable to assume that they experience not only pain but also fear and joy; that relationships can grow between them or even with us humans. These are the things that make people **compassionate** about animals. There are various reasons of why we as a society despise killing humans. While some are of a purely selfish nature (I don't kill you, so you don't kill me!), the most important ones are build on our evolutionary mechanism of compassion. So while it is not necessary, it is at least understandable that some people expand this rule to animals, and the reasons for that do not apply to plants in the same way - most people are way less compassionate about plants for the reason explained above. You are right to question things like this, and you should surely defend yourself if a vegetarian calls you immoral. But your argument was wrong, and you should probably apologize.

How do you know that there aren't foods out there that you are missing out on? For example, [BBQ seitan](http://i.imgur.com/usV6N8Z.jpg). How do you know that you won't be happier and enjoy life more? At the risk of sounding """"spiritual"""", how do you know that you won't develop the empathy you seem to be missing, and find a deeper purpose in life? A lot of vegans say that it's the best decision they've ever made, yet you are letting something like taste and convenience get in the way of exploring it as an option. Can you really take that chance?"

CMV:I'm never going to turn vegan(different to the normal arguments),TheMrShadySlim,0,"You appear to look at life from an egoism perspective (aka what helps one's self interest is what is moral, since everyone doing what is in their own self interest will lead to a happier world), so I will try to give reasons based off of this philosophy. Yes, moral Veganism tends to revolve around empathy, however even a purely selfish person can find some benefits. As a disclaimer I am vegetarian, not vegan however. 1. It give you pleasure that you are doing a """"good"""" deed. Assuming you find that veganism in general is a more ethical thing than eating meat, you can get an ego-boost from being more ethical than your peers. (I know this perpetuates the meme that all vegans are holier than thou, but this honestly applies to many things like charity, fitness, being well informed etc.) 2. It can build better self discipline. Going vegan is a restrictive diet. By being able to hold this diet for a long period of time means you over came many temptations. By building this self discipline you can make your life more productive. 3. Embracing change can be benefical for your life. Life can feel stagnant at times and trying new lifestyle choices can really change your perspective on reality. Going vegan would be a life changer and even if you dont stick with you have a new perspective and can now use that expirience later on in life whether you continue being vegan or just appriciate that steak a whole more. 4. You could reduce the choices you have when eating out and fix the paradox of choice(basically having more choices in life can make you actually more unhappy http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice) 5. It can be cheaper. Meat is expensive, espeically good meat. If you know how to cook and dont but meat subsititues, you can save a lot of money being vegan. 6. Your shits will be so much better. Meat heavy diets tend to not have a lot of fiber, and people are alway constipated. If you eat a vegan diet you can have a lot of fiber that you may normally not comsume. This will make your shits come out nice and clean 7. You are more likely to try a larger variety of food. Since your choices when going out are more restricted you tend to be more creative with the food you do have available to eat. This will lead to you trying new recipes and new foods. You may find something you love (like tofu for me) that you would keep on eating even if you go back to meat eating. 8. Helping the enviroment will help the lives of your kids if you have any. This one may be a weaker argument, but for many people kids are their everything. While you may die the enviroment goes to shit, your kids will suffer through that. Do you really want your kids to have a shit life partly because of your lifestyle? Would you not feel better knowing you at least helped as much as you can in making their lives better? Those are just some I can think of on the top of my head."

And some vegans are different from other vegans. For instance, my friend is lactose intolerant and the smell of meat makes her sick. Since her childhood she was chronically puking from eating different stuff and had a massive problem with how what she ate affected her mood. She is now a vegetarian and is much better because of it. My ex is a vegan. She has her own garden and a large portion of her vegetables come from there anything from peppers, corn, pumpkins, blueberries, squash to tomatoes. Her garden isn't big enough and she doesn't have the resources to use it year round or feed herself solely from her garden. I don't describe myself as vegan or vegetarian but I eat vegan/vegetarian meals at least three times a week. You throw such a huge accusation on a large group of people that are vastly different and so none of it can truly stick. Maybe if you focused on the actual aspect of what being a vegetarian/vegan is your claim would hold water but you're targeting their beliefs/morals which is different from person to person. And I promise you the people who worry *that* much about factory farming are paying attention to where their food comes from. My vegan ex does not buy clothes from a majority of companies because of their ethics. So in short, you can't make such a bold claim on such a large group that doesn't even target the core of their belief. It just doesn't stick. It's similar to when people attribute traits to entire racial groups or different religious demographics. It's nonsense."

Especially when the entire life of a member of that species involves constant pain, discomfort, stress, and psychosis, all ending with an extremely violent death. Is it better that a dairy cow not be born than be born in an industry where she's beaten, branded, dehorned, has her male calves taken away from her and brutalized then slaughtered to make veal, made to stand on concrete in cramped shed with no medical care, made constantly pregnant so she makes milk until her utters bleed, and then brutally slaughtered?"

Despite this however none of these are species and thus it doesn't matter if they go extinct. The original forms of many domestic livestock still exist in the wild and are doing perfectly well without intervention, indeed in many places if they were more in number they would help with certain environmental problems. Looking at this from another angle many large herbivorous species across the old and new worlds were hunted to extinction as a result of humanity. Now obviously this was in a time when vegetarianism wasn't possible however their are analogous examples in modern times with the bushmeat trade.

"CMV: Vegans should use the time, effort, and money they spend helping animals to instead help humans.",McKoijion,0,"1. It doesn't cost money to not eat something. Vegan foods are significantly cheaper and easier to cook than meat based foods. (Rice and beans, spaghetti and tomato sauce, veggie stir fries, etc.) 2. Veganism is arguably the most environmentally friendly thing you can do, and climate change is the single greatest threat to humanity in the long term. 3. Veganism doesn't take up that much time or effort. There is a little bit of learning upfront, but it becomes very easy afterwards. It's much harder for an obese person to lose weight than it is for a fit person to maintain it. 4. Empathy isn't a limited resource. A person can care for both animals and humans without running out of compassion. 5. It's much easier to make an impact with regards to animals than it is for humans. To help an animal, the standard is so low that all you have to do is not kill them to be considered a pro-animal rights person. For humans, it's much harder. Not only can you not actively hurt someone, you actually have to go beyond ignoring them and actually do something to help them. In this way, 1 person can save 10 animals in a day, but 10 people working together might only be able to save one homeless, disabled, poor, or displaced person in a day. I agree humans are more important than animals, but if you look at a cost-benefit ratio, helping animals is also valuable in addition to helping humans. 6. Finally, helping animals would also help more humans in the long run. The biggest problem with meat is that you have to grow grains to feed the animals and then you have to kill the animals. If you just fed the humans the grains directly, you could feed 10 times as many people. (I didn't make that number up. [It's a biological fact.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_pyramid#/media/File:Ecological_Pyramid.svg)) Furthermore, meat is actually relatively bad for humans. It is high in fat and cholesterol, causes cancer, and leads to obesity. Humans evolved to rarely eat meat, and subsist largely on plants. Now that modern technology has made meat dirt cheap, people are eating it at every meal instead of 2-3 times per week at most."

And frankly, there's people out there who like animals more than they like most other people. Who are you to tell them that they should care more about people when they really truly do care more about animals? So long as they aren't actively harming other people, and they aren't, who are you to tell them what to do? They're still way better than lots of other people."

Cutting it saves them money. 2. We don't generally evaluate people for if everything they do is the most important thing in the world, or even the best one. Do you go jogging? Certainly you could spend that time helping poor children. The point is, doing one thing that is good for the world should not be evaluated because it isn't the best. You don't do that for yourself or probably for any other topic. Why single out vegans?"
"CMV: Vegans should use the time, effort, and money they spend helping animals to instead help humans.",Valanarch,0,"I'm a vegetarian, not a vegan, but it honestly doesn't take much time to avoid eating meat. It even often saves time by eliminating options on menus."
"CMV: Vegans should use the time, effort, and money they spend helping animals to instead help humans.",Throwawayace67894,0,Excluding animal products from our lives already helps the environment and global warming which is an issue that effects humans. It's arguable that vegans already are doing good for humans since meat eaters get the world benefits of veganism without any sacrifice or thought.
"CMV: Vegans should use the time, effort, and money they spend helping animals to instead help humans.",ShittyShittyNameName,0,I'm a little confused. Are you under the impression that convincing people to eat less meat ISN'T helping humans? Because people who limit meat (especially processed meat) consumption and increase their consumption of plant foods statistically improve their health (i.e. lower their risk of heart disease and cancer) and help the environment (it takes more food resources to produce meat than it does to produce plant based foods).

"CMV: Vegans should use the time, effort, and money they spend helping animals to instead help humans.",JohnMarstonRockstar,0,"Okay. While I'm no fan of veganism, your argument against it is poor. You're basically saying that people shouldn't put effort into things because there is always something else more worthy of their effort. I don't think veganism has a significantly positive impact on the world, but it is not a valid criticism to go ahead and say that there are better things to put effort into. Firstly, you're placing your own value judgement onto someone else's choices. You might believe that helping the homeless is more valuable than living without consuming animal products. But to a vegan, they may not hold that same judgement. Secondly, perhaps vegans also want to solve other issues, and veganism is one facet of their activism. A vegan may also fight for human rights in Middle Eastern countries, or sheltering the homeless. They are not mutually exclusive. Basically, people have different passions and values, it's not right to assume everyone holds your beliefs. It's also a shaky argument because the world is filled with crises and problems. Putting effort into one problem will likely meaning ignoring several others. If you think veganism is less valuable then other projects, make your CMV argument about that. But don't base your argument on the *assumption* that it is."
"CMV: Vegans should use the time, effort, and money they spend helping animals to instead help humans.",PointNShooty,0,"&gt;There's no shortage of homeless, disabled, poor, displaced, or sick humans who need every bit of help they can get. You're absolutely right. So why should we spend energy going after Comcast when there's homeless that need homes? Why should we create phone apps that make our life more convenient when there's starving children in Africa? Why should we fix potholes when Aleppo is in shambles? Why should people tutor children in America when there's millions of children who don't get any primary education at all? The problem with the whole """"those problems aren't as important as these problems"""" is that you're discouraging people from fixing any problems at all. You're acting like vegans are spending energy saving chickens *instead* of saving humans. But they'd probably take that extra energy and time and write pointless posts on reddit instead."
"CMV: Vegans should use the time, effort, and money they spend helping animals to instead help humans.",landoindisguise,0,"I think the idea that people are necessarily vegan only to save animals is mistaken. There are good reasons not to eat meat that have nothing to do with animal welfare. Factory farming is horrific for the environment, and cattle in particular are contributing a ton to climate change. Honestly I think giving up beef is the single easiest thing anyone can do to combat climate change, and doing that helps ALL humans. Factory farms and slaughterhouses are also notorious for having awful working conditions, so not supporting them helps cut down on the exploitation of those workers... Even if the next job they find pays just as badly, it's unlikely to be as dangerous. And those are just a couple reasons, there are others. Personally I'm a de facto vegetarian (I will eat meat that was raised in a sustainable way, but I very rarely actually bother to get it as I can cook good things just with veggies). But I don't really care about animal welfare. It's nice, but I see it as less important than human concerns. My reason for almost never eating meat is based purely on the climate impact meat eating has when the meat is coming from the factory farm system."
"CMV: Vegans should use the time, effort, and money they spend helping animals to instead help humans.",necius,0,"I'm going to present my argument within a utilitarian framework, which is not how all vegans see the world. - Suffering is suffering. While I value the lives of humans above non-human animals, it does not follow that I should value the suffering of humans more than non-human animals. What is the morally relevant difference between humans and animals that makes the suffering of humans more important than the suffering of animals? I've not been given a satisfactory response to that question. - Even so, if I decide that the suffering of a human is worth one tenth or even one hundredth of that of a non-human animal, I'm not convinced that the moral calculus would work out in favour of the humans. The suffering that humans experience, at least those that I could realistically expect to help without great cost to myself, is generally significantly lower than that of a non-human animals raised for food. Many of the animals we eat, in particular chickens and pigs, live the majority of their lives in suffering. They experience extreme pain, psychological anguish, hunger and thirst (when they're shipped off tho slaughter), and sheer terror. Tens of billions of animals experience this existence every year. - Now let's go to the other side of the equation. Yes, I spend more time on being vegan, but because I am vegan, I save a significant amount of money I would otherwise spend on food. This is money that I can (and do) spend on charities. I donate monthly to Save the Children and Fred Hollows Foundation, both of which do excellent work to reduce the amount of human suffering in the world. I don't want to say that if I wasn't vegan I wouldn't be able to afford to do this, but it would be harder for sure."
"CMV: Vegans should use the time, effort, and money they spend helping animals to instead help humans.",Nepene,0,"If you get yourself and others to eat one less chicken a day then you're saving 365 lives a year. It's hard to see an easy way to save 365 people a year. Plus, they may or may not value humans more than animals. Edit. Plus, veganism is helpful for humans. Animals tend to be fed on plants, and so much plant matter is lost. More humans can be fed on plant matter than on animal matter."

"CMV: Vegans should use the time, effort, and money they spend helping animals to instead help humans.",DippyTheDinosaur,0,"I am a vegetarian for environmental reasons. (Same logic applies for vegan.) I spend a similar amount of money on food as a omnivore, but my food requires about 1/10th of the land space and energy (I can elaborate if you want me to.) Most of the people in the world are almost completely vegetarian because meat is a luxury. The US and other affluent countries have a massive demand for meat, leading to clearcut rainforests and increased greenhouse gases. So in a way, being vegetarian helps everyone just a little bit. The effect is hard to measure because it isn't as direct as working at a homeless shelter."
