https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,5:03,individuated and they're given names so they're identified in their own right as individuals what the reports tend to do is they use very familiar narrative devices to frame them they're what we call intertextual references so that's when you take one story and apply it to another so that it makes sense so in this case they use the story of Butch and Sundowns from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid the idea of these two kind of felons these two naughty um sort of fancy Heroes On The Run and they apply that to the escaped pigs they call them the Tamworth II again this idea of you know two sort of two two two naughty creatures on the Run um they're also referred to as pigs being babe-like so there's references there to Bay the story babe which was both and NFL and what was really clear is as well is that they were anthropomorphized in the story where the pigs are sent to,6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,6:06,the slaughterhouse there's no age mentioned they're treated as a group remember they're just a herd uh there's no familiar narrative framing at all there's no links to popular Escape stories there's very well it's all very factual and it's very much focused on The Human Experience so there's nothing there to do with the trauma that those pigs would have gone through what they were feeling how how they experience that situation it was totally focused on The Human Experience so what this tells us is that how we tell stories about animals really matters and that's where I want to start so I really want to concentrate on the anthropomorphism aspect of this and a few other sort of components which I think are really really important when we're telling stories about animals so the key things that I'm going to be looking at today are to do with narrative how anthropomorphism is used where we get public engagement and understanding and where I think that stories are able to elicit empathy and,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,7:08,perhaps how they do that but the first question we always need to ask is well what can anthropomorphism actually do and I'm not saying this without any basis because we know that stories shape understanding and there's certainly what we might think of as an anthropomorphic tendency in popular media so everywhere we look we see anthropomorphic stories but what we know from recent studies is there's actually a relationship between anthropomorphism and both empathy and changes in behaviors so we see links between anthropomorphism in stories and pro-environmental behaviors also in increased moral concern for other animals and there are debates out there about whether anthropomorphism can enable people to understand better the experiences of animals and therefore elicit some sort of empathetic connection so there is there is something behind,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,8:12,what I'm going to talk about today there's some there's some studies that have been done and there's much more work that needs to be done but we're finding some very positive evidence for the use of anthropomorphism but the problem is is that when we think about anthropomorphism often we'll think about t types so on one we have been both represented here so on one hand we have the idea that anthropomorphism is Dreadful we need to stay away from it it's a form of what people call Disney vacation this is where we simplify the animals so much that it just becomes a human in animal clothing so they're oversimplified there's no recognition of their species specificity or their individuality they're just little humans wrapped in fur or feathers and then on the other end we have critical anthropomorphism and this is something which is used by certain parts of the scientific Community particularly in anthology and it's used as a method so,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,9:13,anthropomorphism is used but it's combined with very deep understanding and knowledge of species Behavior so we've got the popular form on one cut on one hand with Disney vacation and then we've got if you like the scientific version of it which is critical anthropomorphism on the other hand um and what I want to say is that we need to forget about these two types because what happens is when we think about anthropomorphism we have this horror ah don't want to use it it's really worrying we need to be sort of um we need to stay away from it we won't be treated seriously we'll be accused of not treating animals seriously we're getting rid of their individuality we're not recognizing their species specificity their individuality and so forth and I wanted to get past that now because I think that anthropomorphism can be a key narrative strategy that can be both effective and can engage empathy so I've got um a little kind of wheel here of all the things so forget about the,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,10:18,two types for now I want to think about it in relation to these different factors and I'm only going to go through them very quickly because I'm just going to refer to each of these in the different case studies that I'm going to talk to you about today so just so that I kind of clear on the sort of terms that I'm using I'm just going to go through so I'll just explain what what each of these are and how I'm understanding them um so this is what I think these are all the factors that I think are fact anthropomorphism so the first one is mediation basically when we tell any story it's mediated um it goes through a process so what we think about mediation is basically everything that happens to communicate or circulate content so it's that idea that there's something that happens in between the real subject over on one side and what's received by the viewer um or The Listener at the other end so it's everything that happens in between um it's often a complex set of decisions,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,11:19,and choices if you're making a film or you're making content for social media and so on but every story is mediated okay there's a subject it gets mediated it pops up the other end and it's received by a viewer so the example here that I'm giving you is of you know a lion um there's choices that are being made about how to film him he's on boxes here there's certain lighting they're using certain Technologies and then what we have is the final result so it's what reaches the viewer which is the trademark care of the MGM film studios so mediation everything that happens between the subject which is the lion and between the viewer which is you know me for example looking at that image of the lion everything that goes on in between that is mediation then this genre and I'm going to talk about this quite a bit today I would probably take a guess that if you took a look at the two posters on the left hand side of this screen you'd be able to tell me without even seeing the films even if you don't know the films you'd probably be able to get tell,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,12:27,me take a good cat guess at least at which genre these films are and if I describe them to you instead you know don't look at these posters but what you'll see here is um an image of an orca there's going to be an image of a male figure with their arms stretched up in the air the colors of the image are going to be kind of orangey and blue that might not give you any specific understanding of what it is but then as soon as I show you this there are cues in here that tell us how to read these images and how to understand what the story will be so they're the genre cues and we are very well versed in how to read genre cues in fact more so than we ever realized it's what film marketing relies on so genre is really important because it shapes how we interpret the subject and it sets of expectations about how we should understand the story that we're going to be told about the animal so very important and I'll keep coming,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,13:31,back to this idea of genre narrative and perspective I'll refer to you as well narrative if you've been to one of the animal things sessions before you probably talk quite a bit about narrative so I won't say too much about it except to say it's basically the organization of the elements of a story you can reorganize those elements and you'll produce a different type of narrative and I will talk about how you do that and also we have to think about whose point of view the story is being told from remember the pigs at the beginning is it all from the pig's point of view is it about the pig's experience or is it about The Human Experience and then a fact an emotion and often these two terms are used interchangeably and sometimes I may use them interchangeably today um really a fact is just the visceral feeling or the visceral response that you have to something and then emotion is it goes through the cognitive process we put a name on it and we give it a name and we call it an emotion so a fact,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,14:31,is the visceral response the emotion is the cognitive processing of that response and the name that we give it but a lot of narratives are able to engage us emotionally and that is very important and that's what I'm going to talk about when it comes to Sticky narratives so effect and emotion very key to um this presentation um and shall we get to this idea of an emotional appeal and an emotional engagement for an audience and how they're related to anthropomorphism and then finally I use the word discourse I know other people will use the word framing um this is just very straightforward it's really just about what can and can't be said about a subject it tends to be governed by particular forms of knowledge and authorities and experts and I'll talk a little bit about that as well um today and I've got here some examples for you we've got David Attenborough at the top we've got Walt Disney at the bottom um they will talk about animals in very different ways if we heard David,15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,15:35,Attenborough talking about mice we would think about it happening in one way and if Disney was talking about mice we would think about it you know it will be very very different so it's the type of knowledge that they bring and the type of Authority or expert that they that they are which will frame what can and can't be said about a particular subject and obviously thinking about animals in this case so discourse or framing um very very similar so I want to make this point first every time we communicate human to human communication there is an inevitability that you will anthropomorphize and the reason for that is because when we tell stories we tend to apply agency and purpose and intention and psychological motivation even if we're talking about inanimate objects even if we're talking about the commute the computer that's done this terrible thing to us and is driving us crazy for example we will we will imply some sort of intention and so forth even if they're inanimate objects,16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,16:39,so it's almost inevitable that when we tell a story we will anthropomorphize and I think we need to capitalize on that a little more because there's an inevitability to it so let's harness it and let's use it as a strategy but what you might say can anthropomorphism tell us about animals because there's a problem isn't there remember back to the problem of Disney vacation and so on but I'm going to give you some examples here where animals have actually been what we might class as dignified um and these stories can tell us something so Finding Dory for example that told us that um it gave us a morally relevant message it told us that animals prefer free roaming to being in captivity Happy Feet Again if you like a Disney fired version of uh penguins and penguin life but it told us about the plight of animals due to climate change and then up here which I'll talk about,17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,17:41,today um which is very much dignified and which is a story that delivers a message that animals don't want to die so humans can eat them so we can still deliver a strong message even when we use this kind of process of dysnification even if you like at its most extreme so I want to talk to you today about three stories less stories about anthropomorphism um animals and empathy and um they they sort of get a little bit shorter as they go along so the first one will be a little bit longer than the other two but but they do get a little shorter as I as I kind of go through this presentation so the first story I want to tell you is a story about kangaroos and it's a story about these three kangaroos um in 2016 um an obviously photographer um called Evan schmitzer was um going through his neighbor's property and he saw three kangaroos um um the male kangaroo seemed to be,18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,18:50,holding on to the female kangaroo who had outstretched arms she seemed to be stretch arms you know towards the Joey um and she was dying and so he took pictures of this as it happened and he noticed that the male kangaroo and the Joey stayed by the female's body I wouldn't let any of the other kangaroos come up to her when they stayed with her until she died and Evan posted these images on a local social media site and they were picked up by his local newspaper and the story was then picked up internationally and it was huge certainly in Australia and the UK but elsewhere as well around the world and though it was covered in many many press Outlets many many news outlets and here's just a few examples for you um so there's a few headlines here just to point some out dying kangaroos said goodbye um captured by hervey Bay local,19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,19:54,um heartbreaking moment kangaroo cradles dying mate in his arms as mum reaches for Baby Joey one last time and the one for The Courier you might not quite be able to make it out it says tender Roo this is the incredible moment a morning kangaroo gently crables his dying companion as she took her last breath in front of her Joey at Greenland's Fraser Coast and there was a quote that was used extensively through the papers um from Evan it was eyewitness to this um this event and he said he would lift her up and she wouldn't stand she'd just fall to the ground he'd nudge her stand besides her it was a pretty special thing he was just mourning the loss of his mate and this really captured the attention of the public and it was shared extensively on social media and here's a little snapshot of you from Google Trends so you can see um this is um as sort of gives you a sense here of um the um the pattern in,20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,20:55,terms of what people were searching for at the time and you can see here that the searches for Kangaroo photo grieving kangaroo morning kangaroo there's a huge Spike here as people were searching for um for the story and for the image um over the the few days when this was being covered by the Press um but no sooner had this been circulating for a couple of days that there's a new set of stories started to emerge and they came on the back of a couple of scientists who came forward and said yeah actually the photos that you've all been looking at this is not something to do with a happy family or you know the uh the female dying this this actually is a story um about a male kangaroo who's probably killed the female whilst he's been trying to mate with her and so I've got the two quotes here again that were used extensively throughout the newspapers um and I'll just very briefly read out the first one great photos for kangaroos but I think they're Thunder like,21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,22:00,fundamentally misinterpreted the mail is clearly highly stressed and agitated his forearms are very wet from him licking himself to cool down he's also sexually aroused the evidence is here sticking out from the scrotum he asked him marsupials the penis is located behind the scrotum this is a male trying to get a female to stand up so he can mate with her and then the other quote from another scientists pointed out that often mating process can be particularly awful um and he he says abusive and the females can actually die in the process and he believed that's actually what had happened here so they they essentially accuse the public of overtly anthropomorphizing and this set of images and they said you are all misinterpreting in their story and here's the real story and this was covered by all the same press Outlets as the um The Grieving kangaroo story so the media framing suddenly changed um and I've given you a few accounts here which came from different uh different um different Publications uh,22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,23:06,National Geographic it appears this is a classic case of anthropomorphism well it's in our nature to assign human feelings and behaviors to animals the truth tends to be much more scientific and much less acute um kangaroo and grieving photos may have been killed while trying to make scientists as and then we get right through to you know CBS New York Post in the Metro saying that this was kangaroo necrophilia that the public are mistaking of the tenderness um the New York Post refers to the male kangaroo is a horny killer and the Metro um refers to this as as an act of rape so in light of all of this news scientific evidence and the new factual evidence that came forward and the coverage of um the the story the new story now by the media what happened well I just want to sort of compare these two stories that what's at the heart of these two stories first of all I'm just going to give you the example,23
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,24:08,from The Daily Mail so here we have um please don't die the heart-wrenching moments a mother kangaroo reaches for a joey one last time before dying in the arms of our male companion compared to the guardian which I'm going to take as the sort of midpoint here um of the um the the coverage of the of the scientists and Kangaroo and grieving photos may have killed while trying to mate scientists as and think about what these framing devices are doing so in the first one the first interpretation we are asked to think about this in terms of cues which we take from melodrama so we look at the outstretched arms of the female we look at her eye line we look at the fact that the male is holding her head he seems to be holding it tenderly he puts their head down on the floor we are told that this story is a story of a family unit it brings to mind the ideas of maternal sacrifice it certainly gives us a sense that kangaroos have an emotional inner,24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,25:10,life and it's something that we can share we understand that sense of trauma and distress when a loved one dies compare that to the way in which the um the story is reframed after the scientists evidence um and at best it becomes some sort of horror at worst it's some sort of sex comedy and the focus we're asked to shift our Focus so no more are we looking at the outstretched arms and the arms folding the head of the female tenderly instead we're asked to look at the scrotum of the male so we're asked to shift our visual cues in line with our generic expectations so the genre that we've suddenly moved into changes the way in which we're supposed to view these images but the public completely rejected not completely but but pretty much rejected the what we call the horny kangaroo story and continue to accept The Grieving,25
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,26:14,kangaroo story and the Google searches for grieving and mourning Forex actually um exceeded those for the horny kangaroo story and the media social media shares again um completely outstripped and The Grieving story completely outstripped the horny story and even when people were posting the idea of the um the story of the um the the the female dying because of mating um people were um repeating that and saying No this is a story of grieving and the public engagement was huge and there was a real pushback against the scientific accounts so we have the popular accounts and we have the scientific account and there was a huge pushback against the scientific account so what we have here is a story of students sorry of sticky animal emotion there was a real public disinteresting and a refused all of that alternative reading and this was because when we,26
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,27:16,have emotions or feelings which suddenly become attached to subject or objects or even places they tend to become sticky those stories become sticky so when we have feelings about a story when it's in when it engages us emotionally that story becomes much stickier than if you have just factual evidence presented and so in this case because this was a story of emotion it was something that people could understand the story stuck with them because their emotions their feeling their feelings became attached to the to the subject um and because of that the kangaroo grief and the idea of kangaroo brief became a sticky story um what we had there was a shared genre cues so people understood and those cues are very strong so remember the the melodrama cues which are about kind of this sense of touch so the male touching the female the way in which the female is looking the idea of maternal sacrifice in the family unit and so on,27
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,28:20,and there was a shared meaning and an emotional experience which could be understood between human and animal so it became very difficult to dismantle and re-establish new meanings for the cues in this particular case so even though the public were presented with what we might think of as the facts of the story because those facts did not in any way talk about kangaroo emotion the public completely rejected it so what we can see from this is there are real emotional appeals in stories that use genre cues and stories that use gendered norms and I'll come back to this because this relates to a study that we did um with the center for human animal studies which I'm going to talk about a little bit at the end so gendered Norms particularly parent family or parent-child relationships are ones that engage um audiences they engage people in the,28
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,29:23,story because they're relatable we had in terms of genre we had the melodrama versus the sexual comedy or even perhaps a horror there were gender stereotypes that were easily transferable to the kangaroos anthropomorphism was constructed by scientists as the public mistake but in doing that they denied that kangaroos had an emotional life and so this was refuted this was outrightly rejected by the public so there was a greater public interest in this story of kangaroo grief so I want to tell you a second story now and this is one where the narrative became unstuck and we got a new sticky narrative in its place and this is the story of slow lorises and um many of you will actually know about this um because it's a campaign that was um created by International animal,29
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,30:23,rescue um quite a few years ago now but it's still ongoing and it was in response to some videos of slow lorises who were being capped as pets and particularly this um one video which was about a slow loris or it was a group of videos about a slow loris called Sonia um and this video went viral and so in the video we would see for example slow lorises there were other ones as well but we would often see slower lauristers who were cactus pets holding little mini umbrellas um eating fruit and looking into the camera um lifting their arms up because supposedly they were enjoying being brushed groomed or combed in this case um and often seen eating and being given food to eat rice balls with videos of that and Sonia became a sort of viral star of these videos um with millions and millions of shares,30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,31:28,of the videos and underneath those those videos you would see people saying oh she's so cute she's cute she's adorable I want one where can I get one um and so forth and in fact there was a study done and it was noted that the trend for keeping slow lorises as pets um and this pet trade is supported by um illegal capture the the pet trade in solarises is illegal um and but the um the tram for keeping slow laurices grew as a result of um or in large part as a result of these videos being shared so widely um across social media but the truth of these videos was that the arm lifting which people saw is so cute and often you would see this image of Sonia being tickled and lifting her arms up in fact what was,31
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,32:28,happening was that she was lifting her arms up because she was trying to recruit Venom from a brachial glands in her arms um and lorises only do this when they're absolutely terrified they have to be petrified to do this but she's doing this and she's trying to recruit the Venom it's then transferred into their mouths and then they will bite and that's how they transfer the venom through the bite so what we're seeing here is actually a loris who is who is absolutely terrified for her life and so International animal rescue um created a video um and in it um they made a whole series of very strong emotional appeals to the audience and what they did that was really important was they took the original Sonia footage um and they re-cut it with images of documentary images of what happens in the illegal Loris trade and that included things like tooth extraction so um before the before the lorises go into,32
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,33:28,the pat trade and they're taken and their teeth are pulled out with pliers without any sort of anesthetic um many of the lorises died during capture during transportation um when Laura says they're very uh affected by uh by strong light um and so being put into houses and obviously in front of cameras and so on um with strong lights that again was was a form of torture for them and so um Peter Egan was asked to front the ducky the the small sort of documentary um video that circulated um and in it he had a commentary that was really fascinating he did the piece to camera so he's talking to camera and what he did was ask questions and they were along the lines of if you knew that this was torture for the Loris would you really find it cute if you knew that she was terrified would you want to share this so there was a questioning right the way through the commentary he was,33
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,34:27,asking people how do you feel now you know that this is how Sonia actually fails so they reorganized The Narrative they took the original story they took the original footage of the Sonia videos and they cut it together with the images of the illegal um Pat trade and what happens to Laura says um and as a result of that um there was a huge um and it was it was very very popular there was there was a huge public outcry against the the Slow Loris videos and so what we found was um I did a short study um on this particular campaign and the results of this campaign um and um what happened was that the there was an active public dissemination of the message so the public were posting the link to the um iar video and the campaign website in the comments for the slow loris video um so they were actively participating,34

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,36:32,so this isn't this is an example of unsticking um and creating a new sticky uh sticky narrative and both interpretations doloresces were attributed with an emotional life in one of them she's happy and enjoying everything and in the other she's being tortured and it's Dreadful and and awful we get this shift from cute to um acute response to an empathy response and the public were mobilized and they actively spread the message so I think what's really key here is that we can see again just to remind you of those uh those genre cues when we see the slow loris and she's holding an umbrella or feeding herself with rice balls we're we're meant to see it in a fun comedic frame so the genre cues are see this as a comedy our response is oh that's cute oh that's funny um whereas when it was reframed through the video that was circulated with Peter Egan's commentary we then have the drama in the documentary cues it becomes serious we're told to understand or,36
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,37:36,reinterpret the story in a different way and to reinterpret her emotional um State as well which was important so what we got was a shift we was no longer looking at the cube Loris instead we're identifying with her distress and then finally and very quickly I want to mention ocure so um I just want to mention this because of the genre mixing that went on in this and so what archaea did it was a film released in 2017 it was a Netflix original movie um it was incredibly popular it was a story of um a Super Pig um who is um the part of a small girl and the Super Pig is then reclaimed by the organization that's produced these genetically modified pegs and it's the story of her being rescued about you being rescued and reunited um with um with her young,37
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,38:34,um companion a young human companion what this film did was that it drew on um a whole range of different genre cues but it Incorporated the realities of slaughterhouse practices and gave them a kind of fantasy element it's what I call an advocacy Fiction it's a form of political filmmaking um and what was really interesting was that this was a film that um absolutely without any shadow of a doubt increased the public engagement with um the animal Liberation friends and changed the narrative around the animal Liberation Front so there were huge shares on social media there were a lot of people who were posting about how they thought the animal Liberation Front was great it was a huge peak in interest in the ALF um after the film's release um and a lot of shares on social media talking about how the AL after your really really great work um but there were a lot of concerns raised about the Disney fight images,38
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,39:37,that was used that we used to market the films a few of those images there um and you can see you know okay the Super Pig um greatly anthropomorphized in the film she behaves like a great big puppy um and concerns that actually this was used and it disguised the horror of the film and so children it wasn't suitable for children um and people were really concerned and actually adults said we need to keep children away from this film because it could actually turn them a vegetarian um oh the horror um and in fact um I had a look and I was really interested to get a snapshot of the public reception of this film so I did a really short little study of this um and it turned out that 63 percent of parents um said that the movie wasn't suitable for children however 81 of children who watch this film were positive about it and they said yes it was scary but it was scary because it,39
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,40:37,depicts the realities of industrial farming and Slaughter and pretty much across the 81 percent they said that it shouldn't stop adults and children watching it and they should watch it for both entertainment and educational reasons there's a little quote here from somebody who was 14 who said you need to watch this film yes it will haunt you for weeks but the concept and the message behind it is eye-opening there was a big public impact from this film just mention a few things Peter had 21 000 requests for vegan starter kits in the month following the film's release the Egypt surge of public support for the ALF on the um the film's social media channels people um anecdotally decided to go talk about deciding to go vegan after watching the film um so a lot of public impact that we know came from that particular film it used anthropomorphism it used it and it used the dysnification,40
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,41:35,um to depict the realities of slaughterhouse operations and that film's anthropomorphic message importantly reads children and young people and that's another one of the reasons why I think that we have to review our use of anthropomorphism and draw it into the range of different tactics that we can use when we're telling stories about animals so I think the anthropomorphism then is a strategy I think we can rewrite the meanings of animals and their experiences I do believe they can mobilize public empathy for other animals a couple of caveats just to mention here these are results that we got from a study that we did um which was funded by the vegan Society um it was done by myself and my colleagues at the center Pig human animal studies we do need to be careful because there is a degree of cynicism um from people when you overtly anthropomorphize however what we did find was that anthropomorphism is tends to be a natural outcome when people are looking at images people respond very well to images particularly of images,41
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,42:42,young of images of young animals or relationships between parent and child and so on um anthropomorphic narratives are a really great way of communicating increasing trust and awareness um but we need to be careful about um designing narratives that somehow elicit guilt and one of the things that was very interesting was we did find that shocking or distressing um imagery often leads to disengagement another reason I think that anthropomorphism can be a really good way of getting past that so my top 10 key takeaways to finish um for you then use anthropomorphism as a narrative strategy intertextuality link your message to existing popular cultural narratives remember the The Links at the beginning and to Butch in the Sundance and books and Sundance and so forth look out for cultural moments successful films or media stories that capture the public attention and capitalize on those,42
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,43:42,try to produce sticky narratives remember that emotions and feelings attach to narratives to stories to subjects you need to engage the emotions of people when you tell a story and the emotional lives of animals can be shared experiences that people can identify with people respond very well to those parent family child relationships and also to um Companion Animal relationships think about genre cues to help shape your audience's understanding um create those sticky narratives use individual named animals that can work really well different audiences need different narratives um not everything is going to work for everybody um if you are thinking about how to create content one of the things I would strongly ask you to do is to consider now Comics graphic novels and children's books I think it's really important that we're entering into those areas it's also really unlikely that one story is going to change any individual's mind or habits we need lots of stories out there,43
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,44:43,um I've got some resources for you at the end here um all of the examples that I've given to you today I've written about uh they're in various books and things that um I've been involved in or studies that I've done so you could follow up any of those through um the the resources that I've given me there I've also given a link there to social issue graphic novels that's really just um it's a short piece which just explains about how graphic novels are being used nowadays I think it's something that we should be using a little bit more and so I'll be really interested in in people's responses uh thank you very much I'll just put that next slide on for you Natalie great thank you so much Claire that was amazing um just to let everyone know um Beth is going to share Claire's slide deck so you'll be able to access the um resources and kind of jog your memory about all the amazing insights that Claire shared and we'll also share it on our narrative newsletter and I think,44
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,45:44,Beth's going to put a link in the chat if people aren't already signed up to our narrative change for animal Freedom newsletter you can sign up to that and this is where you can also find out more about other upcoming webinars we've got so we've been having kind of conversations with um great thinkers like Claire or we're also sharing our own research and from animal think tank as well so um yeah that's gonna send a link in the chat to the newsletter and also our next webinar which is going to be looking at our latest public research so if you don't mind um stopping sharing your screen and then we can open up the floor to some questions so feel free to either put question is the chat or you can either raise your digital hand and ask Claire um directly but yeah Claire just thank you for an amazing webinar I just think yeah you really showed how anthropomorphism is like a bridge to helping us identify with other animals so yeah that's my big takeaway from this so yeah feel free to put any questions you have in the chat for Claire I'm sure there's lots of um thoughts and ideas,45
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,46:50,people will be taken away from this foreign thank you so much Claire that was so interesting um I guess what stripped me and I'll try and uh communicate the succinctly but I um something we put up against when we um you know via our research and counter narratives that work is that sometimes they're narratives that we actually don't really want to uh you know um activate in people like for example that it can be that it's actually it's actually cheaper to eat a plant-based diet we don't necessarily want to activate that in people when we're trying to create values around caring for other animals rather than caring for our pockets so I guess from that perspective I was wondering in a sort of strategic way we know that Disney vacation is problematic as well as having these great um emotional,46
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,47:59,um impacts on people like Finding Dory was one of the examples you used um if we're going to sort of capitalize on that how do we avoid sort of longer term damage how do we do it sensible and strategically I think this is real very much on a case-by-case basis I don't know that I could give you a general rule here for this because I think what you have to do is you you you have to think very carefully about the sort of resources and sources that you're using I don't think that you can necessarily see all of the long-term impacts and how people are going to interpret things and the sorts of messages um it can be very difficult and not denying that it can be very very difficult what I think that we have to do though is we have to take that step and we have to actually explore the opportunities that we've got to do it because if we don't we're missing out here I think we're seriously missing um yeah missing out on some great opportunities I think if you look to for,47
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,49:04,example a conservation movement at the moment actually the conservation movement is doing this they're actually jumping on every popular film that comes out that has any kind of conservation message attached to it or anything to do with individual species and they're trying to use that message to capture the public attention so even if it's something the film doesn't necessarily have that message in it at all they're still using it because it's a way of if you're like getting um a public that's already pre-cued to understand that yes I am interested in that particular species or yes I have an emotional attachment because I saw the film and so forth I think that there are real risks in a lot of this as well and the key risk that I often say that happens is that people become really engaged oh I love that I want that as a pet that is one of the things that I think we see all the time and we do need to be incredibly careful because,48
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,50:06,and there's there's a huge risk and we say it with all the popular films that come out um and we say it with the uh popular the viral content that gets you know distributed on social on social media and so there are big risks that there are and I'm I'm not trying to underplay those and one of the things that I do I've written a book on other people and one of the things that I say is that is that we can see it and we can be critical of it and we can see the benefits of it and both of those things can happen at the same time and sometimes it's about taking a calculated risk here because if you are able to reach what could potentially be millions and millions of people then is it not worth taking that that step and yes there could be possible risks there but there is as well a way of potentially reaching lots of people and if the message is really well crafted I do believe that it can get through I think that the slow loris campaign is a really good example of that because,49
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,51:11,there was no doubt I mean this was still about laurices being cute and being adorable and do we really want to hurt them but it engaged people's empathy so I think that the the message got out there I mean we're still seeing it huge and still a huge pack trade in slow lorises however it did have an impact it engaged the public and there was a kickback and there was public dissemination they were active in spreading the message so I do believe that um a carefully crafted message is possible it is still possible to engage people's if you like take the cute response continue to engage that and convert that into an empathetic response which doesn't then become oh I need to you know possess that animal as you know as a pet so I think there's ways of doing it yes and I do think there's risks as well but I also think there's great benefits either we have to um stop being frightened of using it and you know start engaging with,50
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,52:14,anthropomorphic narratives I do think it's a really great way of reaching children and young people too and I don't think we should be afraid of using that don't forget that in science communication when animal behaviorists want to talk to the public about their science they have to anthropomorphize it in their science communication it's it's one of the things that behaviorist Haze is that they have to have to anthropomorphize but that's how you have to do it you have to talk to people in a language that they can understand and I think we have to stop being frightened of that thank you um Richard do you want to ask your question thanks Natalie uh can you hear me okay yeah yeah right uh yeah disclaimer I'm a friend and colleague of Claire so um yeah uh so as we know I think dominant discourses are very good at labeling challenges to their Authority as ideological and uh pretending that their own messaging and discourses are not in some way uh ideological,51
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,53:19,um and I think most of us would agree that the children are um manipulated in our meat culture into um not reflecting on um the realities of animal Slaughter and so on and so forth and your talk made me think of an uh form of media that I've been interested in for a few years and and that is children's picture books um because as you know I did do some teaching on Early Childhood studies and and I've been uh yeah trying to um develop some kind of interest in in taking critical animal studies and taking out together with um childhood studies as well um so how in light of what you've been saying and the kind of positive construction of anthropomorphism um how how can um activist groups and so on kind of avoid the accusation of sort of manipulating children through through the creation of um,52
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,54:24,um kind of positive anthropomorphism in their in their kind of narrative building because that's that's almost the inevitable charge that will be um leveled against um such groups yeah and and I I hate to say this but I think that is just inevitable that that's going to happen because there's such a fair there's such a fair of the sorts of stories that we need to tell children that that is the defense that they bring to this you know the ideas of you know manipulation and as you say you know that this is ideological and completely ignore the fact that me culture is built on you know ideological grounds so um I I don't know that I've necessarily got an answer to how we defend ourselves against that charge because I just think that that is the charge that's always going to be brought against us but I don't think that again I can decide I think that should stop us doing this um I don't know that I've necessarily got a way of of of refuting that you know at this at this point,53
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,55:30,Richard by the way can I just come back and say say well I guess the the um you know the contesting me culture is actually trying to get at at or a closer um approximation of the reality of what happens to um non-human animals whereas meat culture is trying to disguise it and you know there's a just there's just a basic kind of um fight over truth there yeah although they they might say that if you're using entrepreneurism in certain ways that you're kind of veering away from the truth then I know there's yeah I don't think that I don't think that we even need to worry ourselves with that charge to be honest because all stories you know for children are anthropomorphic anyway so you know whether it's Charlotte's Web or babe or we're telling the truths of you know reality um the realities of the slaughterhouse which Akia does it gives us the realities of the slaughterhouse in a in in quite a Fantastical and dignified way but it's still the realities of it and,54
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,56:30,children could engage with that and yes they hated it and yes many of them decided to go vegetarian much to their parents horror um you know but but they understood that those were the realities of it and it was a way to actually reach them could I just point out the um um I just saw uh Kim Kim stores in the chat said he'd like to say something briefly about his project I'd be really interested in Kim's comments yeah I've just done a time check with any yeah we've then got a couple of minutes left but really do you want to hear what you've got to say um as well Tim I'm also conscious there's another question in the chat so if you're able to give it to a couple of minutes that'd be great Kim well um thank you very much Claire for the presentation it was really helpful and and I think what I'd like to do is arrange a date where you and I can talk directly on our own but the issue of anthropomorphism is is such a complex issue and in writing the biography of of Topsy an elephant who was killed in 1903 I'm it's narrative non-fiction style of,55
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,57:32,writing whereby I'm writing it in three different voices so there is her voice my voice my opinion plus um third person investigative reporting so as as a reader reads through the book they'll read what happens to Topsy as she experiences it and she feels and sees it but then the next section will be in the third person investigation reporting that will then report upon what actually happened to her so the reader will get multiple points of view about what happened to her life and I and I want to you know hopefully the book will be seen as part of the rich tradition of Black Beauty um Watership Down you know many other novels that have been um well mine's not a novel but many other books about individual animals or groups of animals that have made a big difference in how people think about them yeah great strategy yeah I really like that approach and yeah happy to have a chat with him anytime um and yeah kind of thinking what,56
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,58:32,Richard said it's like obviously the industry uses unsolization so like their own means but then also uses it as a weapon to criticize us but they know it's effective so yeah and I guess like Claire says it's been Mindful and intentional and making absolutely I think just just a very quick one to mention for example um you they all have seen that um you know Farmers um broadly you know than the certainly in the UK the Farmers Union you know accuses people of anthropomorphizing um cows and tells us that we shouldn't do that and um yeah it still has Happy Cow weekend where Farmers posts pictures of their cows and tell us that they're happy on social media and of course they use Happy Cow imagery to sell dairy products so um you know I think what we have to do is we have to harness it as well because everyone else is using it and we need to do it and we need to do it on our own terms if people need to go that's understandable but I'm just going to put,57
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,59:30,one last question to um Claire because it's quite an interesting one from Tristan saying any thoughts suggestions regarding changing narratives about animals who are more alien than ourselves or less aesthetic such as muscles or oysters yeah you know I think this is this is so important and actually I think this is where anthropomorphism is really important because I I believe that we can um through anthropomorphism we can give a view into lives of animals that would be otherwise you know so distant from us that it's really really difficult so for people to make any kind of empathetic connections so um in one sense I'm actually going to say that I believe this is the point where the more I'm going to say Disney fight you go with this the better because you almost have to overtly anthropomorphize so that you can draw people in and engage them in the lives as you say I mean um I think the um the example that you gave muscles or roosters you know you you have to give a sense of,58
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,1:00:34,um what they experienced you know and I think that that can be incredibly difficult you know I think there's been problems with people trying to um engage with fishermen for a long time people so well it's really really hard you can't get people to think about fish and then we do get films about fish for example like Finding Dory and so when we get characters that people can relate to um and understand so I think we have to create characters we have to individuate we have to use all of the narrative techniques that are just at our disposal we have to tell stories that people understand and a lot of those have to be perhaps um about you know about relationships about the experiences of the end of an individual oyster or an individual muscle um and um that I think it's a way of engaging audiences and it's probably the only way because through fact you are not going to reach people you can tell people the facts of the lives of oysters and muscles you are not going to reach people because they are too distant,59
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,1:01:40,um but if you give them a story if you give them something which is framed in such a way that they can relate to it and especially if you can offer some sort of relationship or emotional experience something that is is shared that could be um that can be identified with distress pain you know whatever that might be Joy um as long as there's something which is um which is emotionally engaging and I think emotion is really important here I think it's important that we create emotional life worlds for Animals through these anthropomorphic narratives because that's what people relate to and that's what they find engaging um so yes I think we should that's why I think we should do it for animals that are really difficult for us to relate thanks now I think it's that thing of show don't tell because like you say if you use facts or just say animals are sentient that doesn't really move people but if you're showing animals and sending it through the stories you tell I'm thinking of like my octopus teacher exactly so profoundly yeah yeah yeah yeah that's a really great example yes,60
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BBqqSpVJpw,New Narratives for Animal Freedom Advocacy- A webinar with Claire Parkinson,Animal Think Tank,27 Jun 2023,1:02:44,yeah oh thank you so much Claire and thank you everyone for joining us and I hope to see you at our next webinar next month thank you bye thanks Claire,61

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,0:01,so does anyone know who this man is um if you do you can put it in the chat and Natalie can shout out if there's anybody's got the right answer or any answers nothing coming through nothing coming through fair enough okay so this is oh Donald Watson no no far from it actually um this is leis Powell and he was a lawyer and a future Supreme Court judge in the US who wrote something called the power memo in 1971 and as a conservative he was very concerned by the radical ideas being spread by the social movements of the time and so he wrote this 30 page memo um which many have credited as a blueprint for the rise of modern neoliberalism and he laid out a long-term plan to Capt key institutions like the media and like universities and Academia um to reverse these radical Trends and his plan worked,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,1:12,next so if we want to get from the horror of where we are now next to a world where all animals are free to live as they choose then we need our own version of the pal memo we need a long-term movement strategy or or road map uh because transformational change isn't achieved just because it's morally right we need a strategy that focuses our attention and energy so so that we can actually achieve a meaningful breakthrough rather than pursuing lots of different goals at once and not achieving a meaningful breakthrough in any of them um next next uh now I realize that the animal movement is unique in many ways you know we're an ally movement for starters and we're dealing with a massively complex issue but we still have so much to learn from other social movements past movements have built unity and momentum around long-term shared goals so for Indian independence the goal was to kick the British out of India and to have,2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,2:17,self-rule and this goal helped to create unity and some kind of cohesion between all the different efforts that were taking place for the civil rights movement in the 60s they focused on lots of different campaigns but on two key areas first on desegregation and then they mve to voting rights and for the LGBT movement marriage equality was a big goal that has been achieved on the way to the bigger goal of equality under the law and marriage equality was chosen as the goal amongst many other goals that could have been chosen um and it was chosen in part because the conversations that it catalyzed about love and family and commitment enabled people to shift their attitudes about gay people more broadly and open up opportunities um to win further rights you know down the road so it was a very strategic goal next so there is a difference between campaign strategy and movement strategy and to achieve the transformative change that we want um we need to take a,3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,3:20,long-term movement perspective to imagine change across decades rather than across campaign Cycles where I think most of us are focused and ultimately movements are multigenerational so taking a movement perspective means deciding which aspect of the issue we want to address in this generation and what Foundation we want to build and leave for the generations that come after us next so at animal think tank we are very persuaded that we need to take a long-term movement perspective to achieve the transformative change that we want for and with other animals and over the last 16 months we've been working to develop a year movement level strategy for ourselves primarily but also hopefully one um that can serve the broader UK UK um movement ecosystem next um so in this talk I'm going to share firstly um some of the key ingredients and guiding principles,4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,4:19,of good strategy that I've pinched from a lot of great resources um secondly um animal think tanks long-term strategy work over the last 16 months you know I'm going to share our meth methodology and finally I'm going to share some of our interim results and insights that we've surfaced so far and share what's still left to be done next so I'm as I said I'm drawing from a range of really great resources um both sort of movement strategy books and also movement and sorry business um strategy books um as well as drawing from interviews with movement strategists like Ian Mar from the artour movement Evan wolson and Doug hatway from the freedom to marry campaign and Paul Engler co-author of this is an uprising so the first half of this talk there's not going to be any original ideas or any of my original ideas it's a it's a distillation of some of the insights that um we've gathered through these resources and these conversations next next so firstly What is strategy um,5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,5:27,there are you know actually when I was doing research for this talk You' think that I would have a really clear definition of what strategy is but I had to um get it from somewhere else and I really like this um definition from practical radicals which defines strategy as a plan to achieve a goal under conditions of uncertainty with limited resources facing opposition next um and Richard rumelt who's author of the classic book good strategy bad strategy says that strategy is essentially problem solving and you can't solve a problem that you've not understood next so what are some key ingredients of good strategy next uh we need a diagnosis or an analysis of the current situation which answers key questions like where are we now uh what are the key issues and what are the key opportunities next a good diagnosis is about fully understanding the nature of,6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,6:27,the challenge and that really helps us to then identify opportunities for change next and a really important aspect of um the diagnosis is understanding power um your power and the power of the opposition and finding ways to concentrate your power to achieve your goals so Progressive movements like ours often rely on something called solidarity power and this is about building networks and alliances and Collective action you know to be able to amplify their voice um and their actions um they often also rely on disruptive power such as strikes um and they rely also on ideological power especially when movements are aiming to shift societal values and norms and narratives um and influence uh cultural institutions next so uh secondly we need a clear ambitious goal or vision for the future which answers the question where do do,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,7:29,we want to go next so a clear and compelling vision is essential for organizing and mobilizing people towards creating a better world and this Vision should be rooted in Universal human values and aspirations so it really speaks to people's hearts and moves them to act next and we need a plan from getting from uh here to there which answers questions like how do we get there and what steps are we going to take and um a good plan includes something called a guiding approach uh it includes uh coherent actions and it includes high level goals or Milestones so a guiding approach good strategies have a guiding approach uh which marks the direction forward but doesn't necessarily Define all the details um so guiding approaches Define your methods and help you rule out lots of other possible ction s so in,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,8:31,a social movement context this can be influenced by our conceptual or highlevel theory of change so for example um is our guiding approach about putting pressure on the system from outside through protest or is it um trying to put pressure on the system from inside through lobbying are we focused on individual change or are we focused on systemic change are we focusing on legislative change or cultural or narrative change um so practical radical um details seven approaches guiding approaches or strategies um which include Base building or Community organizing disruption narrative shift um inside outside campaigns electoral change and so on and they argue that you choose your strategy model or your strategic approach based on your assessment of your own power and the current context and that really a combination of these strategies are needed to win and that transformative change requires you know each of these strategies at different times,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,9:37,next so in fact uh every resource that we've consulted and every person that we've talked to um and you know our learnings from other social movements shows that we need a combination of methods to win there is no one right strategic approach um and so this is Ella Baker she was a legendary organizer in the civil rights movement and she promoted a strategy of baseb building in the South you know from in the 1940s and 50s and this really laid the groundwork for identifying and training Grassroots leaders long before the big campaigns that we know about in the 60s you know like the lunch counter stins and the freedom rinds so you know the Civil Rights movements uh the breakthroughs and that they experienc really depended on both you know slow and patient organizing and these dramatic actions and campaigns it also relied on working with legislators uh registering voters sharing powerful images to make moral claims so you know no single method alone would have worked,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,10:42,next so uh this is Evan wolson a leader of the freedom to marry movement and he talk he's written a lot about strategy and this is one of the main things he does now advising others on on good strategy and he talks about social movement strategy needing to use many methods uh combining various approaches like litigation legislation direct action public education and persuasion and different moments in history call for specific combinations of methods so our job as um self-appointed movement strategists is to sense what combination of strategies or approaches are needed at this time and in this context and then also sense when it's time to shift to other approaches next so a winning strategy needs a set of actions that are coherent and coordinated with the guiding approach that we choose um that effectively address the challenges laid out in the diagnosis that um I talked about earlier and really to have power actions in the,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,11:45,strategy should work together synergistically and build on one another next um and then finally a winning strategy you know as I said needs Milestones or goals along the way next and these are really guide post that move us along the way to achieving our long-term impact and they really help to orient us and focus us um so for example with freedom to marry yeah their overarching goal or Vision was to win marriage equality at the Supreme Court level but they aimed to build a critical mass of states and a critical mass of public support that together would create the climate for that Supreme Court win um and next and as um linear and logical as all of this is sounding the reality is of course very different um and as Evan wolson said we may be held up today as a model but for most of it it's been a model so you know while much of their work was very strategic much of it was also about reacting to events and taking the opportunities that they saw next okay so what are some key,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,12:50,principles of good strategy next so the the most basic idea of strategy is the application of strength against weakness or strength applied to the most promising opportunity uh and two important sources of strength are one changing how we see a situation so powerful strategies often come from these fresh insights which can uncover New Opportunities and risks and then secondly having a coherent strategy you know a good strategy creates strength through the coherence of its design uh next uh and given uh good strategy often comes from a new and surprising understanding of a situation it might actually seem quite obvious in hindsight because it fits the situation so well but it's based on unique ideas that maybe others haven't noticed next um and as I've said you know a good strategy is designed to be coherent so all of the actions need to be reinforcing and supporting each other and I I think this is really important,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,13:56,this coherence is a source of power um and so a lot of strategies you know that that that that we know about are not actually designed and it's set instead are a list of independent or conflicting objectives so we have to be really really careful to design our strategies so that the actions are coherent um and a similar kind of concept um next um you know good strategy is focused um and not dispersed you know so it involves prioritizing what is most critical it's as much of about what you don't do as it is about what you do um and Ronald raml said in his book you know strategy is about focus and most complex organizations don't Focus their resources instead they pursue multiple goals at once not concentrating enough resource to achieve a breakthrough in any of them now I think this is really important and implies at the movement level as well you know are we trying to pursue too many different goals and issues at once and not actually concentrating resources,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,15:00,enough to achieve a meaningful breakthrough in any one of them I invite you to put your opinions about this in the chat um yes so people can be reading through okay uh effective strategies sorry next Natalie also use um leverage which is about um the you know the smallest effort yielding the largest impact and then a good strategy also is adaptable can adapt to changing circumstances and new knowledge but within the guiding approach and then finally you know good strategy is just a hypothesis about what will work that can be tested and refined over time oh sorry next Natalie um next next bit of thinking going on um okay so and you know ultimately we're operating um in complex systems which cannot be fully predicted Ed or controlled like actually you know we can't predict everything or or even,15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,16:03,anything I suppose but by studying these systems it really helps us to make more intelligent bets um and you know change in complex systems can be gradual or they can be sudden and unexpected you know nothing seems to change until suddenly it does and sometimes unexpected events create opportunities for major change that were once considered impossible so we really need to develop our capacity to understand understand these windows of opportunities provided by events and build our capacity to take advantage of them and it's often at these times when our long-term work of building our base of transforming attitudes and Norms of building trust and relationships within the movement ecosystems and building our own strategic capacity and so on can suddenly come to fruition next Okay so we've talked about um you know good strategy principles and ingredients conceptually um and now I'll talk a bit about how animal think tanks um strategy work has been applying these principles,16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,17:09,and you know what we've been been doing over the last um 16 months so uh you know our diagnosis has involved a range of analysis oh sorry next um a range of analysis and Frameworks and is a continuous uh process really next um but one uh thing I wanted to to kind of share is that one of the ways that we've understood the problem of animal exploitation is through um three main forces based on David Net's analysis in animal rights human rights um entanglements of Oppression and Liberation which is a brilliant book if people haven't have come across it um and David nber talks about yeah these three main forces um of economic exploitation and commodification of animals um by humans and capital seeking profit um secondly unequal power power with political and economic power concentrated in governments and corporations and thirdly ideological control through ideas stories and attitudes based on things like dominionism and human Supremacy that,17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,18:14,allows the system to maintain itself so that means um that our long-term strategy really needs to make transformations in these three key areas um next now so we've got our something around our diagnosis and then remember I said we needed to have a vision so our vision and which we've sort of written out really in our mission statement for animal think tank is that all individual animals have their rights to life freedom and bodily autonomy protected in UK law and embraced by Society so this means a goal of both legislative and cultural change um and remember I said that a vision needs to be inspiring uh and move people to act so I'm not sure how inspiring this is to the average person so what we're doing is currently developing a broader V Vision that's rooted in human values and that can really resonate with and inspire people um and we'll be doing focus groups to test and refine that to see to make sure that it lands as well as it as as well as it can next and so we've spent the last 16,18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,19:19,months then doing a range of consultations to surface ideas and opportunities to really think about what's what's the plan um to get from where we are now to our vision um and we've consulted so many stakeholders from across the movement ecosystem uh including leaders of organizations and legal and political experts to help us to identify strategic opportunities and risks and we've got advice from strategists and experts from other successful movements we've also consulted uh the meat eating public through focus groups to identify opportunities to leverage public opinion and we've also gathered ideas from Grassroots activists through larger workshops and through all of these consultations we have gained such invaluable insights and learn so much um as an organization and in time we really hope to share um some of these insights with a wider movement in published reports um and also by Consulting others one of our aims was to build a sense of,19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,20:21,um what we're now calling build in rather than Buy in so really getting people involved in the in the develop and the methodology rather than handing them a strategy and saying hey isn't this great and trying to persuade people that you know this is this is the way forward but really taking a participat as participatory approach as possible um and you know we we're feeling very grateful to have had such a lot of support and encouragement from players across the movement ecosystem you know many of whom recognize that we need something like this to help us and really focus our combined efforts and Achieve meaningful breakthroughs next and ultimately what we want to do is come out with a plan um that's sort of simple and powerful and we're using this framework from uh the center for International Center for nonviolent conflict icnc um and the idea is that we um have a ground objective something that we're really aiming for in say 40 years and then we have the Strategic Milestones or the intermediate steps,20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,21:24,that are crucial for achieving this ground objective so the milestone could be things that we can achieve in five to say five to 15 years and then for each Milestone there'll be campaigns that help us achieve the Milestone and then tactics that help us achieve the campaign demands um and you know this is ultimately what we're trying to populate for a simple but powerful strategy and obviously it's not as linear or as simple as this um and often you know many of the milestones and and the campaigns will be happening um in parallel um but hopefully coherently um and so if we think about um uh other movements you know the Civil Rights Movement the goal was equality for so the grand objective might be you know equality for African-Americans and their Milestones you know we focusing on particular issues or Focus areas desegregation voting rights and then they had a diversity of campaigns and actions within each issue um yeah obviously this is a simplification but uh this is what we're going for um and so I'm just sorry next,21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,22:29,Natalie um I'm just going to spend the rest of this uh talk uh yeah sharing you know some of the insights um that we found so far and I should say that we have a huge amount of data and we're currently still waiting through it um and I can only really share a little bit of the analysis that we've done so far because of time um but hopefully this will um wet your appetite for what's going to come hopefully later in the year so next through the consultation um several strategic Pathways or themes have emerged which align with our theory of change and our goal of systemic change focused on animals so uh I'll go through the pathways but for each pathway we've identified insights and strategic opportunities and risks um so um I'll share some of the pathways and opportunities we're looking at so n yeah political representation for animals so here we're talking about things like a commissioner for animal protection similar to the Future Generations commissioner in Wales uh you know,22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,23:34,animals are not represented in politics and for some political theorists this is the prerequisite to actually getting right for other animals um and this came out through some of our consultations and you know before this I think many of us felt that it was you know we'd get rights first and then we'd talk about political representation but it seems like um yeah it's much more entangled and than we we first thought um next so then animal rights was obviously another pathway that came out um so winning fundamental rights for animals like the right to life freedom and autonomy uh rights that protect uh animals interests um like the right not to suffer and we're exploring Pathways that evolve beyond the tra traditional sort of property personhood or welfare rights divide drawing on more recent legal Theory and scholarship which has been new for us and is really exciting um to see what might emerge from that and I'm going to talk about this a bit more um in a few minutes next so a third pathway,23
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,24:36,is you know welfare enforcement and enhancement like Banning cages and factory farming you know all of which there is a lot of public support for and can be used um to push a more radical narrative to Shi shift public opinion to see other animals as individuals next and then another pathway is expanding I mean this is a bit more sort of legally but expanding the interpretation of um what's called unnecessary suffering in UK um law and Society through both welfarist and abolitionist campaigns and Welfare Enforcement cases and this is based on the idea that I our idea of necessary and unnecessary suffering is actually continuing to expand over time so um for example cosmetic testing is no longer seen as necessary animals used in circuses is no longer seen as necessary and this is the language that you is used in in UK Welfare Law of like um you not causing unnecessary suffering so what could we be campaigning for that would carry on expanding um this,24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,25:40,definition and interpretation in law um next so we've got uh another familiar Pathway to people so you know bans on particular practices um or uh Industries whether so animal testing horse and dog racing breeding of Animal Companions animal agriculture practices like tail docking or whole Industries like focusing on beef or dairy next um there's this pathway of what we've called removing the money so addressing subsidies divestment and also economic disruption through for example organizing workers um and also if we link back to um the welfare Pathways by trying to increase um production costs from you know enhanced welfare next um open rescue you know we have um reviewed legal opportunities for this approach and found some really in interesting avenues for defense um as well as for movement building and storytelling um and as the UK welfare laws are so much better than the US laws,25
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,26:46,um which is where actually this this um strategic approach is is really um sort of focused with you know direct action everywhere um doing you know open rescues and and uh having legal cases um and it could be that there's an opportunity to argue that the whole animal agriculture is industry is illegal and a criminal Enterprise so we're we're thinking about opportunities within the open rescue Paradigm um and then finally building movement power and this is fundamentally about bringing more people into the movement to take action collectively and focusing on emotive and popular sub isues that can really mobilize people who care about animals and build a broad and deep base so that we can build the power we need to make mean meaningful demands um and of course we believe that this um particular pathway is needed to facilitate all the other Pathways this is very much sort of an animal animal think tanks theory of change that we really need to build movement power and people power um to catalyze um the opportunities and shift the Overton window so that other pieces of the movement ecosystem can uh can be you,26
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,27:51,know become be pushing for more radical things um and of course um all of these pathways are connected um and many opportunities in one pathway um can move forward other Pathways so it's not really linear at all it's just the way that it's come out in the data and and and an easy way to explain um or or kind of slice up you know what's coming out um and others probably could slice it up in different ways um next okay so as I said for each of these Pathways we've identified insights opportunities and risks and also campaign ideas um and narrative shifts that are needed next um and as I said you know there's so much data it's really hard to go into um now we've got about 10 to 15 research reports sort of underway um but I'll whiz through some of the key insights and a few of the many things that are alive for us next so um when we chatted with Paul Engler co-author of this is an uprising,27
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,28:54,he told us that we needed to identify a popular sub isue uh to polarize society around and push forward our Narrative of animals as individuals with interests and inherent values so next um so targeting policies um that already have high levels of public support so for example Banning infant mother separation Banning Pig thumping um you know getting rid of hunting snares ending breeding dogs for animal testing and so many more next and and you know as part of you know trying to find these really popular sub issues that can polarize Society we've been researching Animal Welfare practices which are both in indefensible um so could cause moral outrage in the public um but also indispensable to the industry so could harm an industry which is already vulnerable um and this strategy could help many Pathways from ending factory farming to furthering you know fundamental rights and also political representation by highlighting the need for a more robust animal protection,28
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,30:00,structure within the government for example next we've also found that necessity is the most widely used justification or one of the most widely used justifications for eating animals and perceived harm depends strongly on perceived necessity um so one idea is that we really need to Target practices if this is an approach we're going to take that cannot be easily Justified as necessary next now a key Insight from our movement interviews and research is the necessity for a moral paradigm shift to achieve legislative progress and animal Freedom you know this isn't this isn't new um but the idea is that you know this shift would entail Society like a cultural shift and a narrative shift which you know society would recognize animals as individuals with intrinsic value rather than viewing them as property or Commodities um and so our interviews suggest that campaigns and legal approaches regardless of the specific,29

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,33:10,some sort of uh legal roundtables or get some legal Scholars and practitioners together to assess the feasibility of these ideas and how applicable um they are in the UK context um and one promising strategy um that I wanted to share because it's quite exciting to us um is pursuing what's called uh simple rights for animals for example Animal Welfare protection sort of reframing them as as sort of these simple rights which can then evolve into more fundamental rights like the right to life um uh autonomy uh and freedom and this is uh an an alternative to the sort of traditional route of going for personhood first um so next so to unpack the strategy a bit more um in law as I'm sure all of you know that there are two types of entities persons or things or things SL property and legal Scholars have argued that achieving moral or legal personhood is a goal we should go for as a precondition for animals to achieve fundamental rights you know uh rights like as I said,32
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,34:19,right to life Freedom bodly autonomy um and this is called the traditional view which is argued by people like Gary francione and the late stepen wise and it looks something like this triangle you know legal personhood is first and then you get legal and then you get um personhood uh rights and then private right of action and then finally legal standing where animals can you know defend themselves or defend their interests in courts so next however there's another view called the unorthodox view which suggests that animals already have these simple rights for example these welfare type rights um and some of these can be strengthened into fundamental rights so this is a a more kind of well the paper it comes from is called transition rather than Revolution um and you know this can be established through legislative change without the need to change animal status to persons first um and yeah this comes from legal scholar Eva kempers who argues that legal personhood or an equivalent status is,33
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,35:22,actually a potential consequence of growing animal rights rather than a condition for achieving them and she's talking about this based on the idea that the legal status of women and children developed more in you know in a similar manner to that um rather than you know personhood first and then getting rights and she outlines four steps you know in this triangle so it's an alternative triangle to the traditional view so simple rights first like you know welfare rights um some of which can evolve into fundamental rights and then uh then uh what does it say it's so small approach apprpriate incidence of legal personhood I mean this is incidence is a bit of legal jargon basically we're talking about different rights um like the like I said the right to life bodily autonomy right not to suffer even the right to own property is an incident of personhood and then the culmination of that is a personhood status or equivalent and this is pretty exciting to us because it opens up lots of strategic opportunities to go for say a particular right or legislation that,34
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,36:25,protects animals interests but that doesn't require personhood first um and it opens up an opportunity to try and evolve a simple right say that dogs hold um you know into a fundamental rights so for example a ban against tail docking um could potentially be um evolved into a right not to be tortured um and we are very much in this is a very conceptual argument um and we're in the process of exploring these opportunities and how to apply them in the UK context with um legal Scholars and yet practitioners um from a range of different perspectives so um it's just ideas at this stage but I think you know this strategy can also help us Bridge um what many of us feel is an unhelpful dichotomy between welfare and rights which I think undermines our efforts towards meaningful change so by reframing existing welfare protections as simple rights I think it could help with this um and many people also say that it's quite strategic to reframe to the public and also to,35
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,37:28,legislators um you know to say you know actually we're not asking for something revolutionary just an expansion of existing rights next so um focusing initially on winning rights for Animal Companions and then broadening to others is other animals also holds a lot of um potential for us so for exam example expanding the ban against hail docking um you know in do for dogs expanding that to pigs um another strategy that's being used in the UK is chipping away at the property status of dogs before moving on to other animals you know ending testing against dogs and you know medical testing um or Chemical Testing um on dogs and then expanding to other animals who are tested on um including animals who are usually farmed for food like pigs um so this kind of expansion from Animal Companions to other animals um also feels very promising to us next and then finally um can we find a right or a simple right um that furthers,36
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,38:34,our narrative and our political strategy akin to you know freedom to the you know freedom to marry so what we've learned from the freedom to marry movement is that if Ian Wolfson chose marriage equality um because it would be an engine of transformation to catalyze the conversations the narrative shift um around love and commitment and to show people the similarity of gay people and um their relationship ship um to heterosexual love and by changing the way that straight people saw gay people this would open up opportunities for further civil rights so you know could this be an opportunity for us to find a right or a protection that might not be the most important right or protection instrumentally but symbolically would catalyze conversations and really get people to change the way that they see and relate to other animals as sentient individuals like us and so open up opportunities for further you know more fundamental rights um so one that we've been thinking about is reframing uh,37

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,40:43,opportunities and risks and campaign ideas and narrative shifts that are needed um and then each of these Pathways have surfaced a range of grand objectives things that we that we might want to achieve um through these Pathways in the next next 40 years and they've also surfaced um many different options for strategic Milestones so there's Milestones along the way to Grand objective next so um you know there are potential Grand objectives like political representation um know uh establishing membership rights for Animals as co-citizens as one example next fundamental rights to you know can we can a grand objective be you know the right to life could it be that simple for all animals or just going for dogs and cats first and then to other animals um next abolishing property status for all animals could be another grand objective next um Banning institutionalized cruelty within major sectors so farming entertainment pets um animal testing and then a sort of sub,39
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,41:46,one of that could be ban factory farming which you know many of much of the movement is focused on currently next and there are so many um possible strategic m stones that we could use to achieve these Grand objectives so i' I've put a bunch down here but this is just a a very small handful so an animal protection commission established that would be for political representation um Animal Companions recognized as co-citizens um an Overton window Milestone shift so like um 60% of the public see farmed animals the way that they see Animal Companions you know trying to break down those categories um the right to play or the freedom to play as we've talked about um the property status of animal compan I abolished um next um Banning torture unethical treatment and confinement including mutilations um open rescue recognized as a legitimate practice to rescue animals in distress or could it even be that we go for the right to rescue like they're doing in the US um Banning factory farming existing welfare laws enforced a,40
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,42:47,very boring one but potentially you know a very important one in terms of um you know disrupting and and increasing costs in the system and then you know the unnecessary suffering Clause dropped or amended which we talked about earlier so there's there's so many strategic Milestones um that we could go for um next um so how do we make sense of this well our plan is to develop strategy maps for each of the key ground objectives through collaboration with movement stakeholders and these Maps would represent the possibilities of how to achieve different ground objectives and you know they're not prescriptive um and by doing that we can then then assess the viability of different ideas and hopefully then review the different maps that are all you know leading to different Grand objectives and identify key areas or nodes that we can leverage that can then push multiple Pathways and our narrative forward um,41
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,43:45,next so what do these Maps look like I don't expect anybody to be able to read this I just wanted to show you you know an example of some of the maps that we've created um and this is one potential map for achieving fundament Al rights for animals um with sort of the the text in red these are the milestones and then in purple these are kind of focus areas um and then the arrows represent you know a contributes to b or a makes B more likely next um and this is the more detailed version and I think there's an even more detailed version so it's a bit complicated um but really it's just a way to summarize and and kind of uh yeah summarize and play with a you know some of these insights and ideas that have come up through our consultations um we've also uh tried to put our legal analysis into a high level sort of uh legal map that shows the various legal strategies and POS possibilities to get get us to fundamental rights um so both This legal,42
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,44:49,map and the more campaigning narrative shift Focus map which you know we we've um we've put together that I showed that we showed before um you know these can be happening in Tandem and working in Synergy uh and I don't have time to go into it now but if it's of Interest or if you're a legal expert and you want to have a look uh and give us feedback on on this map or any of the maps that we're producing um please do get in in touch um and our plan is that you know both of these Maps will be shared more widely soon to get feedback and to be further developed next and even though we've done loads of research you know it feels like we've just surfaced a whole load of new question questions um and yeah we're really left with a lot of questions um even though we've we feel that we've developed a much richer understanding of the opportunities and the criteria that we' need to decide on the opportunities to follow so here is you know some of the questions you know what are the popul sub issues we could polarize around to shift the narrative um if we were to take a more abolitionist approach what industry or practice is the most vulnerable to go for first um,43
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,45:56,you know do we need political representation before we can get to meaningful change in the law uh can welfare rights these simple rights can they really lead to fundamental rights um next um if we start with dogs how do we transition you know the movement or people who who we've mobilized to also campaign about farmed animals and you know what is our equivalent to the freedom to marry what is that for our movement does such a thing exist um and then I think something that's you know become very important to me recently to understand is like how do we amplify and accelerate what's already changing what's already alive um so for example uh you know in the UK breeding dog dogs for animal testing has been um you know the campaign in the Grassroots for decades and it's still and you know with Camp beagle and and uh campaigns that are currently happening in the Grassroots that's where a lot of the energy is can we help to amplify and accelerate that um another one that I,44
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,46:55,think is really potent right now in the UK is you know the opportunity to disrupt the Humane myth with you know the opportunity that groups like animal Rising animal Justice project and all of the Nos and groups that have done so many investigations over the last 16 years um showing that this you know Humane farms High welfare farms and you know this is a bit this is a myth you know I think you know this is one of the strongest and most harmful narratives that's holding us back from moving away from animal farming so is this something we should be amplifying and accelerating so these are you know all questions for us um so what are our next steps well we want to develop in crowdsource maps in collaboration with others uh we want to be able to then identify the key nodes and Milestones and issues that these kind of these Maps um emerge from these Maps into looking at all of the maps together and then we'll want to do some focus groups to test the campaign ideas,45
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,47:54,and the issue ideas that come out of doing that analysis of these Maps um and again you know so much of this process has been consultation and so we want to continue integrating feedback from others uh and then we're going to have to make some choices and then the hope is that we can share a high level plan at the end of this year next um I would really I know I've drawn a lot on a few resources like we have to take also just to say that we have to take all of these take the good things from all of them and you know leave the things that don't really apply you know good strategy bad strategy which is a great book but you know it's about uh organizational strategy not movement strategy um but it's it's a really good sort of conceptual book I think um and then practical radicals I really enjoyed this book and I think uh the framing of the you know these seven different strategies and how you know all of them are needed and it just really depends on your power and on and on the context I think is a really good framing really really good books both of them I would,46

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,52:21,able to unmute yeah thank you so much this I really enjoyed this um this talk is really inspiring and hopeful um I have like a few questions so maybe I'll just like focus on one first um I don't know which one to pick okay so I'm from the US and so the word polarized Society like scares me but I think you have a particular meaning by that so can you like tell me what you mean um yeah I really the idea of finding a strategy that like everyone agrees with and also would destroy the industry like I'm all here for but I just yeah can you expl yeah yeah no I I realize it's quite a loaded word we we you know the UK is also polarized um not as much as the US um but yeah it's the idea that in order to really um shift that kind of movable middle we need to um pick campaigns or issues that can really push you know the conflict out into the public Consciousness um and ask,50
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,53:24,people to pick aide and um and really we want to positively polarize so move more people towards us and and then push a very few people you know away from us that could really highlight okay we don't want to be that we want to be this um that's a very uh sort of simple thing but I really yeah really understand that um polarizing in in polarized societies is scary um and it's just it's kind of a technique to try and um yeah move that that that sort of P persuadable middle to to pick a side and to move towards towards us yeah yeah just to chip in I think like freedom to marry is a really great example because obviously they were voting on this and they knew either people were going to vote Yes or no and it's like they wanted to bring as many people as they could and they did it in a way where they kind of had to polarize people but in a way that would never shame people that were voting now and I,51
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,54:21,was always framing as you know everyone wins if we vote Yes you know America wins love wins so it's a way you can still polarize but do it in a way that doesn't kind of Shame and really divide people I think um I think Alex you've got a question hopefully you should be able to yeah I'm great talk thank you as always um rspca assured is very quiet the last few weeks so with the current animal Rising campaign exposing their endorsement of factory farming what do you think might happen next looking at other movements where we put people on the spot and building on that um K starm as a young Barrister was helping the M liable support campaign and beat the British government in the European Court of Human Rights gotten 57 Grand compensation because they were denied legal aid and stuff um so we've got a new government on Friday and you mentioned um seizing opportunities um so thinking of rspca,52
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,55:25,assured or anything else new government what what do we do next week what do well I don't know about what we do next week but I just speak to the rspca show you know you're asking what happens next honestly I think what happens next depends on us as a movement like can we actually take advantage of the opportunity of you know that not just animal Rising animal Justice project is also running a camp running campaigns and all of the investigations that have happened over the last 16 years like I think um we as a movement and especially in the UK at the moment we need to we need to get organized and figure out a way to really keep the pressure up because I'm not quite seeing at the moment I know that things are happening bubbling away but we really need to keep the pressure up and to really escalate um so that the rspca is forced to respond um adequately rather than you know the usual stock response of oh we will look into this um and I I think yeah I I think that's that's what I mean what I'm worried about is that this could come and go if,53
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,56:32,we don't do something to respond to the opportunity um so there's lots that people can be doing Grassroots you know the leafleting the stickering they you know uh doing Outreach outside of rspca shops and shelters um I know that you know there are inside game groups who are having discussions there are outside game groups having discussions about what we can do so so um I would say watch this space um and in terms of the the next government yeah I was thinking about this as well and I was thinking about um in particular I was thinking about animal testing um and you know I think I don't know if Tom Harris is on this call but I've had lots of really good um uh conversations with him and I think there really is an opportunity if we can focus in the UK around um the animal testing piece in labor Manifesto they're already talk they're talking about a road map to phasing out animal testing so I think yeah we need to be thinking exactly as you're saying Alex what are the opportunities and I know some of the ngos have got cracked down on cruelty um,54
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,57:38,campaigns to really try and um get stuff uh you know get politicians to be saying what are they going to do about these animal issues so hopefully labor does get in for the animal sake anyway not for maybe other issues Yeah Anna you should be able to unmute hopefully ask your question um yeah I I just wanted to say thank you as well because that was um you know it's good talk but just it's uh really just reassuring and gratifying to know that people are like doing this stuff I'm thinking about this which is so um important and thinking about it in a strategic way how do we actually progress in these areas and um yeah there's so many things I could ask you about but um uh just so the the first thing that um I that struck me as an interesting area to pick out an overlap potentially between your issues that are already in the public Consciousness and these kind of sub issues that people that the public might be uh you know kind of sympathetic to,55
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,58:40,already and um these areas which I think it's really good idea thinking about what is indefensible and and indispensable so things that just can't really be modified like that you can't have that excuse of well we just need to do this a bit better it made me think about um uh milk and um uh cattle farming and I've thought about that a lot anyway because um I've just quite recently been on a trial for a protest um related to um the milk industry and we're in Crown Court and we're able to we actually had a lot of opportunity to um our judge was like very um uh sympathetic to letting us speak at length actually about not just the climate crisis and like the impact of animal farming on the environment but of um milk farming uh sorry of milk production on animals themselves and because I have done a bit of work on this in a a previous job um I I worked,56
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,59:37,on an inquiry that looked at genetic engineering techniques in farmed animals so i' done a lot of reading about um cows and so the thing that I Pi so it would have been good maybe if I'd come to this talk me to ask you this before um the trial um perhaps maybe that's why we got all got convicted but um the stuff that I decided to focus on um was um stuff around um uh two things like kind of motherhood like maternal separation about which there's a lot of evidence so I tried to sort of stress that that there's actually a lot of academic work or some academic work like looking at the impact of um mothers and calves and on their long-term development um which I think a lot of people you know it seems a bit strange but I think it is true that PE people might be happy to eat the Flesh of an animal that has been killed very prematur early but they hate the idea that like a mother and a a child might have been separated in order to do that and I could sort of see that on the faces of like the jurors um as I talked,57
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DwLGBwX2sk,Where Vision Meets Strategy: Crafting our 40-year Roadmap to Animal Freedom in the UK,Animal Think Tank,4 Jul 2024,1:00:38,about that alongside things around like artificial SE insemination things that are just absolutely built into that you I don't think it's plausible I mean I might be wrong but I I see that as just something that is just you just can't produce milk on a mascar without that and the other thing that I talked about was um linking in with this question of like animals as individuals it's work that's been done on um like personality and and and differences so not just kind of um sentience or some work on animals seems to be around you know what kinds of things do cows do what kinds of things are dogs capable of I find it quite interesting and um I I I think I observe in people that I talk to about it as like potentially affecting animals of the same species are different from one another they have different different kind of personality and this is something that anyone that has a companion animal kind of knows about cats and dogs anyway they're like very very different from one another um again it's it's a hunch because I don't really know but that's from the all the times I've spoken to people that are not part,58

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,7:43,didn't reply at all or they pointed the finger at another entity and they said oh you know go to the cdfa that's not us and the cdfa says oh that you know you need to go to the local police about that and the district attorney says something else so no one it's a game of hot potato nobody wants to have the potato which is actually doing something about rampant animal cruelty that they all know exists but because it's so normalized in the industry it's a really big problem for them to take on and they're not willing to do it so we've been trying to take it on ourselves as a rag ragtag team of Grassroots activists and we've been able to pull off some amazing things honestly one of the things that I'm most proud about in the short 10 years we've been around is just being able to bring open rescue more front and center in the movement um we definitely did not invent open rescue as a tactic but we're trying to bring it into the public conversation more and,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,8:41,also in the movement elevate it more and so in 2018 and 2019 after many months reporting and um calling and showing up in person and and emailing every way that we could contacting these people with power and they didn't do anything about Criminal animal cruelty we took action ourselves during the animal Liberation conference in 2018 and 2019 and those actions happened at Sunrise Farms which I mentioned where Ching was rescued and at reichart Duck Farm which is California's largest duck farm in um also in Petaluma in Sonoma County they're actually really close to each other there's you know these factory farms are concentrated in a small area and over 100 people were arrested on felony charges across a few of these actions in Soma County just for taking non-violent direct action holding flowers holding peace signs trying to help suffering animals and that was like I said 2018 2019 this case really dragged on for a long time covid was part of that but also having multiple defendants um and multiple lawyers made,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,9:48,scheduling a nightmare and things just kept getting delayed and delayed it was probably a stalling tactic partly from the industry to keep charges pending over people because ultimately on the first day of trial they dropped all my charges after 5 years facing charges so um I think in my case that was definitely part of it um but ultimately the only defendant who was remaining after some charges were dropped and some people took plea deals was Wayne and that trial started in September we thought it would end in September it lasted until November it was an 8-week trial with six days of jury deliberation and on November 2nd last month after six days of jury deliberation the jury found Wayne on three of the four charges they hung on the fourth charge which is good and a sign that there was some confusion uh about you know what exactly the well they had a lot of questions for the judge about what exactly the law was and how to interpret the mistake of law defense you know if someone thought what they were doing was legal that can be a,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,10:50,defense to them breaking a law but then we've spoken with one juror since who was saying how can you know what someone really believed it's so hard to know what someone believed and what their intentions were and that's true it it's very hard to know juries have a lot of power to interpret things how they want to but ultimately they found Wayne guilty on two counts of misdemeanor trespass and the felony conspiracy charge at Sunrise Farms where he was definitely the lead person leading the action and he testified openly about that and he was taken immediately to jail which was a little bit surprising but I think probably what Wayne would want if he's going to go to jail do it right away tell the let everyone know um so he was remanded into custody right away and he had his sentencing hearing four weeks later on November 30th and he was sentenced to 90 days in jail but because he'd already served 30 days basically and in California there's a halftime statute where mostly because the jails are so overcrowded and understaffed and the conditions are really bad there's just a norm of people,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,11:54,serving half their sentence unless um there's other extreme circumstances so he got out of jail on December 9th which is great but he in addition to the 90-day sentence he also got two years of probation which include various terms the worst of which by far worse even than the jail sentence is a no contact order which prohibits him from having any kind of contact in person electronic communication telling someone to tell something to that person anything direct uh with 14 people who are called his co-conspirators which is very unjust because none of those people were put on trial or convicted of being co-conspirators I'm one of them and they literally dropped my charges thinking they couldn't convict me but they can still label me a co-conspirator and now I'm one of these people that Wayne can't speak with at all for two years and Zoe is as well so because we're here on this,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,12:51,call Wayne cannot be and if Wayne were on the call we could not be so there's a lot of um coordinating going on now to to figure out how that's going to work because another person on the list is Paul Darwin picklesimer who was Wayne's codefendant in the Smithfield trial and is his codefendant in the upcoming our next right to rescue trial which is a beagle rescue case in Wisconsin scheduled for March um and so you know I think that's very intentional that the judge went out of her way to add that on it wasn't even something the prosecutor asked for because what they want is to isolate us and to make us less not just less connected but less effective they want to make us less effective because they're basically operating like the the legal arm and the pr arm of the industry of the Farm Bureau in this County and doing whatever is going to help them um like keeping us from communicating with each other but as terrible as that is and we weren't necessarily prepared for this no contact order we were definitely expecting a,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,13:52,conviction and we were aware that you know there's a lot of risk involved in going to trial in these cases we were actually expecting a conviction much earlier we we really thought it would happen in the Smithfield trial and we were so elated that we won earlier than expected and we got you know the first acquittal for open rescue in history in that case and then we followed it up five months later with another aqual for open Rescuers in the Foster Farms trial here in Merced California and you know I think Almira our lead organizer put it like this if you were writing a book about open rescue this is what would happen this was after Wayne was convicted like you wouldn't just keep winning that wouldn't be a very good book you need some tension we the third time or you know whatever after all this this winning streak like you've got to face some really big obstacles you need some plot um and obviously we're not literally writing a book but I think about what we're doing in that way a lot because we are writing history together,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,14:53,and we're trying to change the world and we know we're going to face obstacles we knew that repression was coming and we also know that if there's anywhere that we're going to face this repression where someone's going to be convicted honestly Sonoma County is probably the best place and this was the best case for that for a huge number of reasons I'm just going to really briefly gloss over that to wrap up but for one thing with all the reporting that I mentioned all the efforts that were made to contact the authorities before these actions happened we have a really strong case for necessity for the necessity defense to say we exhausted our legal options you left us with no choice we had to take action ourselves and the necessity defense has never been used for animals so far um it was not allowed in this trial but that's one of many things that Wayne is appealing on which if we can win in a court of appeal on that or any of the other number of reversible terrible errors that the judge made in this case then that would actually set case law would actually have a a binding element to it if it happens in a higher Court rather than just a single um criminal case and,15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,16:01,somoma county is a county where we have a lot of activists where we have a lot of pressure where people really care about animals um you know there's this Humane myth happening here that we're working to expose and we're able to do that effectively because people really want to help animals the county is really full of people who think that they're doing something a better way and they're shocked to find out what we've seen at these facilities here in somoma County so what we do in this County really matters and what we do in this moment really matters so I'm really looking forward to what's coming next and I'm just really grateful that everyone here is part of that by sharing amplifying supporting and being in solidarity at this time thanks amazing thank you kessie um I think that was like a quite a nice brief explanation of what happened and what you're expecting um I want to turn into Zoe and like how because she's one of the people who got arrested and like what's the,16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,17:04,consequences of it and how are you feeling what was your experience and I also want to know like was there any um um any anything that the court said like are you still can you still like because you you are the um um founder of Happy Hen Animal Sanctuary um with this um arrest um is there anything uh legal that prevents you from um contacting from or like getting in contact with an animal like is that is anything happened like that what's the consequences of it yeah thanks and thanks everybody for for joining uh yeah so I'm involved in this new case now in Sonoma County so you know kind of doing it all over again and it's also very comp licated case and uh they're you know really going hard after us so far uh kind of treating us as dangerous criminals and actually you,17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,18:09,know these charges stem from events that took place uh some of them even a few months before Wayne's trial so uh this past spring uh we did a investigation of Petaluma poultry as so Petaluma is a town in Sonoma County and Petaluma poultry is trying to paint itself as this local business U but if you do a quick Google search you can see that Petaluma ptry is owned by Purdue which is one of the largest um agriculture companies in the US um and Purdue's big thing is like no antibiotics ever that's you know they put that on all their packaging and really tout that and push that and try to make themselves sound better than all of the other chicken companies and the dark reality that we kind of uncovered throughout this investigation this past spring is that no antibiotics ever really just means sick diseased Birds aren't getting Medical Care and they're just left to die and waste away on the floor of these Farms so during this investigation of of the factory farms um we found two really,18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,19:17,"really sick chickens who we've named Vincent and petunia uh petunia was actually on her back uh she was in really bad shape she had a bloody wing um you know I remember saying to one of my the other investigators you know we we can rescue her but I don't I don't think she's going to survive um and somehow she did pull through and and Vincent pulled through too he was also really sick he couldn't even stand up and he had a fever um and it cost over $5,000 or maybe even over $6,000 in Veterinary bills to save them they were in the hospital for several days and the one of the most concerning things was that Vincent actually tested positive for multi-drug resistant entro caucus bacteria which is a zoonotic bacteria it's incredibly dangerous especially um because it was resistant to so many bacterias so that means that if somebody had eaten his body if he had gone um through the slaughter process and ended up on somebody's plate um you know Not only would his life have been harmed but also somebody who ate him could have gotten really really sick too and",19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,20:24,especially if they were amuno compromised they also could have died um so that was really concerning their slaughter house the pedala poultry slaughterous has also fa a lot of criticism for Campo baor and eoli bacterias and just a lot of public health concerns and we also um did an investigation of the slaughterous which found additional concerns such as evidence that chickens were being regularly boiled alive so we reported all of those findings to law enforcement uh and tried to get them to do something to act themselves they didn't so uh on June 13th the early hours of June 13th me and a few other investigators disguised ourselves as workers and we entered the Petaluma poultry slaughter house and We rescued four chickens off of uh a transport truck uh in the holding area of the slaughterous and got them Veterinary Care uh that night the police did not respond in any substantive way they didn't do anything to help the animals they didn't do anything to stop us and we you know all the rescues that night were successful,20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,21:31,and didn't um involve any confrontations with law enforcement so then fast forward a few months it's Wayne's trial um and during Wayne's trial we started to investigate reart Duck Farm again for the first time since 2019 uh so one of the facilities Wayne was obviously facing charges for was reikart um and yeah so back in 2019 when we investigated right cart the first time we found horrible diseases there including Rella and adap pester bacteria which causes ducks to fall on their backs unable to write themselves and slowly die of starvation and dehydration uh among so many other just horrible horrible cruelties and when I was approaching reart in 2023 I was thinking you know it won't be the same there's no way that it's you know still as bad as it was all the way back then unfortunately it was just as bad and uh just absolutely horrible horrible cruelty,21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,22:33,probably you know I've investigated over a dozen factory farms and slaughter houses and I think um right cart duck farm by far is probably the worst facility I have ever seen um just so much rampant animal cruelty uh so we reported that cruelty we actually ended up rescuing two birds who were on the brink of death um I still just cannot believe that they survived their names River in Oakley and they're still on pain meds and antibiotics but they're doing so so much better and um after Wayne's sentence uh you know we' kind of gotten a light commitment from the district attorney's office that once Wayne's trial was over they would meet with us about the animal cruelty which is ridiculous they should have met with us you know before Wayne's trial was over but they kind of had lightly committed to um meeting with us so our plan was all right after Wayne's trial is over we'll release this and ask them to meet with us about it and report this,22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,23:33,again um and maybe they'll maybe they'll do something um this time and so Wayne sentence comes down it's obviously a guilty verdict and that's kind of I think when it hit all of us like okay what we're about to release which shows you know our faces this could be to you know real consequences somebody's just been sent to Jail uh and so all the risks of what we were doing no longer felt hyp hypothetical it felt very real but I wrote this in a blog I I wrote recently um but you know a part of me was thinking like is this really a good idea but you know you have to remind yourself in those moments like nothing the legal system can do to any of us will ever compare to what these animals go through not even a little bit um which is why we have to do this and we have to um be willing to face this um so we released the new investigation and rescue and also um there's another investigation at rescue at another facility involved in the trial that was released at that point as well um and we tried to go to the district attorney's office and they actually shut the door,23
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,24:35,on our faces wouldn't even accept the letter um with all of the reports so yeah we weren't able to meet with them at all we went to the Sheriff's Office reported things there um they didn't do anything just I've probably reported this cruelty at reart now over 30 times to different agencies since since we released this investigation and nobody's done anything um what they did do instead was after Wayne's sentencing hearing um while I was actually leading everybody to go report the cruelty again at the sheriff's office um I myself and um two others were arrested and a sheriff's officer started walking towards me basically as we were um enter about to enter the sheriff's office I had a full report I had letters from veterinarians about why you know immediate action was needed and a sheriff's officer shouts Miss Rosenberg and I I was actually kind of excited because I was like wow they're coming to me for the report like they are going to come accept this report and,24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,25:39,so you know I was about to open my mouth and kind of explain everything I had and hand him the folder and and then he just said we have a warrant for your arrest and I was like oh okay all right um so I was arrested and then my friend Rocky chow and Conrad Deus who are other investigators in DXE also got arrested and they were each arrested on one felony and two misdemeanors um kind of trespassing conspiracy type charges um and they're saying that that they were both seen on a security camera investigating a factory farm recently I was arrested on seven felonies and six misdemeanor and I'm potentially facing over 20 years in prison um of those seven felonies two are related to um reichart and facing burglary charges so we believe for the rescue of river and Oakley and the rest of the felonies are related to Petaluma poultry um so of the charges I was arrested on so far I have five so only the ones related to Petaluma ptery have been,25
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,26:50,filed so five felonies and three misdemeanors have been filed by the court by the district attorney's office that does not mean that the other felon and misdemeanors won't be charged or filed so I could potentially face you know all seven felonies and six misdemeanor um it's possible to file even more charges or it's possible they won't file all of them it's really hard to say at this point so far Rocky and Conrad's charges haven't been filed um and then we also found out that Lewis Bernier another investigator in dxc also had a warrant out for their arrest so uh because Lewis found out you you know not by getting just randomly arrested but by looking at the court database um L was able to go and turn thems in so instead of having to you know go through the whole arrest process and spending you know time in jail leis was able to just immediately go and go before a judge and um go home basically um so that was really good I mean it's terrible that they're also facing charges but glad that they didn't have to deal with all,26
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,27:54,of that um and I I believe Lewis is also at this point probably facing one felony and maybe two misdemeanors but it's unclear and and again once they file those charges if they do we'll have more clarity but maybe they won't file them we'll see um so yeah this past Thursday I had to go to court we all had to go to court um for an arraignment hearing where what we thought was going to be an arraignment hearing uh where basically we were expecting they would just read out the charges for us and maybe we would ple guilty or ple not guilty um which is basically you know do you yeah do you want to just admit that you did it and have this be over and get your punishment or try to fight this um so Rocky and Conrad they didn't have anything consequential happened during their hearing um they just said we haven't decided yet if we're going to file the charges we want we're still investigating the crime we want them to come back on February 29th so Rocky and,27
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,28:58,Conrad will be going back to court then and hopefully the da at that point will kind of have more answers on what they're planning to do the district attorney um for Lewis's hearing pretty much the same thing happened um they just you know said your warrant is cleared and come on the 29th U my hearing ended up being not at all what we expected um I did not plead guilty or not guilty but the District Attorney's office um requested that I be put on what they call pre-trial release so previously I was out on bail um you can also be out on your own recognizance um and both of those don't you know usually involve terms like there's not you know you're out with these restrictions uh but they want me they wanted to put me on pre-trial release so essentially you know she's out of custody she's not in jail but she has to follow all of these restrictions and one of the restrictions that they asked for included a GPS ankle monitor um tracking and letting them know everywhere I go um and a long list,28
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,30:01,of other conditions uh the judge it was disappointing basically kind of almost treated me like I'd already been found guilty and believed everything the District Attorney's office told her and they were telling um the judge all types of like bizarre baseless things they were bringing up accusations of things I'm not even being charged for which really is not something they should really be able to do um or at least you know a judge shouldn't take that seriously if I'm not being charged um for example they were saying I've been going to factory farms uh after factory farm after factory farm over the last few weeks spreading diseases intentionally bringing bacterias to Farms to infect animals and of course that's not true and also I'm not being charged for that because they know that's not true but the judge acted like everything they were saying was true and then this threat to Public Health and to Public Safety so um the main restrictions that I've been given on my pre-trial release terms are I have to wear a GPS ankle monitor at all times um,29
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,31:01,that's on my ankle um and one of the most bizarre things is I am not allowed to possess ducks chickens or other birds which I think is very silly uh you know that's definitely something they usually bar dangerous criminals from possessing is is birds and they did make an exception for Happy Hen Animal Sanctuary which is the animal rescue I run but if you know I wanted to personally outside of the my rescue organization if I wanted to personally like Foster a chicken um or something I would not be allowed to do that um I can't leave the county I reside in that's Alam County I can't leave um the county without telling the probation office first I can't leave the state of California without explicit permission from the court I have to report to the probation office two times a month I'm subject to warrantless searches and seizures so that means that without getting a warrant from a judge uh law enforcement at any time can raid my uh residents and go through all my,30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,32:10,belongings take anything they want they can also you know stop me my just myself at any point if I'm just walking down the street they can search my person and take anything they want um I can't go on any properties where animals are being raised for meat dairy or eggs and I have to stay a 100 yards away from Petaluma poultry reart dock farm and sunrise farms and if I violate any of these conditions then my pre-trial release terms I mean because it's pre-trial release then essentially they could hold me until trial because I violated those terms um so I would be potentially held in jail you know for maybe even a year before trial um and this Friday we are going to have an opportunity to challenge these terms um so we'll be going back and trying to argue again to the judge that I should not have to be out on pre-trial release um you know we're not expecting she's going to overturn her previous ruling but it's possible um but yeah I think this all just shows that the industry is,31
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,33:16,feeling threatened um they know how powerful we are and they know that we're making a difference and that's why they're so desperate to stop us and it's so important that we all uh rise up in the face of this repression and and if anything let it fuel us let it motivate us to continue fighting harder for the animals this is not the time to back down it's the time to to push harder thank you Zoe um yeah I was very curious about what happened to the sanctuary and thank you for explaining that um yeah I'm G to turn to Mark and uh I just wanted to mention that like if you guys have any questions please uh use the chat and we'll be answering that um in the last 15 minutes of the webinar and um yeah as I was saying um as animal think tank from the beginning we tried to support Wayne and we try to escalate the movement and um Mark is going to mention about like how we can as the movement as the animal Freedom Movement can use these moments and turn into our benefits our,32
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,34:21,advantage and yeah so Mark it's your um thanks n um yeah I'd just like to start by recognizing um Cassie and Zoe's courage um which I feel really humbled by um like particularly hearing Zoe say like she's investigated 12 factory farms which I imagine has been you know multiple occasions going in in the dead of night um you know multiple rescues you know which all which takes a lot courage um and then facing you know this particular trial and you know 20 years um potentially sentencing and that's yeah that I mean that's pretty amazing you and you're just there as if this is you know some normal act that you do every day I mean it is a normal act that you do every day but um not the rest of us so yeah I just want to yeah acknowledge that and say say thanks on behalf of all of us in the movement and and also on behalf of of the,33
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,35:18,animals um so yeah I want to pick up on what Zoe sort of concluded on that um these moments can be an opportunity for all of us uh in the movement as individuals um and as organizations and even uniting as a movement and showing our strength and uh when repression comes in the form of arrests and heavy sentencing you know you can give up um but I think it's it's like history has shown that this is the moment to ramp up um and for more of us to get involved I'm just going to take us through a few um of the sort of dynamics of um social movements of like what academics have kind of understood how we can win in moments like this um and I'm talking so I'm going to be talking about things called like the a whirlwind moment so a whirlwind moment is like you know you're operating as a movement and then something happens and,34
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,36:17,you kind of got like a a whirlwind going on it's like you sometimes you don't know where it's come from um and you sort of grabbed the Public's attention um you have maybe press attention um and you can do something with that and you can try and you know keep that momentum going and those moments can be um created like in these scenarios where you do an open rescue with the expectation um of being arrested um and that might drive a whirlwind or the court case might drive a whirlwind or um the sentencing might drive drive a whirlwind um but they can also be accidental um so things like um Esther the Wonder Pig I guess was you know an accident that then we were able to leverage as a movement so what's what's important in in these moments is that we're ready for them as organizations um and then as individuals and as organizations we're kind of ready to join in and do our make our contribution uh and support you know the people who are at the at the [Music],35
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,37:21,center um and just to say like sometimes these moments sort of you know us in in the making um and often it might be an organization that's kind of being quite quiet in the background and invisible and then suddenly something happens um so you know often moments like the me too movement or black lives matter or Extinction Rebellion or occupy like the hit our screens and you know the media social media but actually sometimes there's been you know a group of you know committed people working for years to make that maybe make the moment happen but C ly like capture that moment and then drive it in the Public's imagination um so two dynamics that can sort of happen or we might be able to leverage um in open rescue over the next years or decades or maybe in this particular case um one is uh something called escalation so it's a sort of particular form uh of Whirlwind um so you might have just a,36
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,38:21,small trigger event um like uh an arrest um or a sentencing and it can be driven by us or it could be driven by the authorities and the idea is to like escalate from an initial moment to make it something much bigger and I think key to this is knowing the dynamic and understanding it as a movement and as individuals and then working with it so that's why we as animal I think tank we kind of interested in in tonight is trying to help um bring these Dynamics um to be be more widely understood um so we can participate in them um so Nashville is often like referred to as the textbook um sort of escalation moment uh one that I sort of know to an extent um so Nashville is um one of the the towns or cities um where the lunch lunch counter sittings uh took place during the Civil Rights Movement so they had a campaign demand wishes to desegregate the lunch counters in,37
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,39:31,Nashville and this was part of a wider National um movement or Milestone that they're trying to achieve which was to desegregate um the US generally um under a sort of a much bigger Grand objective of equal rights um for black people so a particular Dynamic with with the lunch counter or how the Lunch Counter sort of uh played out the escalation um so the lunch counter sittings at the time were not particularly popular with um black activists or with the black um population generally and certainly not the the white population so at the beginning a fairly limited number of people who were willing to participate in the lunch counter sittings in Nashville so there was limited number of activists and there was limited public support and then you had arrest taking place and violence um against the activists from the white Community um so this is a form of repression so it wasn't necessarily the authorities or the police were also involved in violence and what this did is like the,38
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,40:39,the community didn't give up in that moment and back away um it actually drove them to escalate so more people were willing to be activists and join in the the lunch toown the the counter sitting lunch counter sittings I would really struggle with that as a collection of words um so that that sort of continued um sort of I guess like what we might see is like more open rescues um and then people were being arrested they were being tried and what you had was vigils and demos outside the police stations with people you know um being held um outside the courts and outside the jails so this increase uh increases the number of people who can get involved um in a moment so like you there's a limited number of people who do the the counter sit in but there much bigger pool of people who are willing to you know be involved in a um a demonstration outside a courtroom and as more people were getting arrested and as the senten was quite heavy heavy then this Drew uh sort,39
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,41:45,of more support uh in The Wider community and black population in that area um and what um they decided to do um was to boycott the shops uh downtown sort of WID a widespread boycott and to picket some of those those shops and um counters and so at this stage I can't remember but you know a large po large segment of the population now started to get involved so more and more people are involved so this is kind of you know part of the escalation um and then one of the uh lawyers who was representing um some of the activists his house was bombed and again rather than that you know pressing the community and frightening them and backing off like more of the community got involved and that led to a March of like a huge part of the of the population on the downtown um and got the mayor to concede and to accept that they would desegregate um the counters uh in,40
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,42:48,Nashville so you're going from a small pool of people and it's essentially it's the repression is driving then the sense of Injustice in the population that they are sort of willing to get involved to get a lot more people involved um and what happened in that particular case as well is like a lot of um fundraising became a lot easier so uh support for the activists for their um for legal cases housing and everything that also sort of increased so you could say that the success of the that particular moment was due to the boycott and the marches where you had like a large proportion of the population involved but they only really happened because of the initial sittings um that sort of drove the community to respond in that way so when we have um scenarios like um Zoe's case then this could be um an opportunity to drive escalation and it could be one of those uh situations that you know grab public attention become a Whirlwind um so we can't ever really,41
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,43:59,know that like it's you know it's partly to do with fate about you know what journalist is you know got what press release on their desk on any particular day um what conversations are happening what what else isn't happening so like often we celebrate sort of certain historic moments as like oh that was like a Cornerstone in turning things around um but maybe there were dozens if not hundreds of actions that were you know just exactly the same but didn't lead to kind of those escalation moments so part of this as a movement is like we have to be ready and we have to be you know agile in responding and we have to like as individuals get involved when these things happen but we also have to have perseverance and you know we might try to escalate Zoe's case and if it doesn't happen it's just like well we'll have to escalate Zoe's next case or the or the one after and it might be dozens or you know maybe even hundreds of um trials and sentencing um before we you know we really grabbed the Public's imagination so this is one of the like the the keys,42
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,45:05,I think to um social movements being successful is just like a lot of determination and persever perseverance and like not getting lots of hits um and then eventually yeah you do get one um there was another Dynamic that happened um in Nashville um which is called the backfire effect um and this is when the public swing to support you not because they believe in you being right or not because they're persuaded that you're rational and you've got the right cause um but they're persuaded because of the violence against you and they see that that how you're being treated either by the police or by other members of the public is unjust and unfair um and so they sort of come to your side um out of a sense of support and and Injustice towards you as the activist rather than necessarily supporting the movement that you're behind so this is a really common Dynamic um it was one I,43
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,46:10,witnessed here in um Lancaster I'm based in the UK north of England um and you know quite some time ago we didn't have fracking in the UK and then the Government tried to introduce fracking um and in those early days the sort of the NOS or the nonprofits were able to drive a sort a small amount of press around this you kind of shock horror you know we're not going to have fracking this is what's done in the US and in other countries um and was you know there's a big sort of um big push from the environmental movement but fairly quickly the Press interest and the public interest dropped and there was kind of there was like no press for for a long time um um and then there was um a lot of there was a few sites were chosen for sort of experimentation and there was a lot of public protest there and there was kind of no press and you know this the public um the number of people involved in the process you grew particularly here in Lancaster I was very aware of it you,44
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,47:16,know hundreds every day four years and there was direct action taking place um so you know breaking some of the equipment that was going in no press um there was a blockading entrances for days into the sites no press um there was a really successful action where uh we got the main road huage company that was supplying the sites so the biggest the biggest kind of uh truck um company in the UK after two days of action against them soort of blocking their sites so they couldn't get in or out with their trucks they decided not to um Supply any fracking sites uh in the UK no press um and then three guys um stood on top of three trucks outside the entrance to one of the fracking sites um and blocked the road for I think it was three days and it was like virtually no press it just made the local press um they were arrested uh after three days um they were tried no press um and then,45
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,48:23,they were sentenced um I can't remember like a week two weeks later um and they got between three and a half and 5 months U jail sentences which in the UK for that type of action was quite high and suddenly it was front page of every single newspaper in the UK for three days um I was on TV and so this was a backfire effect it's like finally um the the press and the public had shown interest and what was H what was happening was that it was a sense of Injustice and the shock shock that they were getting three and a half to 5 months in jail for just standing peacefully on the top of a truck um so that's what swung um press interest um swung sort of popular interest and Ian I feel that you can see the decline in support for the fracker movement from that moment and it was about sort of a year and a half later where there was a moratorium called on fracking in the UK so this is exact the you know the,46
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,49:26,type of thing that um open rescue is is trying to do so it is yes rescuing animals but it was also driving a public debate um by generating these sort of Dynamics and I think you know why I'm interested and why I'm on this call is like we have to understand our role as individuals and as other organizations to respond to these moments and to support organizations like DXE and activists like Zoe and Cassie um to drive that escalation by being there um outside the courtrooms outside the jails outside the police stations uh and participating in the way that we can um and for some of us that might be you know doing the direct actions doing the open rescues on the days that they're they're in court um in a conversation I had um a few months ago with Paul Engler who's kind of one of the sort of main contemporary social mement theorists and has sort of advised and supported like you know most of the movements in the US like black lives matter um and he he was,47
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,50:33,saying that the biggest failure of contemporary movements is the fear to escalate and so it's the fear to support um people uh like Zoe in these moments um and I guess what's Central to that is our fear of sacrificing like you know Zoe and Cassie really put themselves on the line you know potentially facing long terms in jail um and for some of us you know just being outside a courtroom for a few days might be sacrificing holiday or um being in the wet or like having our friends or family like criticize us or you know potentially being fearful that we could get caught up in a protest but sacrifice um is another important sort of element of of the journey that we're all involved in so yeah I'd really like to celebrate again like Zoe and Cassie's willingness to to sacrifice themselves thank you thank you Mark um so I'll will be taking some questions we,48
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,51:35,have like six minutes left um but um I just wanted to mention that Cassi zo or Mark like you can answer the questions if you like on chat so that um they won't be left unanswered uh I will take the first I will read the first question is there a way we can bring public um attention to the supicious argument of biocurity behind AAG laws that seek to penalize whistleblowers who reveal animal abuses uh the reason this could Garner support not only from self-professed animal lovers but from people who care exclusively about human health yeah I mean I think it's important to know that the claims that the industry makes about being concerned about biocurity aren't fake there's a huge biocurity risk present at every factory farm which is why you know they enforce certain biocurity protocols including workers aren't workers at chicken farms aren't supposed to you know um be around other birds right before they're coming to work that week before or whatever um so I think the,49
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,52:42,best way we can get our narrative out about that is to express how serious it is and to show how seriously we take biocurity and how we actually take it more seriously not just because we're not operating factory farms that are Petri dishes of disease but because when we are investigating them we practice Veterinary approved highest standard biocurity protocols everyone's showered and sanitized and wearing TYC suits and gloves and hair nets and sanitized any gear that's coming into the facility um you know so we definitely don't want to like downplay how important that is but show in fact how the industry is clearly not taking it that seriously when um we have many documented violations of biocurity protocols including at facility like reart Duck Farm um and others in Sona County thank you um I'm gonna move to the next question um so this question is from Becky uh it's a legal strategy question um to,50
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,53:45,what degree is the strategy of these right rescue cases actually legal Change setting president and um versus starting a conversation on the public stage putting in another way is to focus more on legal change or social cultural cultural change or media that's a great question it's definitely both and I think that that is part of what makes the campaign a little confusing in addition to all the legal jargon and everything else um but it's definitely about social change even you know win or lose in these cases we feel that we're winning in the courts of public opinion if we can get people talking about what animals deserve what specific animals deserve what Lily and Lizzy deserved when they were starving to death on the floor of a Smithfield factory farm and to get even the prosecutors in that case referring to them as Lily the Piglet and Lizzie the piglet you know maybe just from convenience to say who they were referencing but also because we changed the dynamic in the courtroom to be about individual animals um so I think that yeah like I think Mark said that we're,51
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,54:47,trying to put the factory farms on trial and we're just there as a a proxy for these animals to try to get Justice for them against the factory farms and even though it's really the other way according to the court that's how we're perceiving of these cases um very much it's about putting the industry on trial in front of the public and generating attention and social change but uh more of an end goal that we hope to reach and may take a long time is to actually change the law in in a higher court or you know the right to rescue could be enshrined without the courts as well if there's enough fuel coming from these court cases it could be enshrined through a legislative bill there's already a bill in California that was passed a few years ago that's called the right to rescue act which is part of our inspiration for the name and it's specifically giving people the right to break Windows of cars on hot days to rescue dogs from overheating inside um so it's very narrow but we are talking to legislators in California about expanding that law so who knows which,52
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,55:49,way the campaign will win um but that is a big they're both parts of it thank you um I would like to get Jake's question is quite an interesting one um Jake says I also like to know how much research conversation partnership Etc has gone into learning from past open rescues campaigns and activists in the US they have gone here through a variety of waves since the 1980s but most of them ended with fell on the charges and then the campaigns fizzled out was the plan to avoid that eventually if the key organiz organizers and activists are all charged with felonies and come and stay away orders from farms and each other it kind of makes mov crumble yeah that's a really good question and I think you know the biggest fear when we are facing repression is obviously well what if it works what if they're successful what if they do break us and we have seen that happen in the past and I think it's really important that we all come together to make sure that that doesn't happen that the opposite happens that we come out of this stronger and it's up to,53
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,56:56,all of us um to determine how this goes and whether it um their efforts win um or if our efforts win um I think like the main things that we want to do um to kind of prevent repression from from succeeding is one like really training people developing new people so that you know if I am in prison it doesn't matter there's other investigators and Rescuers ready to step up there's somebody else who's going to run DXE social media I don't have to do it um and so on so we really need to develop new people um and we've so far seen our community has really stepped up in the face of this repression it's been incredible to see honestly uh I would say in light of Wayne's incarceration our community has been more mobilized than it has been since before covid so that's been incredible um we had you know about 200 people come to Wayne sentencing hearing uh and I think another really important thing is that we want to uh really get as much media attention on this as we possibly can you know get in the New York Times shoot big and show them that,54
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,57:59,we're not afraid that we're not going to back down and if we can kind of send this clear message of of strength and that what they're doing isn't working I think that'll Inspire other people um to feel less afraid as well and you know public pressure I think also will go a long way in in seeing these major news stories which um we've you know been able to get the arrests were covered in in Vice and and we've been pretty successful at getting major media coverage on these things so hopefully we can continue to do that yeah and if there's anyone specific that people think we should talk to it would be great to have connections made um we've talked to Adam Durand and Amber canavan who both uh serve time for open rescues in the past and um Andy stanion was at Wayne's sentencing hearing and that was great because you know he served a really long time in prison and he was saying that it was a positive inspirational event to see people being so motivated in the face of a sing um but yeah we have a lot of people to look to so if anyone has connections that would be,55
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8E6aNdbOM,How an Open Rescue Can Make Animal Freedom an International Debate,Animal Think Tank,4 Jan 2024,59:02,great great thank you um so we are running a bit out of time so um what I'm going to say is that the recording of this uh webinar will be shared on our YouTube channel at animal think tank so please um save these questions the ones that um we unfortunately left unanswered and sh put it as as a comment under that video that we're going to share and so that um Cassie or Zoe or Mark can answer those uh questions in detail later on um so I'll be sharing our social media account so that you can follow um when the recording is shared so thank you for everyone who joined today and thank you Cassie and Zoe and Mark um for your insightful uh thoughts and uh everyone who asked the question questions and listen to to us today um we won't be leaving the webinar so soon so um until everyone leaves so,56

Obesity is rampant and along with that we see clogged arteries, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, a host of inflammatory diseases from inflamed colon to inflamed joints, skin diseases. These are the classic diseases in western medicine seen today.",2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18FMNmCqAsU,Doctor Explains How Food Can Heal Or Assault Us,Generation Vegan,9 Dec 2019,0:58,"Obesity has become very common because we are not only eating tremendous amounts of calories, way in excess of what our bodies require, but the particular combination of sugars and fats, eaten at the same time, evokes what's called oxidative priority, we burn the sugars and store the fats for later. So when you eat something like ice cream, it is fat and sugar, we burn the sugar and store the fat. When you eat a cheeseburger, you're gonna burn the sugar",3

So we're eating that sugar/fat combination pretty much all day, from the bacon and eggs and toast in the morning, to the burgers and fries at lunch, and to the fried chicken and the milkshake in the evening. Even the broiled salmon, eaten with the grilled potatoes, is that fat and sugar combination. So the vast amounts of fat and sugar that we're eating",4

And it's more than just a cosmetic issue because as fat accumulates, especially inside the abdomen, intra-abdominal fat puts out an array of molecules that sets off inflammation, they're called inflammatory cytokines, and they set off inflammatory conditions all over the body. So obesity basically is a state of inflammation. People can say, ""Well, I'm obese, but I'm still healthy."" No, if you're obese, you're fighting inflammation",5

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qx4LHX6BAg,Ben & Roxy from So Vegan chat vegan food with Genesis Butler,Generation Vegan,1 Mar 2019,1:33,so without one day week challenge we want to just encourage people just like try it one day a week see how you get on and we know that if they embrace sort of like simple cooking and like flames and cooking and hopefully they won't see a reason kind of the scholar I'm writing a letter to the Pope to get him to go vegan for Lent for forty days he goes vegan the more people wanna go,6

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,1:07,specifically the health and and Welfare of farmed animals so this is where a lot of the information I'll be discussing comes from if by the end of this talk anyone is interested in further information or the scientific references for the things that I'll be discussing uh I suggest going to one of these references or both one is the rootlet handbook of Animal Welfare it's open access the address is in this link you can see in the slide tiny url url um Etc and there we have a book chapter Animal Health animal welfare and Global Health where a lot of the information I'll be discussing uh is explained in in more detailed detail and the book the booklet pandemics Global health and consumer choices which is also free and can be downloaded at the welfarefoodprint.org global Health address,2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,2:09,so before starting I'd like to comment on some very good things or about global Health that happened over the last centuries and and decades and that paradoxically may be changing uh for the worse in the next decades so here we have a chart with the life expectancy from 1770 to 2021 and what we see is that there was a massive increase in life's expectancy in the next few decades from in 1950 life expectancy was less than 40 years of age and now we have most places in the world with a life expectancy above 70 years of age so this was due to a number of reasons but one of them was the decrease in the rate of mortality due to infectious diseases in the past many children under,3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,3:12,the the age of five died of several infectious diseases and through a number of changes that I'll be discussing uh this this change for the better so there's this General increase in life expectancy naturally if people were living longer and dying less then you have an increase in the in the population number so here we have the world population growth over the last 300 years with a projection to 2100 and what we see in the green area is that there was this massive increase in the number of people living on this planet in the last five to six decades we jumped from 2.5 billion people in 1950 to 8 billion people now with a forecast of 11 billion in 2100. so together with these this increase in,4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,4:18,life expectancy the technological Revolution the explosion in the world population there was a very radical transformation in the way we produce food and in the way we produce animal sourced Foods there was a complete nearly complete replacement of traditional practicing practices in animal agriculture so what many people still think when they think of farmed animals you know animals on pasture free range Etc by industrial processes so in this picture you can see what is a very uh typical facility for raising animals at the top you see a lagoon with the waste from these animals and here in this graph you can see the number of the yearly number of animals slaughtered for meat in the world just land animals fish are not included we jumped from 10 less than 10 billion,5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,5:23,in 1960. to over 70 billion in 2020 so a massive increase in the number of animals slaughtered for their food and and this increase in the number of animals Slaughter for their food is not only because there is more people in the world but because people are eating much much much more meat so here I have per capita meat consumption by type of meeting 2019 in various countries and you can see that while in the past meat was eaten occasionally in on weekends on a Sunday or just to season some recipes now it's the main dish in Maine in many countries and it and sometimes three times a day so in various countries you have over a hundred kilos of meat eaten per person per year so this is all in between three and four hundred grams of,6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,6:32,meat per day every day now along with these explosions in the number of animals the number of people on the planet what we are also witnessing in the last decades is an increase in the frequency of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases at a global scale so one new infectious disease is recognized every four months on average and most of these diseases are zoonotic Zoo from animals so which means they they are originated in animals so both wild animals bats and many different types of wild animals and domesticated farm animals that were in more close contact with now this increase this relative increase in the frequency of infectious diseases that are that are emerging again or re-emerging is concerning because different from the past where,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,7:39,populations were more or less isolated nowadays we have this huge network of communication across the globe so if you have an infectious disease that is transmit transmissible from from person to person um it can reach all corners of of the globe very quickly this is the global map of air transportation routes uh and it's easy to see why um some local public health problems are now global health problems we saw this in many large epidemics and pandemics recently now with this in mind I'll start discussing the topic of pandemics and epidemics and and why this matters for for these two Global health risks now in this map we have many of the pandemics and epidemics of the last century and their Origins and what you,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,8:40,can see is that many of them are traced back to the capture and production of animals for consumption so for example this is the case of the outbreaks of Ebola in Africa and SARS in 2003 and four both are traced back to the consumption of wild animals one more in a more natural environment another one in a live animal Market in a larger City you have the cases of swine flu in 2009 which was a pandemic many of you may remember the many outbreaks of bird flu and so on now how do the pathogens that are circulating on Wildlife you know in mild animals are transmitted to the human populations how do they spill over to the human populations well there are many possible routes uh one of them for example is through mosquitoes ticks and so on this is the case of many many infectious diseases,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,9:45,such as zika Chikungunya malaria and so on another means is by being in touch with contaminated water and food this is a common mean as well but one important thing is that if the transmission of this pathogen is not possible from person to person you need to get in touch with the mosquito with the thick the vector that transmitted the disease or with the contaminated Source water food Etc then the likelihood that this will become a pandemic is reduced because it's restricted to the area where the contaminated sources or to the area where the vector the mosquito the take circulates so for example in the case of malaria it doesn't become you know widespread globally because the mosquito is restricted to relatively warm areas tropical areas so,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,10:51,you'll not have malaria in a temperate or or cold Zone and it's not transmitted from person to person so uh disease is transmitted in this way are less likely to become very severe epidemics or pandemics now nowadays we cannot ignore the risks associated with the release of pathogens from the laboratory this is this is a risk that has been considered by many epidemiologists for some time this is a concessive statement from the Cambridge working group about the risks associated with the study of Highly lethal pathogens on the laboratory in the creation of potentially pandemic pathogens and the concern is associated with the availability of even the best Laboratories in countries like the Us and other European countries uh an investigation that was conducted on,11

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,13:06,contains the pathogen gets into gets in touch with the mucosa the eyes the nose the mouth or with you know a wound in the skin that gets in touch with the human blood then the pathogen can be transmitted either directly to a person that gets in touch with the bed the the infected pet not all bad to have the infection or intermediate hosts both wild animals and farm animals that may have been in touch with the fluids or blood of this or or contaminated fruits eaten by those those animals two more pictures of people in contact with the meat of wild animals capture for consumption and some people have the impression that um this is a practice the capture and consumption of wild animals there is practiced in remote regions in more natural regions or by more vulnerable,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,14:11,populations but it's not necessarily the case so for example a few years ago the volume of bush meat traded in the Congo Basin was about 5 million tons of meat which is a lot and not necessarily consumed by poor people so in some places bush meat is seen as a delicacy a gourmet thing so the economic development of our region may not necessarily lead to a reduction or abolition of these practices you also have the sale of wild animals on large cities in famous live animal markets or wet markets which are more abundant in Asia but also are present in different in other countries in other continents in in Africa in the Americas and so on and the risks associated with these markets are many first of all there is a,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,15:14,high diversity of pathogens from different populations that are put together on these markets uh sometimes from various species you also have a situation of acute stress for the animals some many times they are live and you have the animals on cages without water without food with noise sometimes they're hurt very poor sanitary conditions so the waste of the animals get all gets all mixed there's slaughtered sometimes on site so you you have a mixture of waste and and blood and in this situation in situations of acute stress there is typically immune suppression so the immune system of the animals is weakened and this gives opportunity for the pathogens to multiply very rapidly and to be said to be liberated on this waste in high amounts so you have a high amount of,15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,16:16,pathogens from various species various populations they can meet they can recombine their genetic material and at the same time you have hosts from the human population there which can be infected by this pathogen so the proper condition from for the emergence of of Novel pathogens and their transmission to the human populations are found in this in these markets the same logic applies to the wildlife trait so in this case wild animals that are traded not necessarily as food but for but as pets for their skin and for other uses and in this case you also have the animals in being sanding Journeys that can last several days or weeks usually in brutal conditions many perish on the journeys and those that survive are under situation of acute,16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,17:17,pain fear and distress so their immune systems are also weakened and given the possibilities of any the possibility that any pathogen they have may multiply very rapidly may be liberated very rapidly and transmit a disease and also these animals sometimes are sent to very distant places so taking you know this reservoir of pathogens spreading it across everywhere where the animal is is traded now there's a last route that I'd like to discuss which has been increasingly considered as the main risk of a major pandemic or epidemic spreading in the human population which is the transmission of pathogens through the farm animals that we raise for consumption mostly chickens and beets I think it will become clear in a few slides that the way animals are raised,17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,18:22,and trade nowadays represents a major threat to human health and well-being and that many of the conditions that translate into poor Animal Health and Welfare are also a threat to Public Health now why is intensive animal farming or industrial animal farming which is the way in which we overwhelmingly raise animals for their food nowadays why does it represent a major pandemic and epidemic risk well first of all livestock species now have more biomass more weight than other wild relatives combined so for example in the case of birds all the weight of birds on the pla of all the weight of birds on the planet 70 is of farm birds so Broiler chickens laying hands turkeys and so on and only 30 percent is of wild birds with mammals 60 percent of the,18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,19:25,weight of mammals on the planet is of farmed mammals 36 percent of the weight is from the human population and only four percent of wild mammals so this huge mess a number of animals represents a massive reservoir of pathogens of virals and bacteria that can spill over to the human population and that is in relatively closer contact with the human population than wild animals in addition to the higher probability of being infected by a pathogen from a farmed animal just because there there's a huge number of them uh also and perhaps even more importantly the ideal conditions for the emergence and transmission of zoonotic diseases are found in housing systems such as this one on the picture that involve the confinement of a large number of animals so in the case of Broiler chickens for,19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,20:31,example chickens raised for their meat you have installation facilities with fifty thousand a hundred thousand two hundred thousand animals together here are the facility with pay pigs raised for the meat also this high density the animals are in close contact so if a pathogen emerges or an animal gets infected by a pathogen in this places transmission from one animal to the other is just very rapidly it's almost immediate in addition to the high number of farmed animals on the planet and the high concentration the confinement of huge populations inside closed facilities there's also another factor that facilitates the emergence of novopathogens and their transmission to the human population which is intensive selection for fast growth and high productivity,20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,21:38,so this is the picture of a broiler chicken raise for their meat in 1957 at 56 days of age not even one kilo then in 1978 and 2005 with over four kilos at the same age so there was a 400 over 400 percent increase in the weight of the chicken in just a few decades and what that has to do with the infectious diseases and pandemics well the following one selection is almost exclusively focused on Fast growth and productivity the energy that would be dedicated to the development of important organs important physiological functions is diverted to growth of muscle mass uh and to productivity so there's less,21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,22:42,energy available for the immune function for example that gets weakened also the uh many important organs of the animal such as the heart the lungs the joints do not keep Pace with the fast grow of the muscles and so you have like shown in the picture overworked lungs the lungs do not have the capacity they should have you have a very vulnerable cardiac system and so on so an animal like this would not be viable if left alone in nature to survive it's just a machine grown to achieve the highest mass possible in the shortest shortest possible time they're slaughtered with about 40 40 something days and when they're very young if they pass that age then they start dying so you have a number of problems associated with this,22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,23:46,fast growth including over inflammatory responses to to pathogens so deregulated responses uh insufficient responses to to fight of these pathogens you have a decline in immune capacity and so on so these animals are very very vulnerable to get infected by infectious pathogens another problem with this type of selection is genetic homogeneity the animals nowaday are very very very similar so if some animals in a farm get infected the probability there will that there will be some that are different and can fight off the infection is greatly reduced so the greater the homogeneity of the animals in terms of genetics the greater the probability of major epidemics and pandemics as well so just to summarize in this flowchart uh these are the conditions associated with industrial animal production and when you have genetic selection for fast growth and high productivity first you have energy diverted from the immune,23
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,25:00,function you have low genetic diversity you have impaired organs the heart the lungs in impaired heart and lung function and this all translate into an impaired immunity weakened immunity which makes the conditions proper for pathogen transmission and achieving higher levels of violence another very important factor that makes industrial animal farming and epidemiological risk is this in these systems the animals are chronically exposed to stress when they are in confined environments there are a number of stressors that are present that I would discuss but as I had mentioned before this leads to immune suppression the weakening of the immune system what happens when farm animals and ourselves are exposed chronically to stress there is the production of cortisol which is a,24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,26:04,hormone produced by an and liberated by the adrenal gland and cortisol has a number of effects first it inhibits the proliferation of immune cells it suppresses cytokine production and cytokines are like the signaling molecules that coordinate the immune response there's also decreased production of antibodies others in general and impaired function of a number of cells such as macrophages and natural killer cells that are cells in immune systems that are important to fight off infections so you have this Cascade of responses that weakens the immune system of the animals and make them very very vulnerable to be infected so here specific example of a study with pigs in a typical Farm which showed that when exposed to psychosocial stress which they all are in the conditions,25
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,27:10,they are raised there is deregulation of inflammatory processes the impaired immune function and an increase of susceptibility to to disease now another problem is that when the animals are with the immune system weakened not only are they more vulnerable to disease but also the pathogens can multiply more easily and more quickly so for example in the case of viruses you reach very high viral loads so the the volume number of viruses is much higher and so transmission is also much more likely here's an example with chickens showing that chronic exposure to corticosterone which is also a hormone released in conditions of chronic stress it down regulates the pro-inflammatory responses and immune function of these chickens and finally an example with Minx which are the small mammals also raised in very intensive industrial conditions they are farmed not for food but for,26
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,28:20,their fur this study showed that lack of enrichment environmental enrichment because these environments are completely Barren induces a number of changes organ changes Etc associated with impaired immunity also making them much more vulnerable to infectious diseases and actually we saw that in the covid-19 outbreak you had a number of outbreaks of coronavirus in Ming farms in Europe so what would be typical stressors in the animal farming industry well High Stocking densities as we saw the deprivation of behaviors that animals are highly motivated to perform such as foraging exploration they like to explore the environment and they can sometimes they're in cages or density of the population is too high or they are limited in their movements because of their genetic they are too heavy or they have pain so they cannot move they can,27
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,29:24,chickens cannot dust bathe typically many don't have a nest to lay an egg they cannot pack on the ground etc etc etc so there's also limited opportunities for movement as I said in some cases social isolation so for example in case of female pigs uh used as kept in gestation crates they cannot move they cannot turn around at their socially isolated even though they're very social annual maternal deprivation so youngsters are taken from their mothers very very early um short sleep periods either because the lights are on or because they get um you know in the case of broilers because of the very high density their rest is interrupted by touching of the other birds very frequently limited access to sunlight to natural,28
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,30:24,light this is also another stressor they are frequently most often closed in indoor environments and the fear and the pain associated with management practices that are very typical and widespread such as the motilation of body parts so surgical castration in the case of mayo pigs tail docking uh teeth clipping um big trimming ear notching dehorning and so many so going back to this picture and putting some more factors then we have high densities behavioral suppression there's also poor air quality in this facilities you have a very high number of animals and you can imagine a very high volume of waste and when this waste evaporates it creates a very high concentration of ammonia in the air which is very aversive so in addition to the aversion it causes it also helps to,29
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,31:31,impair heart and mostly lung function so here again the first barriers against pathogens you know the mechanical barriers in the respiratory cells of the animals because of the poor air quality are also impaired helping impair immune function and all these factors that I mentioned also create chronic stairs stress which is also associated with weakened immune function so putting still some extra factors the high densities facilitates pathogen transmission from one animal to the other there's a very high contact rate and also something that's not so discussed is that in this indoor environments uh with lack of sunlight and wet soils wet floors pathogen survival tends to be much longer the virus the bacteria doesn't die so easily so the transmission of the pathogen is facilitated for example in the case of influenza the virus of the the influenza,30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,32:39,virus when it's in contact with sunlight it's desiccated much more rapidly and in in dry environments it's desiccated much more rapidly so we are creating the ideal conditions for not only for the virus to multiply for the virus to find weakened hosts but also for the virus to survive for a very long time and this facilitates not only Transmissions but transmission but also the evolution of Greater violence greater pathogenicity levels so in summary in industrial animal farming we have the ideal recipe The Perfect Storm for the emergence of major epidemics and pandemics we have much higher contact rates we have much more likely and longer viral survival we have suppressed immunity in the hosts and we have a genetic variability that is greatly reduced so this is ideal for,31
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,33:43,the emergence of major epidemics and pandemics now discuss a very specific case which is associated with the risks of a pandemic of bird food so bird flu is a type of influenza virus flu virus that affects Birds mostly but has also infected humans and some other animals and in the case of humans the people who got infected were those that got in touch with an infected bird or with the waste of an infected bird now the greatest concern is this is until now the the bird flu has not become a major epidemic or pandemic because the virus does not have the capacity to be transmitted from person to person in a sustained way so the the concern here is if the virus were to mutate in a way that made it,32
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,34:44,more transmissible from person to person and the flu could spread it could it could spread very very quickly and this is dangerous because different from other viruses some strains of bird flu have a very high lethality rate some higher than 50 percent so every 10 people who get infected five die so if this were to happen and we had a pandemic of respiratory viruses that is transmissible from person to person and with this very high fatality rate this could take uh this could lead to a collapse of of civilization with covid-19 we had what we had with a mortality rate depending on the risk group of up to one percent and you all saw the disruption that it all that it caused so imagine a mortality rate of 50 so basic Services food provisioning you know sanitary services medical services,33
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,35:51,any basic service would be completely collapsed and this is something that probably we would take a very very long time to recover so here are some highly pathogenic pathogenic avian flu viruses that have infected humans h5n1 the possibly the most severe one with a death rate of over 50 percent age 7 and 9 with death rate of between 20 and 40 percent and H5 and 6 with a mortality rate of 25 to 50 so this is very very very high and here just a chart showing this mortality rate in the case of h5n1 for the various countries where people were infected by this flu virus and on average we have that 50 percent of the people who got infected died that varied from 100 in Canada for example because just one or two people were infected to zero percent also because the number of,34
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,37:02,people infected was low but also some more reasonable numbers in in countries where more people got infected and here's some some new stories uh showing you know General Global concern about the spread of Avian Influenza recently so cases of age five and six in humans in China the fast spread of bird flu outbreaks in Europe and Asia human cases of bird flu surging in China the largest global bird flu outbreak in history in a newspaper in France and uh cases of H7 and 9 in in Canada in China as well so there's General concern with the rapid spread that the flu outbreaks are are having,35
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,38:04,in general the threat of a flu pandemic is now higher because of a number of factors first there have been increases in the number and Geographic spread of bird flu infections in birds in the number of subtypes of bird flu viruses that have infected these birds and in the number of species that the bird flu viruses have infected we also have seen a number of outbreaks globally since 2020 there have been a very high number of Highly pathogenic avian flu outbreaks more outbreaks in 2020 and 2021 than in the four previous years combined and over 60 countries reported the h5n1 the highly lethal outbreaks in Birds so again reminding why is this happening we have the perfect recipe for highly pathogenic strengths to emerge and spread rapidly we have high contact,36
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,39:09,rates long virus Revival hosts that are immune suppressed and low genetic variability and it's not surprising that when studied what researchers found is that the conversion of the flu virus from low pathogenicity low lethality to high pathogenicity the genetic conversion happened predominantly in places where intensive farming intensive bird farming was pervasive so 36 out of the 39 events of genetic conversion of strains of low pathogenicity to high pathogenicity that were identified happened in commercial farms in countries where intensive production prevails or in countries transitioning to intensive production and the concerns are not only with birds with Broiler chickens laying hands,37
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,40:15,turkeys Etc it's also with pigs and in the pig in in the case of pigs there is also an additional factor that is concerning which is this pigs are very very similar physiologically similar anatomically similar to humans we had insulin some decades ago from pigs being used to treat diabetes in humans we have a heart transplantation from pigs to humans and so on and also the respiratory cells of pigs have receptors for the bird flu virus they have receptors for the human flu virus and they have receptors for the swine flu virus so why is this concerning because all these viruses are able to infect the respiratory cells of pig of pigs and they're able to meet,38
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,41:16,inside the cells and when they meet the conditions might be created for them to Interchange genetic material so imagine the human flu virus combining with the bird flu virus inside the cell of a pig and the the bird flu virus a highly lethal bird flu virus acquiring the capacity to be transmissible from person to person which is present in the human flu virus so this could mean a catastrophe for for in terms of pandemic risk so here we have a global map of the distribution of avian flu outbreaks in 2021 and 2022 as you can see in just this two years you have outbreaks not only in Asia but also all over Europe North America Africa it's only South America there is not present here but this has changed this year in 2023,39
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,42:25,the paho now issued an alert that bird flu outbreaks are now seen in 10 countries in South America and what is perhaps one of the most concerning things we have seen recently was an outbreak of h5n1 the severe type bird flu in minks which is a mammal raised for their fur in a Spanish farm and this is not any case the transmission in this Farm was happening from memo to memo so this shows that h5n1 has already achieved the capacity for sustained transmission from memo to memo and again this is not any memo the minks are in the same family as ferrets which are used in flu research exactly because the flu symptoms they developed and the progression of symptoms is very similar to what happens in humans and,40
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,43:26,not surprisingly the Spanish Farm was an intensive Farm where animals were confined in cages in the U.S for example most of the poultry Farms affected by the birth flow outbreaks were also intensive confinement Farms so in the case of minks this is a red flag of what may come next the typical answer response from the industry in because of all these risks is to focus on increasing biosecurity in animal operations but does this really work so as mentioned here by a visiting scholar when there's public discussion addressing sonaric diseases in in factory farms uh everyone public agents industry Etc almost immediately turned to vaccination preparedness biosecurity Etc let's see let's see if it works although the implementation of,41
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,44:28,biosecurity protocols may help if you know how an animal production operation works you can easily see that it's impossible to control the spread of pathogens from inside the operations to outside the operations particularly respiratory pathogens such as flu first of all you have the ventilation system which pushes air out of the facilities and with this the viruses research has shown that you find viruses in near closed animal operations with very strict biosecurity protocols a hundred meters 200 meters outside far from these facilities also you have the use of waste from the animals as fertilizer in other in other regions you have insects rodents that get in and out of the facilities you have,42
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,45:32,um Personnel you have equipment you have garbage that takes the pathogens out of the facility you have the carcasses of dead animals that died before Slaughter that are also taken out of the facilities you have the live animals that are transport that are sent to the slaughterhouses houses or they are sent abroad in very long Journeys so how do you control the spread of respiratory pathogen in a truck or in a boat so it's extremely difficult to to control it even if biosecurity protocols were strictly implemented and we know that they aren't everywhere where this was studied evening countries such as Sweden Denmark Norway Etc in every place this was studied there was there were breaches of biosecurity that were found so it's nearly it's impossible actually to to control the spread of pathogens to,43
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,46:42,outside the facilities particularly if they are respiratory pathogens and this is something the industry itself recognizes this is a slogan from the industry which says that a small risk repeated a hundred a thousand times becomes a big risk I would add that the risk is not small and it's repeated more much more than a thousand times so this is this becomes a major risk and let's remember that even in high security labs in the best universities in in the US in European countries we have very high number of incidents so if the Escape of viruses cannot be controlled even under this extremely strict conditions let alone in thousands and thousands of of farms spread all over the globe it doesn't matter if there is high beer Security in a state or in a country if another country doesn't have it then the problem the,44
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,47:50,local problem as I mentioned becomes a global problem so this is extremely difficult to to control if if not impossible and when we see these concerns with bird flu frequently we also see news such as this that free range eggs are no longer available and that people should not have backyard birds Etc and this idea is based on a major epidemiological mistake which is to focus on transmission which as we are discussing it's possible it's impossible to control at the large scale needed instead of better immunity so we have seen that a conversion to highly pathogenic strings are inherently tied to Industrial animal farming conditions and on the contrary the animals in this alternative extensive type of system usually have better genetics and more resilient to,45
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,48:57,disease Etc so the mistake of trying to to control a virus a respiratory viruses is is a widespread one and when the focus should be really on making animals and people more resilient to to disease not never in contact with a pathogen and it may be clear by now that live animal transportation is a major epidemiological risk every year we have over 2 billion animals loaded onto ships and trucks and cents and Journeys national International that may last from 20 25 hours up to weeks in the case of animal sent abroad and as you know High contact rates high density high levels of acute stress in the strips the animals are without water without food exposed to cold stress to heat stress sometimes they are fractured,46
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,50:04,they are wounded they have fear so the level of immune suppression the weakening of the immune system is very pronounced giving the opportunity for pathogens to multiply very rapidly to be released in their waist as well there's also a mix of populations of animals from different Farms from different regions so the possibility of mixing of the genetic material of these pathogens is also very high and this again is a very good recipe for for pathogen transmission and the emergence of new ones this is a global map of the live swine trades so they also sent life to many countries and it's interesting that this authors mentioned that the following wild waterfall have long been considered the most important Reservoir host and pandemic risk to influenza but memos are emerging as key reservoirs to,47
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFjcRjQG_8,Animal agriculture and the risk of pandemics,Welfare Footprint Project,26 Mar 2023,51:07,modernization of swine production during the last half century provided new opportunities for influenza A viruses to become established in swine globally so pandemic preparedness efforts must be based on the notion first that it's extremely difficult to predict which pathogen will cause the next pandemic we have been trying to do that and in the epidemiological community and we have failed time and again how this pathogen will behave when and where it will emerge or two it's extremely difficult to control transmission once it emerges so more than predicting the next pandemic it's necessary to identify and mitigate those factors that make us vulnerable to new pandemics and epidemics an intensive animal farming is first on that list so thank you very much I hope you found,48

And this is where a lot of the solution can be found, is to actually get owned cattle, owners, farmers to be more responsible for their cows and not let them wander the streets.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,1:06,they can change over time as we'll see in uh today's talk and these narratives can influence the way that we interpret the world so it can provide a lens through which we interpret events and it can um shape how we behave by kind of dictating social norms and so with that in mind uh the narrative research project is about finding the most effective cultural narratives that will help to persuade the UK public to support the animal Freedom Movement and sometimes um it's it's a good idea to kind of sit back and take stock and look at kind of where we've come from and what we've achieved in the past think about like what lessons we've learned and use that knowledge to um improve our advocacy in the future so to give it like an overview of what um I'll be talking about so first looking back I'm going to be giving a,2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,2:07,potted history of animal narratives and the social and cultural events that have helped shape those narratives as well as um and then I'll be doing an analysis of the today's dominant narrative which is the go vegan narrative then we'll be looking forward and we'll be talking about potential new narratives that we could use in addition to those existing ones that will bolster our advocacy and thinking about what lessons can we learn from the past so to give you an example of a cultural narrative uh the American dream you know this is the idea that anyone can come to America and through their own self-reliance and hard work and discipline uh they can make a good life for themselves and this values things like individualism and equal opportunity and this narrative is has pervaded throughout their culture so for example it influences um the products they buy or,3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,3:10,the types of houses they buy like here's a picture of the American dream with the white picket fence at the front um and it even influences who they see as Heroes like the kind of rugged individualistic action man um and narratives also influence our attitudes towards animals amongst also sorts of things so the first example I'm giv here is the kind of meat is manly myth and this is a narrative that um eating meat is a signal of like strength and power and it kind of ties into that like Hunter gather a myth that once upon a time it was the man's role to kind of go out and provide the protein and support and protect the tribe basically another very widely held myth or narrative is the meat is necessary myth and this is um a narrative that's pushed quite heavily by the animal agriculture industry um and that is that uh meat is kind of necessary for our own,4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,4:14,Survival and thriving and it has all the necessary protein and micronutrients and so on that we need but these narratives also don't need to be about the food that people eat it can also be about place in the world and our relationship with other animals so one very longstanding and deeply ingrained narrative is that of human exceptionalism so this is the idea that there's kind of like a natural hierarchy in terms of natural moral hierarchy with humans at the top and maybe humans are in fact separate and distinct from other animals like a lot of people don't even consider themselves as animals so this is our theory of narrative change like when we're doing advocacy we are planting seeds in people's minds but the challenge is at the moment there's kind of like an infertile cultural landscape so at the moment the narratives aren't there to support those,5

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,6:19,people we love this um resonated with people across the political Spectrum so this narrative alongside lots of Hard lot lots of hard work helped them win marriage equality very rapidly in the US so I'll give my um kind of potted history um of these narratives uh starting in the 19th century and at that time the kind of dominant existing view was that animals are sort of like automater or like robots so they're kind of these input response machines um so this image of like a robot dock actually um was from the 18th century and they they obviously didn't think that animals were full of cogs and wires but it kind of reflects the sort of thinking of like these input response machines which effectively had no feeling and no sentience another view of animals at the time was uh that an animal's value was,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,7:23,entirely derived from their utility so how useful they are to humans and what they can produce for us and at the time the science of selective breeding was taken off so in the 1800s um there was this sort of period of time um where people were commissioning these paintings of rectangular cows and it was basically breeders kind of wanted to show off their like their their prize read and so they commission paintings um to show how big and well-bred they were these huge bulking bodies on like spindly legs but also during that time there was a growing awareness that animals do in fact feel pain and experience things and therefore because of that they their welfare should be considered and some of the events that shaped that um were for example there were scientific advancements so we were gaining a better understanding of how humans process pain as well as physiology and so we kind of recognized like well we they must be feeling pain they've got a similar kind of nervous,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,8:31,system to us and then also um Richard Martin who was a member of parliament at the time he helped pass um the first um piece of wealth Animal Welfare legislation which was the cruel treatment of animals act in 1822 he then went on to establish the rspca which is um the Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to animals um and they're a huge animal welfare charity in the UK who will be actually their Bicentennial is this year additionally like during the 19th century um there was this rise of naturalism and interest in um understanding the natural world so people were understanding like how nature worked and it led to this like reverence of Nature and then also like um Charles Darwin uh published the origin of species that explained how um species,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,9:32,evolve through natural selection and this kind of took humans out of this special place and put us in the family tree with the rest of animal the animal kingdom and in fact you know Darwin became atheist after kind of developing his theory so most of the 19th century uh the dominant pro-animal narrative was one of welfare is there was very little in terms of um real fundamental animal rights or abolition but there were a couple of examples uh the first being um in the 1870s there was an anti section movement and also the possibly the first animal rights uh sort of treaties written by Henry salt in 1894 um and he argued that animals should be regarded sentient beings and that because of this they're deserving of moral,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,10:34,consideration um and although the term speciesism wouldn't be coined for another 76 years um he basically argued against speciesism and I think these sort of animal rights abolitionists used were kind of a bit of ahead of their time at this point in time so moving on to the 20th century for the first kind of half of the 20th century there didn't really seem to be much progress made in terms of animal Freedom there was kind of incremental welfare reforms but not much else and then in the 1950s um the BBC started giving nature showing Nature Documentaries with uh for example David atenor um where he would kind of explore nature and we get to learn about wildlife and this again increased this narrative of reverence for nature as well as an increase in valuing conservation uh which is a good thing of course um one slight challenge of this,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,11:40,narrative though is that it puts the emphasis on conserving the species um so um you know as long as the species is conserved or the populations are conserved people see that as a good thing regardless of how the individuals within that population are treated then um in the 1960s uh Ruth Harrison um published the book um animal machines and this was when factory farming was really starting to take off and she actually coined the term factory farming and so in her book she kind of exposed like the cruelty and the really terrible treatment that the animals were going through on these farms and in terms of narrative uh this was really important because it kind of exposed the the industries narrative that animals are just kind of these like objects um or Commodities that function like machines sort of like continuing on,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,12:42,from that autometer narrative that I mentioned earlier and unfortunately this narrative still seems to persist amongst the industry so for example uh might have been last year I think Earthling Ed um had a TV debate with a sheep farmer who said sheeper almost the ultimate renewable technology um then in the 1970s uh Peter Singer published animal Liberation and um by this time the term speciesism had been coined um so he basically his thesis was to argue against speciesism and that his point was basically you know the capacity for suffering and enjoyment should be the only criteria criteria for consideration regardless of any other um any other criteria like species or intelligence and so on and therefore the interests of all animals should be weighed equally then into the 1970s and 80s we,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,13:47,saw the rise of direct action so for example um the animal Liberation Front would break into facilities and rescue animals and the hunt sabots associ iation um would disrupt um fox hunting and so the narrative here is you know this is an urgent moral issue that cannot wait right things there's animals in need now who need to be helped and unfortunately the traditional roots of things like gaining popular support or passing legislation are just too slow and ineffective unfortunately this kind of approach Poss Poss had some uh unintended consequences so particularly with the types of clothing worn by the animal Liberation Front it created this perception of like radical extremist and militant Animal Advocates and that kind of militant vegan Trope continues to,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,14:48,this day so if you search for articles about militant vegans you'll get pictures of people simply holding signs um so it's very easy to be labeled militant these days then into the 1990s and the 2000s there was growing awareness of how our consumption patterns and the products we buy have effects around the globe on the environment on animal welfare on humans um and so there began to grow this Consumer Power narrative that is we can influence the World by voting with our wallets we can buy the high welfare eggs um or or the fair trade um sugar for example and during this time we um we saw the rise of things like the fair trade logo or the rspca assured logo um or rainforest Alliance which would be on products telling consumers that these are these are better products and,15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,15:53,actually yeah I remember when I was at University in 2006 I was part of the fair TR trade society and I also remember at the time like um caged eggs from caged hens were were like the main thing being sold in shops and there seemed to be this shift where people became aware that that was not a good thing and I remember buying the sort of free range eggs thinking oh isn't this so much better of course you know I know better than that now I like to think um so now into this Century um so at the start of the 2000s there was kind of an a rise second generation of popularity of these Nature Documentaries with David at are still narrating them 50 years later um and this again helped raise Consciousness about environmentalism and conservationism which you know again is great for wild animals and um helping conservationism but like I mentioned earlier um it puts,16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,16:56,the focus on population um so I've heard people say things like oh well if we got rid of farming you know all these you know cows would go extinct or something like that without so people are thinking like of the population or the species rather than the individuals who are actually suffering in these systems and of course these shows would focus on the wild animals and those exploited on farms or in Laboratories be left behind um over the last 20 years there's also been an increase in intersectionality so that is the relationship between the animal Freedom Movement and other social justice issues so that could be like Health environment feminism workers rights and so on and but just to give two examples um during I don't know if anyone remembers a couple of years ago there was this big pandemic um and we all had to stay,17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,18:00,indoors um and at the time it there was a an increased awareness of zuntic diseases um and people became aware of practices that we humans are doing to other animals not just these wet markets in China but also factory farming and how these are breeding grounds for new diseases that are going to harm animals as well as ourselves there's also been um stream of uh relating the um animal freedom to The Climate crisis so for example animal Rebellion pushed for um changing the food system to one of a plant-based food system which would help to cut our emissions and draw down um carbon additionally in the last few years um with the rise of social media we we've probably all seen online like posts and videos of these cute animals and which has certainly helped Foster greater connection and kinship with other animals and increased our love for,18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,19:10,what people would call PL animals uh which is great but also again might have there's might be a kind of a double-edged sword to this um for example it may have increased sort of infantilization of these animals of and you hear them referred to as like fur babies or dogos or something like that um and of course like the other narrative I mentioned exploited animals on farms that aren't perceived as cute or even you know animals that would be considered pests or not cute animals also kind of largely left out again so there seems to be speciesism at play basically like some species are worthy of our attention While others are or not so next I'd like to talk about today's dominant narrative and I would argue that that dominant narrative is the go vegan narrative so this is kind of evolved out,19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,20:13,"of the ethical consumer narrative that I talked about earlier and that is that um changing the world relies on individual level change so by voting with our wallets we can boycott the the bad Industries and support the good ones and it seems to have been you know taken off in the last few years we've all at least in the UK we've all seen the a boom in popularity of vegan alternative proteins and this is a graph of signups to vegan um which is a charity that encourages people to try a vegan diet for the year of January and every year they've had more and more signups and even though this is only up till 20 21 I think this year it's continued Rising they've had 700,000 signups this year there are a few kind of problems though so firstly it doesn't seem like the actual number of vegans is increasing um our research when we've conducted surveys we find about 2% of",20

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,22:22,think like say things like well if they don't want to eat meat why do they eat T eat things that taste like and you know if you think of it as just a dietary choice that kind of makes sense there's also a psychological barrier so there's a social cost to becoming vegan um that is if you become vegan you now have to join this radical uh militant outgroup who are pretty vilified by Society at large there's also a perception of the you know even if you accept those things a perception of having to give up too much I think a lot of us have heard from others non-vegans um that a vegan diet is basically eating rabbit food and so it puts the focus on what that individual is going to be losing out um and it takes attenion away potentially of uh the the animals and the plight and the benefit that they will gain from it and so because of these things and,22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,23:25,also because we as humans want to maintain what's called a positive self-image that is we want to see ourselves as as good generally um but if someone comes up to you and says well you eat meat and that's bad that attacks your positive self-image and as a general rule people would rather do things to protect that self-image so there's many documented um coping or strategies or defense strategies that people utilize so for example the four ends which is uh that neat is uh necessary natural normal and nice U another very difficult one to overcome is futility so like okay well let's say you know I can eat a vegan diet um it's kind of futile anyway because even if I change seven billion other people aren't going to so what's the point and then there's things like price and convenience that are kind of common misconceptions about vegan diets another final drawback is that it,23
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,24:34,prevents like big picture thinking so of course individual consumer habits are part of this bigger system it's one of the cogs in the machine but by focusing on that it kind of prevents this systemic thinking um so with that in mind I'm not saying we should stop advocating for people to eat to to be vegan they absolutely should but what other the new narratives that we can use in addition to that narrative that potentially could maybe get around some of these cognitive defense strategies so the first um one that I'd like to talk about is a systemic narrative so that is that you know we are people of our time um there's this system that's held up by cultural norms history as well as corporate and political incentiv that maintain that system and if we say it's the system at large that we're part of that's not attacking them as an individual and hopefully this will kind of get around,24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,25:38,those defense strategies um one example of using this quite successfully in the UK um animal Rising have a plant-based universities campaign where they're getting students to um vote on for their student or sorry students in student unions to vote for the cafes and cafeterias on their campus to offer plant-based food and they're having a bit of success at this throughout the country and you know this is a systemic change and now anyone who walks into that cafe will automatically be changing their consumption habits and changing the demand for um meat or plant-based food another narrative um that research uh has been shown to be effective is the voter or citizen frame so you know like in this example picture here you can see yourself as a consumer but you can also see yourself as a citizen who's an active participant in the Democratic,25
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,26:40,process and in this narrative we're saying you can use your political power in addition to of course the purchases you make to vote sign petitions call your Member of Parliament and so on and one reason this might be an effective narrative is because voting or signing a petition is a much smaller change than this like complete identity shift um and it opens up the possibility for further transformation so what a lot of psychological research has found is that our values are actually informed by the behaviors we engage in rather than the other way around like the intuition is we have our values and then we pick behaviors cons with those but what people actually tend to do is kind of go right what's my behavior oh I seem to be in suppor of banning factory farming so actually that's bad um but,26
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,27:43,another aspect to this narrative or a narrative that might kind of work in conjunction with it is the social progress narrative so this is the narrative that um there's this societal struggle it's not just an individual one that's up to you to make changes and that Society is inevitably progressing which I think we can see from like our little potted history earlier like we are moving in the right direction um I think the benefit of this narrative is it avoids that sense of futility like we are going to get there we're on the path to getting there and um our research as well as research by others has found that this actually increases support for animal rights and animal freedom and so the idea is that by voting you can get you can be part of this bigger solution um oh and I'd like to give an example of um this narrative in use so Peter um have released their Christmas,27
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,28:45,ad for this year and the ad includes a turkey singing about all the weird Traditions that we have at Christmas like putting trees indoors lighting Christmas puddings on fire or kissing beneath the mistletoe and like they're all a bit weird aren't they if you actually think about it um and one tradition in particular is eating turkey at Christmas um essentially they're saying like you know what we can still keep all the fun stuff about Christmas those silly traditions we just give up this one little one that's harmful so I'd like to kind of finish on like what lessons can we learn um lesson one um so this is kind of what lesson can we learn for uh kind of narrative strategy what um narratives can um advoca you know advocacy groups use um to better facil better improve their advocacy so I think the first one is to think about like how does our strategy affect public perception so if you saw this picture and you'd never heard of the animal Liberation Front you might actually think these guys are like,28
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,29:56,holding these dogs hostage rather than trying to save them um so wearing masks and looking militant that I'm sure they had good reasons and rationale for it at the time but it's might have had a backfire effect on public perception um and I'd like to give an example of doing this effectively um so direct action everywhere have had this strategy of open rescue where they've gone into farms and rescued sick and injured animals um without the masks they're just showing themselves like we are just regular people we care about animals just like everyone else this is a moral issue like if you heard a neighbor's companion animal being abused next door you'd intervene um and this is as a result it's getting it into the courts and into the court of public opinion um and I don't know when but sometime today I believe he's having his sentencing and being decided some point today um as,29
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,31:00,well so lesson two um is I think we need to find narratives that don't activate these defense strategies that I talked about um we need to find narratives that avoid attacking people's positive self-image like can they still get involved without feeling like they are the problem or they should be guilty um and I think we can achieve this by focusing on systemic change such as like asking people people to be in the voter frame instead of the consumer frame um and the ex like the example I gave earlier um animal risings plant-based universities campaign is a really good example of that lesson three um is to think about the N the weaknesses of our narrative so I know the documentaries weren't necessarily um promoted by Animal Advocates or you know activists um but they have helped promote conservation and like I said,30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,32:03,kind of one sort of unintended consequence is that they created uh the perception that the level we should care about is about is the level of species or population and it's neglected the plights of individual animals another example is kind of like this Rising cute pet pictures on social media obviously this help has helped our kinship perception of kinship with dogs and cats but it's neglected um our relationship with other animals like pigs and sheep and cows and chickens and it's kind of created this it it's in forc that the it's kind of strengthened the different categories that we have in our minds about different animals so I think we need to um find narratives and people are already doing doing this of course that focus on individuals rather than the group um and focus on the amazing inner lives of these animals that they are compassionate intelligent feeling they,31
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,33:11,enjoy life they want to live and they don't want to suffer and yeah I think that brings me to the end so I welcome any questions and best muted okay where's NASA hang on if I do it there you go hooray we can hear you now yes i' I'd been uh my my my host status was TR was cruy usurped okay thank you very much for that Rob we do have just under 20 minutes no just over 20 minutes actually for a for a Q&A so anybody who'd like to hang around and ask some questions please uh feel free to put them in the chat now I think what um is always really interesting for me is the go vegan narrative is I always feel like it sounds like,32
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,34:18,we're we're decrying it when we're we're not really it's definitely a good narrative for sort of individual change but it's this systemic change that needs to be part of that needs to be part of our strategy as well and again change it from this consumer View to a more citizen kind of view so while we wait if there's any more uh comments in the chat I'll have a I'll bring your attention Rob to some of the things we've been um we've been uh talking about in the chat while you've been talking so um Serenity uh before she left she was saying this is interesting I wonder if talking about animal Freedom would be more effective than talking about animal rights and then Harriet added to that you can create lovely positive stories about an animal's Freedom till of its life Rob do you have any comments yeah so I I think that aligns with our thinking very much that um everyone like I think freedom is easier,33
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,35:22,to get like we all want freedom whereas rights are very kind of abstract and esoteric um so yeah I think we should be talking about animal Freedom maybe emphasizing that more than animal rights but of course we not to say that these are different things like you can still have the freedom from um cruelty right instead of the right to be protected from cruelty so far um we've done a bit of research on it and um we did some message testing where we would ask different groups to read different messages kind of advocating for either animal Freedom or animal rights and um in terms of how that those messages affect their Val like their values towards those things there wasn't actually any difference um it could be you know in 10 years time if we use that narrative the freedom narrative that will change and we also did some analysis on kind of their understanding,34
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,36:23,of that and there does seem to be a much more kind of concrete understanding of what Freedom looks like like people can actually imagine that in their head whereas rights is a bit harder to kind of grapple with yeah I agree yeah rights is much more um it's a much more legal frame as opposed to an emotional one isn't it um we do we have had a few questions come through in the chat but before we do one thing I I just wanted to uplift you mentioned uh the um 1822 cruel act against the cruel and improper treatment of cattle and Alex mentioned in the chat that they've just produced a six-part Audio Drama podcast for the 200th uh anniversary of the course yeah so um there's about 30 interviews included with Carol Adams and Richard Ryder that's been mentioned and the um there was a link um in the chat that,35
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,37:25,Alex added but I will just paste it again and Melda is highly recommending uh Alex's podcast too so few recommendations there everybody excellent maybe we could share it later as well you put it in the chat as well yeah I put it in the chat I think it's something to definitely I know I'll be listening um okay couple of questions in the chat uh from Harriet Maybe maybe focusing on populations of domestic animals might be interesting for example the number of animals who are incarcerated in factory farms in Europe as we speak I think individual stories linked to the big picture could be very powerful that's um a great Point yeah I agree and it's something we need to do more testing on in the future I have a feeling um sometimes I've seen people kind of trying to Advocate by saying like look how many animals are slaughtered every minute or something like that I have a feeling that probably,36
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,38:31,creates this sense of futility that I was talking about like oh it's such a big problem um what can we do and that might even be a challenge that we face with the systemic Narrative Approach you know it's not it's GNA have its own challenges as well um yeah yeah yeah it's difficult isn't it because numbers facts always hit less hard than feelings like you know I think it's Beno who says facts don't care about your feelings but the reality is that our feelings don't care about facts so um I I do like this idea of like individual stories linked to the big picture and I think this is we've got a real opportunity around Wayne's sentencing with with quing actually I'm not quite sure how to pronounce pronounce her name but I think it's quing the the female chicken that he rescued because she is a really she exemplifies that um individual story that really speaks so I'd love to not like she's just it could have been anyone else yeah yeah yeah yeah it could have been anyone else it,37
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,39:37,would be really good to know more about her like you know what does she enjoy who is she and I think that's the kind of narrative that we can we could really use like that absolutely yeah okay um a question from Courtney I'd like like to talk a bit more about how we can coordinate message frames across the movement especially how given how effective our opposition has been in that F in this vein at least in the US and that's yeah I think we'd like to coordinate yeah definitely need to um I mean in terms of what we're working on we are working on like we want sort of narrative Unity basically I think that will be really powerful um so it's something we've got our eye on and we we've released a messaging guide in Janu I forgotten a few months ago no it was in March later was later than that it it was really recently it was I don't even know what month we're in anymore but hey check out our website we've got a messaging guide um and we'll be releasing like the next version um early,38
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,40:44,next year as well and it'll be based on like all the research that we're doing and like the um the narratives that we're finding to be more effective so hopefully yeah I totally agree we need to all be on board and finding narratives that are the most effective okay um sorry I've got lost in the in the chat scrolling um so Abby says wondering if you can say more about the research behind how taking a small action opens up the possibility of an individual making larger changes what sort of Next Step actions are people most likely to take after a small voting type back action um so I oh this is yeah I have no specific studies are coming to mind this is just kind of like my general knowledge of psychology um so there's this idea of there's like different persuasion tactics so like one of them is called the this is the foot in the door technique where you kind of get them to agree to something small and once you've done that getting something slightly,39
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,41:52,larger is becomes much easier so maybe signing a petition um on Facebook or whatever is like very easy to do but then next thing you find yourself joining a Facebook group and then you end up attending a meeting I don't I don't know these are just madeup examples and but yeah like I was saying like a lot of psychology shows that our behaviors are kind of mostly influenced by habits and our environment and then we then interpret our values based on the way we're behaving um so getting that foot in the door kind of might be a good approach I don't know I hope I've answered your question there certainly given us a lot certainly given us something to think about yeah okay uh I think we had a a question from from malda who's going to be,40
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,42:49,unmuted thank you sorry I'm too tired to type out this question I'm Ill in bed with covid oh but thank you so much for your presentation um I'm doing my PhD research on um animal rising and their strategies and I was doing a literature review on the animal rights movements history so this has me a lot of good good material I'll definitely watching the recording um my question is and I'm curious about what ATI thinks about this because obviously I'm an abolitionist vegan um and this is the thing that I struggle with the most because you've mentioned in your presentation that um vegan numbers keep staying the same however vegetarians and flexitarians these numbers are increasing um so as um animal Freedom Fighters do we an abolitionists do we Champion um vegetarianism and,41
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,43:53,flexitarianism as a stepping stone um you know it's it's a pragmatic strategy but you know it breaks my heart to say someone oh yeah you know try vegetarian first and then you know I I also find that some people are obviously more um open to um more subtler forms of you know vegetarian you know flexitarian foods and I'm living with um a flexitarian at the moment so I also find that me being less radical has more impact on them and this this has been my personal advocacy as well in Turkey you know um can I just interrupt you there sorry Beth's got a point I think well I'm I was happy to let Melda finish okay sorry anything else to say I'm rumbling on but um yeah as an abolitionist like morally this is my biggest moral conflict it's a big challenge I felt,42
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,44:51,that as well I totally get where you're coming from I feel like I mean so for my journey I tried going vegan with my girlfriend at the time now wife um eight years before I went vegan and then it was several years of like pondering it being a flexitarian then a vegetarian and then eventually vegan um I think we have like it is difficult I don't think I think ultimately we have to say like this is what we stand for you know we we're not going to kind of give up on our values um but we have to acknowledge like the psychology of it is that for for most people going from Full meaty to to vegan it is perceived as too much of a big step um so I think if we do it in the right way where we acknowledge like look we we've been indoctrinated from a very young age that this is the way to do things and there's a lot of like cultural baggage,43
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,45:52,that we sort of need to shake off to get there and I think that's okay and yeah is pragmatic probably going to get people there um sooner but also this is talking about like Diet change so you know like I was saying like if we get people thinking in the um citizen frame we're more like you know they can get engaged and we've research has shown that a lot of standard practices the vast majority of people are against so there's lots of things we can get people on board with without them necessarily being and then hopefully that leads to personal growth down the line Sorry Beth well I was going to say if I can make a point I I don't think I I think that lowering the barrier to entry is is really helpful I think that not having to be vegan like I so when I joined animal dink tank I wasn't vegan and I was the barrier to entry was was low it allowed me to get,44
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,46:54,involved from the place of care that I understood at that time because ATT connected with me on a shared value of compassion and I you know even when I was eating meat I was a compassionate person I just was stuck in that frame so if you connect with people on that value of compassion you can get them to act without NE they can they can advocate for systemic change without necessarily making that individual change and with systemic change comes more individual change but obviously with more individual change comes more systemic change it's not like they're not connected it's not either all no well that's great you shared that Beth and thanks for your answer Rob yeah yeah and I'd love to hear more about your um thesis um and what you found as well because this is I'm learning about all this stuff as well yeah I've just started um so you will I will be sharing um once I collect more data and I'm definitely that would be great okay,45
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,47:58,thank you mder um I have another and I must apologize if I Butch of the pronunciation of your name but cash cashia I think may be how it's it's pronounced so you have um she has two questions so the first one's more of a comment I'm wondering who would be described as the carriers of narratives mentioned in the 19 century before the mass before mass media Etc because of ill literacy there's not much written evidence however I'm aware of some preserved materials in Poland that shows the peasantry was very aware that animals feel pain uh it's interesting how with a narrative shaped were there any not dominant narratives not quite sure what that means just at the end there or was yeah I I guess were there were there any dominant narratives or were there like lots of little communities of narratives I guess is is what what she means that yeah probably um I this is kind of hitting the limits of my knowledge to be honest um but you,46
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,49:00,know when we talk so like I so at the started when I was talking about like 19th century narratives like on the one hand you had the kind of perception of them being like robots and on the other like they actually do feel pain and are sentient um there's probably like both at the same time like they still are now like some people believe in sentients other people don't um and I I don't really know much more than that I know like um I mentioned the intersectionality um um movement sorry not intersectionality what's the word anti VI section movement um of the 1870s I mentioned intersectionality because it was that was led by first W feminists so I think one of the leaders of that went on to be in involved or set up the suffrage X I don't know um so it was these kind of like um it was the same people involved in like the suffer jets that were,47
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,50:03,involved in that movement at the time um they kind of working class I guess were probably too busy to um to do much else um yeah sorry if I can't answer any better than that well we've we've already had some uh excellent help from uh chatan so chattan suggests the uh g8's YouTube channel and Alex suggests the work of Erica fudge as a historian explores longer history of where people got their views of animals from and suggest uh also Hilda kean's books for more 19th and 20th Century history thank you thanks for sharing that yeah more things to go and explore uh cashier had a second uh a second question are you aware of any significant differences between the current farmed animal related narratives uh sorry are the current farmed animal related narratives in the UK and other European countries um let me,48
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,51:08,think um I'm not off the top of my head there probably are differences like for example in Britain V I think is pretty much non-existent um that was kind of ified I think in the '90s and then boycotted quite heavily whereas in Spain maybe I think Mediterranean countries it's still quite popular correct me if I'm wrong um yeah I'm more familiar with like the British kind of um narratives to be honest um that's just the context that I'm working in um have to kind of stay somewhat focused unfortunately yeah defin sorry yeah I was just going to say there's definitely a strong like um Great British meat um narrative that you see in advertising a lot I think like as a play on words because the word great is there and it has two meanings like it's great food,49
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,52:11,like good quality as well as it being from Britain and it being related to like your local kind of small F small farmer and yeah that probably exists elsewhere as well yeah I I wonder if the the pastoral idle uh idea is I imagine that's quite um more influential in in Brit and elsewhere we have this this idea of a of a farmer that's very um sort of steeped in British culture that I think probably wouldn't be as as prevalent or as influential elsewhere okay um last question uh from chatan do you feel the animal movement has slowed down since covid-19 I can can only speak for I mean the UK I think um and also just to caveat I went vegan two years ago so it's all quite new to me actually um what I've noticed from my research is it's not a linear progression um so there'll be little,50
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,53:21,spurts of progress and then it'll Plateau um so like I mentioned the first half of the last century like was not really much progress was being made and then 50s and 60s there was like this sudden burst in movement um animal Rising seem to be doing quite well um I don't know we've got other people from ATT here here who have been in the movement longer than I have that probably chip in I I do wonder if the um discourse around xonotic disease um what the um impact of of that is of of that been I wonder if that's potentially um uh affected the the way people relate to animals and the way people relate to animals and human health um I I'm not sure to be honest whether I I imagine it's probably for the worst that it's had an effect because it's yeah I I did just see the a comment something about this is in relation to uh sorry this chat's disappeared for me the relation,51
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,54:32,to the growth of vegans 2% in past 10 years so yeah one slide that I was I did I removed but I was going to include was so up until 2020 because I um up until 2020 there was seemed to be this like exponential increase in veganism and um or it looked that way like if you look at Google Trends of searches for terms like vegan or veganism veganer it sort of exponentially increases Peaks at the start of 2020 and since then it's kind of been declining then and I do wonder if um the pandemic put people into a kind of um crisis mode uh self-preservation mode and that's going to make it difficult to think about like dietary changes and concern for others especially those that are really outside your in group um I imagine that had an impact I don't know any specific studies that have checked for that though it wouldn't surprise,52
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTQIhyPkuc,Looking Back and Looking Forward: Learning from our Narrative Legacy,Animal Think Tank,5 Dec 2023,55:35,me yeah okay we're at time now so thank you very much everybody uh thank you to you as well Rob that we've had a great time we've had some great questions and as Nas's just put in the chat um please connect with us on LinkedIn connect with us on Facebook give us a shout whenever you want to chat or interested in any collaboration or anything like that okay thank you very much everybody thanks everyone,53

Back then I was having nightmares about it. I was a bit scared because I had no idea what was happening around me, the smell was different and strange at the same time. The first animal I slaughtered, I was 16 years old. Not in a slaughterhouse. At home. I was with my father and I had to slaughter a pig. My father was holding the pig down, he gave me the knife,  I stabbed the pig exactly how I saw my father do it and in that moment, I threw the knife away and ran.",1

After doing that for a while, at some point I noticed I didn’t have any feelings about it. My first day in a slaughterhouse was a disaster. All I wanted was to return home as soon as possible. It was terrifying. The smell was horrible. When I saw dead animals and blood and filth, it was sickening. I’ve worked in Romania, Germany, and France. We went straight to work without safety guides, without any training, with nothing. On the first day, at the work station for removing muscles,",2

The most serious work accident I witnessed was a female colleague. She was working in another section, and for some reason, I was there when it happened. She managed to cut off her fingers with a guillotine. There was a machine used for the removal of cows’ hooves. One of my colleagues wasn't paying attention and inserted his hand in this machine, and it crushed his whole hand. It was way too cold. You have to work at -5°C. The temperature doesn’t change.

You can wreck your health. It eats your lungs out. I had to leave the country to earn money, for my family, for my kids. The first time, the living conditions were acceptable. After one year I had left and ended up in Germany. In that place, there were nineteen people in a five-room house.

And I didn’t receive the full 1,600 Euros. I only received 1,000 Euros. From my point of view, I have different opinions regarding the workers. For example, there are lots of people without experience, looking for work in a slaughterhouse. When they leave the country, they are given lots
 of promises, like an exact rate per hour, a place to live,  but after working for a month, some end up without any money to send home. The main problem was that no one would tell you your exact net salary. I was getting paid directly by the intermediary, not by the slaughterhouse. The owner was passing by and a colleague told me who it was. I went and asked him about the pay and he 
told me I should be grateful I still have a job.",5

threatened to send you back to Romania. Some of the workers and the 
coordinators sell drugs to other workers. As far as I know, the management has no idea that this is happening. It affected my health in more than one way. In more than one place, so to speak.  My spine, my cervical spine, my 
shoulders because of the heavy lifting, because of some repetitive movements

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,1:02,instance right but we know this right it's things like economy in the US immigration and health and the US terrorism and money and politics and health care costs these are the big picture issues that most folks are focused on most folks uh you know when it comes to organizational activity these are a lot of the big areas right so the question I really want to open with today is what are you doing here what brings you to this conversation What Makes You Different right um what makes you spending this time at an animal Think Tank webinar and conversation and so I want to specifically ask you know what inspired you to care so much about animals um and from there it's one thing to be inspired it's one thing to you know get this issue on your radar and to have some concern about it but it's tougher to stay committed to that issue over time so what helps you sustain your commitment to the cause I want to give you a second just to think about that what inspired you and what helps you sustain your commitment the cause and my guess is and the argument that I'm going,2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,2:03,to be making in this presentation today is it's probably got something to do with the intersection of it three big picture principles that I'm going to be discussing today so the first is narratives and the stories we tell right so there's probably some story that came to you that shifted the way at some point you think about animals or maybe shaped the way you think about animals to begin with that got you inspired and motivated to care um but there's it's not just about narratives it's not just about stories it's also about networks it's about the connections we forg so my hunch is there are also individuals and organizations that you're connected to that keep you and help you sustain that inspiration over the course of time especially in a world where this is not an issue that most people uh make a primary area of focus and the third piece I'm going to talk about is place the spaces of everyday life what are those physical and digital spaces where you engage with these narratives where you connect with your networks that inspire you that help you sustain your,3

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,5:06,flow of stories between these different Community storytellers was the better outcomes we saw in local communities for things like Civic engagement neighborhood belonging and Community Health and so that Foundation as we'll talk about you'll see sort of big principles here the sort of networks and narratives in place already present in that training that I got I then applied a lot of these Concepts to work that I was doing in LA and other cities across the US uh looking at Food access and what we often refer to as food Justice basically groups using food as a tool to promote Community Economic Development and combat racism and inequality and so that became my dissertation project and my First Book Project more than just food but I've also had this long-term interest in animal issues um and so over the last several years uh this has been work that has sometimes been in parallel to my kind of community-based food activist uh scholarship but also at times intersecting with that work um so I'm going to talk a little bit about some work that I did in collaboration with the non-human rights project which uh advocates for legal rights for,6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,6:09,non-human animals um did some surveys and focus group research that that came out of that that I'll discuss I've also uh my research has been funded by groups like the United States Department of Agriculture and the National Institutes of food and agriculture looking at public perceptions of food and new food technology and meat and meat Alternatives so also draw from some of that both quantitative and qualitative work uh that has looked at some of those issues and then as was already mentioned a little bit um I also you know try to be an academic who engages uh with folks that are actually doing this work on the ground trying to make the world a better place uh for people and for non-human animals and so I write uh you know not just for academic publication but also for you know journalistic out outlets you see a couple uh listed there I think Natalie said she was going to share the link to uh my piece in Vox I also serve as the president of the board for the plant-based Foods Institute which is a nonprofit organization that's advocating for food system change to promote a more plant-based food system in the US and,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,7:10,around the world and so with all of this together um there are a couple kind of key theoretical Frameworks that guide all the work that I do and so I wanted to introduce those F first and then from there talk about a couple specific research projects that put these principles into practice and then wrap up by talking about what does this all mean for folks who are doing doing both scholarship and advocacy and activism uh on animal protection and animal Freedom so the first big picture concept I want to talk about is what's referred to as the socioecological model of communication and behavior change this is a a framework for thinking uh it's very prominent in public health and in communication about how health behavior takes shape and also how we can intervene to change knowledge attitudes and practices related to a variety of issues and the big picture takeaway of models like this is it takes a systems approach to analysis it basically says yes you know individual attitudes and behaviors matter but we can't just understand individuals without understanding the broader context of their social networks of the community,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,8:16,Norms that matter to them of the broader societal Norms in which those operate and nested within the physical environments and infrastructures in in which they live work and play and and a really key Insight of models like this is that higher levels of analysis and higher levels of action here facilitate or constrain change at lowers of lower levels of analysis so what does that mean well it means that if you want to change the behaviors or the attitudes of individuals it's going to be much easier to do much more likely to have a sustainable change if you're also operating at the level of social networks and at community and at society and at the physical environment itself right and so that what we do at these multiple levels of analysis influences everything at a lower level of analysis and so if we're trying to intervene and make social change happen the the most effective approach challenging to do is going to be one that operates at multiple levels that is not just trying to change individuals but it's also trying to,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,9:18,shift networks and communities and societies so that's one big picture theoretical concept that plays a big role in the work that I do another uh comes more from the social ology world the behavioral economics World um and this is about the way our minds work and this might be familiar to folks very famous book uh Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Conan who actually recently passed away but he developed um what is often referred to as the Dual process model of cognition and it basically says that within our mind we kind of have two different brains we have two different modes of thinking and acting uh system one and system two what we often call the automatic system or the deliberative system so the automatic system this is what we use to decide most of our decisions throughout our daily life right it's our automatic effortless impressionistic associative intuitive thinking it's all these puristic and shortcuts that we have in our brain that help shape what we do and why we do it we don't think deeply if we thought,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,10:18,deeply about every single decision we made we would be able to get out of bed in the morning right and so so much of our brain defaults to this automatic system of thinking but we also have this other system of thinking this deliberative model of of thinking it's slower right it constructs thoughts in an orderly series it's effortful it's based on reasoning and is reflective and this way of thinking about how we think also shapes how we intervene and persuade right and so for some issues we might want to see how do we leverage the automatic system how do we change the as we'll talk a little bit later the choice architecture around folks for instance to make the decision that we want them to make the easier decision so they don't have to think much about it um but other issues especially issues that require kind of major changes to our identity and our worldview that is not going to be able to be leveraged through the automatic system that requires us going through this deliberative system right so the the the good news about the deliberative system is if we're able to,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,11:20,really persuade people through that effortful reasoning reflective approach people who change their minds in that way that that that change is likely to be much more sustainable right it's a deeper change but it's harder to appeal to people in that way the automatic system it can be easier to make changes and and get people to you know change their behaviors however it's often based on these shortcuts that are not as as as persistent and so thinking about how automatic systems and deliberative systems work in terms of our mind and in terms of making persuasion and social change happen really Central to the way I approach my work and and and a really major Concept in contemporary social movement studies and and studies of of psychology and social change so with all of that as a kind of theoretical background the socio eological model the two uh modes of thinking I want to introduce kind of three big projects that I've worked on that help us demonstrate these principles in action and with attention as I said to these three concepts that I,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,12:23,think emerge out of these broader theoretical Frameworks so I'm going to talk about the importance of narratives for social change as it pertains to animals and we're going to talk about a research I've done looking at animal categories as a type of story then we're going to talk about networks and I'm going to talk a little bit about the effective altruism community and research that I've done into the effective altruism community and the impact that it's had on the broader animal advocacy Community uh and vice versa what animal advocacy has done to the effective altruism community and then the last little case study I'm going to do is on Choice architecture and dietary change um as you'll see uh these the socioecological model the the different modes of thinking they're going to be kind of coming through in each of these projects um and then as I'm also going to really emphasize it's not about studying these in isolation right the the key argument I'm going to be making today is that if we really want to maximize our potential for social change we need to think about how narratives informed networks informed Place how these things work together and that's going to help us lead to the most,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,13:24,most potential for sustainable social change all right so let's jump in to the first research project that I want to talk about narratives the stories we tell so why narratives well if you're engaged with the work of animal Think Tank you're already familiar with the importance of narratives I think they do a really great job of emphasizing the role that narratives play in our life and in social change um I often go back back to this quote uh by a guy named George gerner a longtime uh professor at the University of Pennsylvania uh who wrote a lot about the the the role of Storytelling and shaping what we know about the world and what action we can take um as he says most of what we know or think we know we've never personally experienced we live in a world erected by stories they weave the Seamless Web of our cultural environment and importantly he he continues to say that who tells the stories of a culture really governs human behavior right so really demonstrating the power that stories play in shaping the way we construct the world around us so what does that mean for Animals well we have lots of different stories we tell about ourselves and our relationship to,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,14:26,animals and different types of animals and so this comes from a survey I conducted as I mentioned a collaboration with the non-human rights project a couple years ago this was a us-based sample and one of the things I asked folks was do you consider yourself an animal lover and this is a term that gets used a lot in the US um and about 75% of the sample said yes I agree with that statement I consider myself an animal lover you see less than 10% of people don't consider themselves an animal lover right so this is a story that a lot of people like to tell themselves right they love animals they care deeply about animals um I even asked some questions more specific to the work of the non-human rights project about legal rights for Animals ask them which of these statements comes closest to their view about the treatment of animals so one option was that animals deserve the exact same rights as people to be free from harm and exploitation 47% of this sample and this has actually been matched pretty closely in some other surveys when you ask this question in this way almost half of the sample,15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,15:23,says animals deserve the exact same rights as people to be free from harm and exploitation the next group also about 4 7% said animals deserve some protection from harm and exploitation but it's still appropriate to use them for the benefit of humans and less than 6% said animals don't need much protection from harm and exploitation since they're just animals right so based on this we would think hey we made we're in a good shape right almost half the the the population in the US thinks animals deserve the exact same rights as people but let's dig a little bit deeper in that same survey what did I find well about 5% of the sample and this matches you know us and UK trend about 5% of the sample identified as vegetarian or vegan with another 6% as a sort of flexitarian right so how do we have 75% of people calling themselves animal lovers 47% of people saying animals deserve the exact same rights as people but only 5% who are choosing not to eat those animals right there's clearly a disconnect here and so this is why I like to do multimethodological research the surveys,16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,16:23,tell us something but interviews and focus groups tell us something interesting as well so I dug deeper into this into some focus group with folks in the states and these are the kinds of things I heard right animals is a very big word there are sort of a lot of categories to animals I don't think you can apply one rule that fits everything it's kind of complex and so the argument I'm going to be making here is that people have different stories about different types of animals about categories of animals and the obligations that we have to those animals and the rights that those animals themselves hold and so I continue to explore this um through some survey research as well working with a colleague uh eser a really great quantitative uh psychologist um and so we did this another survey and we asked people in this survey uh when you think about different types of animals in the world we have different levels of concern we might have different levels of concern for their well-being so we gave them a big list of animals actually included more than the animals you see on your screen right here and we asked them on a scale of one to four how much,17

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,18:25,number it just means they were somewhere around the average right so for this Wildlife group like elephants and whales we saw really high levels of concern some you know statistically significant and folks would tell me things like you know it's wonderful if they can be out in the wild but maybe we're saving them if we have them in the zoo I don't know right but the big picture on this Wildlife group was we want them to have good lives we respect that you know we respect their their right to be free and and wild maybe that you know is best served by them being out in the wild but maybe actually Zeos do a great job of that right people weren't quite sure but the big picture story they were telling was that animals like elephants and whales deserved this kind of protection deserved this right to live in a dignified way they weren't sure whether zoos were the place but they they believe that there was moral concern that should be extended to these types of animals contrast that with chickens Turk turkeys cows pigs animals that folks put in that food and farm category,19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,19:22,here we heard a lot of stories of kind of cognitive dissonance or just stories of trying not to think about these animals at all right this one person said I feel bad about eating pig because the more I learn about the animal the more I realize it's about as intelligent as a dog it makes me feel kind of bad but bacon is delicious right we hear this all the time folks come up with ways to just move animals like pigs and cows and chickens into this food category and so they are able to kind of push their moral concern out so that they're not concerned as they're eating right and can just focus on that they like to eat bacon for some animals we see snakes rats cockroaches spiders um these pest animals for many people as this one person said I don't look at pests like that as animals at all right I don't look at rats and roaches and stuff even though they're animals I don't look at them as animals right so this you know suggests that when we were asking that question before do you think all animals you know deserve the the,20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,20:19,same rights as people for a lot of people what they were telling me is when they looked at that survey question they weren't thinking about some of these you know the animals included in that category as instead a lot of what they were thinking about were companion animals dogs horses caps maybe you know charismatic meapa like elephants um but here we see the stories people tell of companion animals is that you know things like dogs are so in tune to what we go through as humans people don't give them enough credit for their knowledge their feelings their perception about what we go through as humans the stories people tell about these companions is one of Love of companionship of being part of the family often of preferring them to humans at times right and so yes all animals but the stories people tell here are very different right and they're able to create these different animal categories these different stories about where different types of animals fit and within that category what obligations we owe to them what rights they deserve and so what do we do about this right well,21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,21:20,one of the things we see right now is that people have really placed different types of animals into an automatic category right and so this automatic thinking takes hold where they say okay you know chickens they're a food animal and I've got this automatic category here that's what where they live right but we have efforts by groups like animal think tank that are trying to use other types of narratives to change that story right to change the Traditions that we have in terms of where different animals are placed and we know that this is possible because in different cultures and over different periods of time different animals are placed in different categories right horses are you know companions in some places their wildlife in other places their food in other places and so here I go back to another one of my favorite quotes this comes from uh the sociologist Anthony giddens who talks about all Traditions being invented Traditions that have been invented for a diversity of reasons and importantly Traditions evolve over time and can also be quite suddenly altered or transformed they are invented and reinvented so the task here and what,22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,22:25,groups like animal Think Tank are doing is trying to get people to think more deeply right using that deliberative system about the stories they tell about different types of animals with the hopes that one day we can create a new tradition that really expands that moral Circle to include you know more animals automatically in those categories of animals that deserve the types of consideration and protection uh that I know many of us around this call I think uh you all animals deserve right but how do we do that can we do that just by appealing to individuals the argument I'm going to be making here is that individual appeals are valuable but not enough right that we also need to be thinking about individuals as part of broader social networks and communities if we want to make that change stick and so here I move to the second case uh which is exploring networks and the connections that we Forge um why networks well as the biologist Edward O Wilson says human beings are in mesed in social networks like the proverbial fish in the sea we find it difficult to conceive of any place different from,23
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,23:28,this mental environment we have evolved right humans are deeply social creatures deeply embedded in these social networks and so anything related to social change and trying to you know persuade uh and change the story has to take into account what is the story not just among individuals but within broader social networks especially if we're trying to bring forth uh what Damon santola uh communication a scholar and sociologist uh calls complex contagion right uh this more complex approach to changing the way people think and act and behave uh complex contagion are contagion that people resist the key to their success as he notes in his book change looking at specific successful social movements was to have their messages take root in their social network in the right way within clusters of redundant ties here importantly for our purposes more important than the stickiness of the message is the social reinforcement it gets right so you can craft the perect perfect message but if it's not resonating and getting reinforced within a social network that is important to,24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,24:30,someone then it's not going to be effective over time and he contrast this you know between what he calls the complex Network versus the more simple uh Network contagion you know for certain things it's totally fine to have kind of one person or one organization at the center that's kind of blasting out the big messages right this is useful for spreading information quickly but it's not that useful for persuasion especially persuasion that goes against existing social norms instead strong social ties these complex contagions more look look more like this image on the left where there's an abundance of social redundancy trust and intimacy and a foundation for cooperation and solidarity where folks are being exposed to the same Concepts the same Stories the same messages over time by multiple contexts that they trust right not just getting this message from one person having it go out into the world but rather consistently hearing these stories reinforced by contexts that they trust whether they're individuals or their organizations and so a project where I've explored sort of,25
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,25:33,this role of networks in spreading different ways of thinking is by looking at the effective altruism movement and its role within the broader animal protection Community um I published a piece about this going back to 2018 um and I was just at the time really interested to see a bunch of people who I had been involved in animal advocacy for a while but this kind of influx of folks from the effective altruism movement who are starting to have a major role um particularly funding organizations but also as advocates and activists and hearing the sort of stories they were bringing the different ways they were thinking about these issues and seeing it really become a major part of the broader animal protection movement I thought this was really interesting and we can talk we can I could do a whole hour or more just on effective altruism and you know controversial in a lot of ways and I'm not really want to get into too much of that maybe in the Q&A we can talk about that more what I really want to focus on right now is how did effective animal advocacy how did the effective altruism approach the story that they tell becomes such a major part of the broader animal protection movement over the last decade or so um this is something that,26
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,26:36,in an interview Lewis Ballard of the open philanthropy project told me which was you know the most important thing he said is how much good are we doing for Animals if you've ever engaged with effective altruist this is the the the line we hear over and over again right instilling that value saying that's what we really care about for making grants renewing grants everything that's basically a single metric and so what I tried to do in my work on this topic was really catalog like what are the key terms being used by folks in this effective altruism and effective animal advocacy movement I ran a bunch of focus groups with folks who saw themselves at the intersection and kept hearing these key Concepts right like what how much good are we doing for Animals As the key question to ask right which connects to this concept of what they call their importance or the scale of the issue with which they're engaging they also talked a talk a lot about tractability which is can we actually make a difference in this space they also talk about neglected um meaning is there room for more funding is there room for more,27
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,27:37,Advocates and activists in this space right but this importance tractability neglected this framework my guess is if you have been involved in animal protection for more than 10 15 years this was not something that you really engaged with until the effective altruism movement in in these ter in these terms I should say of course you were engaging with these questions I'm sure before but in these terms with this particular very EA utilitarian way of thinking my hunch is that this is something that you've really seen grow in prominence and in influence over the course of the last 10 years and you might be saying yeah well it's because they've got tons of money right and I think that's a big part of it right tons of money big grants from the open philanthropy project um lots of money being moved by animal charity evaluators and other groups like them right to support causes and and organizations that align with the broader effective altruism approach but there's a lot of things that have a lot of money in a lot of places and they don't all take hold they don't all transform movements in the way that I think effective altruism has had a major impact on the uh animal,28
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,28:37,protection and animal Freedom Movement right and so what's going on here well what's going on is that this money is being used to create lots and lots of redundant ties right to through interorganizational collaboration through bringing young activists and Advocates and and and practitioners into these movements who are exposed to the messages and the philosophy of effective altruism bringing that into this broader network of the animal protection Community right we see this through things like animal Charities uh top charity recommendations through the different Animal Welfare funds right and we see also really interesting cross-pollination between the traditional animal protection movement so some of these groups are groups that have been around for a long time not necessarily aligned with effective altruism directly and others are groups that are specifically out of the effective altruism Community it this is that kind of classic complex contagion happening right this me it's not just about the message right it's about how this message gets continually reinforced through multiple redundant interpersonal,29
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,29:38,and interorganizational ties over the course of time you can see this I think uh with a specific example of how the effective altruism movement talks about this concept of wild animal welfare of course animal protection Advocates have been talking about wild animals for a long long time right but EAS uh have this particular way of thinking about it of using a utilitarian calculus in terms of what's you know worthy of supporting in terms of uh activism and action on these issues this comes from a post by uh someone named Evan Gaines Bower on the EA forum and you can see what they're doing is they're basically breaking down how this concept of reducing wild animal suffering has been put forth through these interorganizational networks right some of them specifically from the effective altruism Community like the effective altruism Foundation others that are more focused on animal issues specifically like animal charity evaluators sentients animal ethics right but it's all about these intersecting and reinforcing nodes in these networks that has made this issue and this framing of wild animal,30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,30:42,"welfare from the kind of EA perspective become something that is now part of the broader animal protection universe but also has become part of the effective alism universe so you see an organization like 80,000 hours which advises um people on career paths um you know right now factory farming wild animal suffering not the top top priorities for this group it's below some of these other things like uh Ai and pandemics and nuclear war Etc but we can see you know they also Place factory farming they also Place wild animal suffering as you know priorities that folks might think about going into and so this is again just an example of how these Network effects over time it's not just about the message it's about their redundancy in these networks have shifted the animal protection movement as I'm sure many of you can speak to the way that this EA thinking and narrative has become part of our broader Parliament but also how the animal protection approach has become part of the broader effective altruism movement and we can talk again about where the effective altruism movement is sort of",31
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,31:44,post SBF and all that sort of stuff but I think uh their influence in the animal protection movement is still here um and we can talk about what the implications of that are if folks are interested in Q&A but all of this again I think is also reflecting you know the the socio iCal model right it's not just about appealing to individuals it's also about their social networks it's about their communities and it's also about you know appealing to people with these deliberative you know persuasive arguments but over time it becomes automatic right that now within the animal protection movement some of the EA principles have just become things folks are really familiar with and also within the effective altruism movement animal issues are something that are now considered worthy of consideration uh in ways that they might not have been 10 15 years ago for a lot of people who are in that broader kind of rationalist and uh uh Community right but and another important thing to note here is that all these conversations these Network actions the storytelling they don't happen in outer space right they don't happen in The Ether uh this is a map of effective altruism that Scott Alexander,32
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,32:43,put together um and here he talks about um that he sort of this is more of a conceptual map this is not you know a real map but he notes these very specific places that exist right the good food Institute animal charity evaluator Center for Effective altruism at the intersection between animal welfare and effective altruism Global poverty Etc and one of the things I want to emphasize last here is that these places matter right these places as organizations as digital spaces for convening conversation but also as physical places where people gather and have conversation right so this is kind of the last piece of the puzzle we've talked about narratives we've talked about networks what about the place piece here so place I I call here the spaces of everyday life uh quoting from Yuan who's a a leading thinker and and theorist around uh place and geography and he notes that place has more substance than the word location suggests it's a unique entity a special Ensemble it has history and meaning it incarnates the experiences and aspirations of people right and so Place plays a really key role as sort of the,33
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,33:45,site where our Network action takes shape a and where those narratives can flow through those networks over time and I see this a ton in discussions about dietary change um and the role of choice architecture our spatial environments around our dietary practices this comes from uh some recent focus groups I've been conducting with people about their perceptions of meat and meat Alternatives I just think this is really interesting and speaks to the role that different places with different meanings have on the way people's dietary practices take shape and so this was a guy who was telling me yeah I'm a longtime vegetarian I'm not a strict vegan or vegetarian though right so when he's at home I cook for myself it's all vegan but when I'm out with other people I'll eat the kind of food that they like right and I just don't really talk about it people are kind of surprised by this right so this guy's vegan at home but not vegan when he goes outside with other people right um but still identifies as vegan right so it doesn't totally make sense necessarily but for for me this proves like Place,34
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,34:43,really matters right the meanings of these different places shape the way this person thinks about themselves and the way their dietary practices move forward another example this was an older gentleman in the UK who talked about having three daughters the oldest turned vegetarian then over time other daughters were vegetarian his wife was vegetarian and so at home it's vegetarian right and he still likes the taste texture flavor of a bacon sandwich of a burger but at home in that place that has that meaning right connected to that social network of his of his family the stories that they've told about the importance of vegetarianism the importance of animals in that place he's vegetarian mostly vegan but outside of that place he's something else and so where do we get you know how do we understand this well there's been a ton of scholarship in the last couple decades on on what's called Choice architecture the famous book by ther and sunstein nudge um who talks about the parallels between traditional architecture and choice architecture and the big idea the is that there's no such thing as a neutral design that small and,35
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,35:43,apparently insignificant details can have major impacts on people's behavior and we should assume that everything matters when it comes to shaping the places in which we engage and this has been put into practice in a variety of different areas um and we're going to talk about around dietary Choice specifically uh here you know there's a big emphasis on the automatic system of thinking right how can we change environments how can we change Choice architecture such that it makes the simple easy thing to do to nudge them into the choice we want them to make right and it also of course connects to the socioecological model how do we shift that physical environment shift those Community Norms in ways that make what we're trying to do the easy thing to do and so we've seen this put into practice in a big way in things like dining services this is actually not a project that I was a part of but I think it's instructive and I'll talk a little bit about some of the work that I'm doing around this now but this comes from the better food foundation and the food and climate league and they did this randomized control trial at three different University dining Halls uh,36
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,36:43,tane Lehi and RPI rensler polytechnical Institute and they had a couple different conditions right one was plant default days where only a plant-based dish was presented but students could ask for meat if they you know if they asked the staff and then the control days where plant and plant-based and meat dishes were served side by side and so what did they find well they found some real influence of choice architecture on control days about 27% of dishes served were plant-based that went all the way up to almost 58% on those plant-based by default dates but they noted this was pretty much all explained by what happened at two of the schools Tain and Lehigh it went from 30 30.8% of dishes served plant-based on the control days all the way up to 80 1.5% of the dishes served on plant-based days were plant-based right so to me that's interesting what succeeded what's even more interesting to me is what failed right what went wrong at RPI and they note that unlike Tain and Lehi the proportion of plant-based dishes served at RPI remained unchanged between control and plant default days right so,37
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,37:47,this says hey maybe it's not just about shifting environments maybe it's not just about changing Choice architecture what else is going on there and if you read a little closer they basically say that the staff wasn't bought in right the staff was not consistently putting this intervention into place they were kind of in in s ways kind of nudging folks away from the plant-based dishes uh they weren't bought in through that social network of the staff who were really key here the story had not permeated right the story that this matter that this had value had not become a part of the culture right so yeah CH architecture matters here but Choice architecture AB absent culture buyin it's not going to have the impact what we saw at the places where it worked well was cultural buyin through those social networks of folks that mattered right in that place that combined makes the change happen and so I'll just say sort of briefly as I move towards a a bit of a conclusion here I'm working right now I also have this role as a a fellow at my University focused on sustainability and right now I'm working through uh something called the,38
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,38:50,Stars program which is a sustainability tracking assessment and rating system created for colleges and universities to measure sustainability performance and there's a bunch of different categories from the academics to operations campus and public engagement and coordination and planning and within operations there's a big area for uh food and beverage purchase right and institutions can get points and once you get points you get these different uh different ratings and there's actually a big Network effect here and something I'm trying to convince my Administration right look at all the schools we're competing with and comparing oursel to can we compete with that you know that Network and get this story more broadly throughout University and so right now I'm trying to figure out how do I approach this within our dining services to prioritize more purchases of plant-based foods to shift the choice architecture and just a kind of key idea here is yes we need to change that choice architecture but I also need to make sure that anybody involved in that process understands the story is bought into that story that that's resilient across that social network only if the,39
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,39:51,narratives and the networks align with the changes to the place right that those meanings make sense in those Choice architectural environments that's the way we can maximize success without one of those elements one or more of those elements we're going to see failure in these kinds of interventions so I know that was a ton uh in a bit of Professor broad mode here right kind of putting out lots of big Concepts taking you through some of my research projects that demonstrate these uh Dynamics and action and so I just want to summarize with what are what are some the key takeaways and what can you use in your own work whether you're doing uh advocacy or direct action Act activism or even scholarship in this area what can we learn from some of these principles about changing the world for animals so the first big one I want to reemphasize is that ecological models show us that interventions are most effective when they address these multiple levels of analysis right the individual The Social Network the community and the societal so anything that we can do to intervene across multiple levels and making sure that the higher levels are helping to enable the,40
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,40:55,actions that we want to see put forth whether it's in what people think or how people behave that's going to be really effective there also ecological models also show us that the interventions are most effective when they're leveraging both the automatic and the deliberative thinking right have to identify what needs this more reflective uh you know identity-based persuasion and what can be accomplished by these more shortcut charistics and how do we move these identities into the automatic thinking in a way uh that is more uh supportive of animal well-being the next piece is that narrative Theory shows us that people understand the world via stories they tell and it also demonstrates that Traditions are invented and they can be reinvented so a big task for all of us is to figure out how do we change the story how do we reinvent our traditions in ways that provide greater respect for all animals the next one is that social network Theory shows that movements spread via complex contagion and they gain traction when key messages are reinforced by multiple social contexts we can't think about social change as just something that happens among a,41
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,41:59,bunch of disconnected individuals Network effects matter and the more we can do to reinforce these stories that we want to be told across multiple nodes within that Network in a way that reinforces makes those messages more sticky make social social change more possible and the final piece is that theories of place show that we give meanings to the spaces we inhabit both physical and digital and so we need to think about how do we shape and reshape our choice architecture to promote the kind of behaviors we want but we need to make sure as well that we're combining that with culture change to transform local Norms without that cultural element the choice architecture will not be nearly as effective so ecological models narratives networks and place these are some of the principles that have guided the research that I've done and some of the applied engaged work that I've done with movements for food system change and animal well-being I hope you find them useful I'm sure some of these are are concept A lot of these are concept that you're probably already working with but hopefully this provides a little bit of a kind of uh you know,42
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,42:59,academic terminology that might help us understand what's going forth but of course I'd also love to hear from you you know what resonates with you what doesn't quite make sense here um but thank you so much uh for taking the time to be part of this conversation uh and thank you for the work that you're doing uh to change the world for animals so I'll leave it there and look forward to continuing the conversation thanks everybody thanks gar that was amazing I'm really glad we recorded that because I'm sure everyone will want to watch it again because there's so much richness to that so thank you so much got lots of um messages coming through I might be cheeky and ask a question first um just thinking about your brilliant rocks article and the link is in there for others to read in the chat and I know yeah you were talking about how um there's these animal categories and you've mentioned before about how we kind of need to dismantle those categories and kind of blare those categories I wondered if you could speak a bit more to that and approaches for that yeah so I think there's a couple things right one of the things that we often see,43
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,43:57,is that personal experience plays a huge role right and so you know I think we've all seen this also in media right um you know the stories of of of pigs that people get to know right of dogs that of making that connection between what's in their dinner plate and uh you know and what is you know what they consider to be a companion or a friend um and so that's that's something how do we you know one engage people in closer interactions with animals particularly farmed animals and things like I think can have a really big role you know I know like Farm sanctuaries play this role here the challenge with a thing like a Farm Sanctuary of course is that you can only get the folks who are coming through the Farm Sanctuary and so I think there's a lot of work as well trying to use more Creative Media storytelling to get those stories out more publicly and I think we have seen some impact of things uh like you know some of these charismatic stories of you know pigs that have become adopted and become part of the family and things like that and so yeah that direct person experience um really makes a a key,44

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,46:08,are humans are IM meshed in social networks as I said right we look to our social norms around us it's really difficult to go against that grain and so when we feel like we're not alone in this process I mean I don't know about you but I've been the only vegan at the barbecue before right and and that's hard to do it takes a particular type of Personality particular stubborn type person like me um right to be able to go up against those norms and so what can we do to build those Community networks to help people build those connections and so I think there's a lot of good work happening in the broader animal movement to build those connections build that accountability uh have that social support so those would be probably the two biggest things one those direct experiences that just kind of change things and those can be direct experiences with animals or mediated experiences and then also this ongoing social support huge huge predictor of what makes change sustainable amazing thanks Garrett um we have a few questions coming in so um got one from Alex he said at Viva we had 45,46

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,48:16,women um that that is is a big piece of this um and so I I think you know any communication strategy requires an understanding of your audience and devel in messages that resonate with that audience and so it's a challenge though right because you want to do it while maintaining a value set that is consistent with your broader approach so I know you know I think about like the game changers movie for instance um if if folks have seen which the basic idea the basic thesis behind this was yeah all the vegetarians are women that's an oversimplification right but if you've heard the people who made that movie um you know that's kind of how they say it right so we wanted to make this kind of manly movie that shows you can be a strong dude and you can be a vegetarian right and I think yeah there is some value in that kind of micr targeting but I also know it gets a lot of blowback from folks who say hey this is reinforcing some of these patriarchal Norms that many of us come to this movement to resist to begin with right and I think that's a really valid and,48
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,49:15,legitimate critique um I would just say you know you kind of have to as an organization figure out like what what what are you trying to do here right are you trying to activate the group that is most likely to pay attention right and if so um you can kind of lean on that that initial group um that that you've already hearing from and figure out how do you target them who are The Messengers and the and the me messaging platforms that make most sense there um or are you trying to widen the net right are you're trying to have a broader appeal are you trying to have an appeal to a group that's a little harder to reach I mean big picture you know what matter matters a lot is always you know does the message resonate with them but also are the sources that they're hearing it from trusted on that issue in particular and then I think the reason we see clusters of teenage girls for instance is because it's being reinforced in their social network right and so we can't expect that just one you know influencer is going to do the trick right it has to be sustained contact over time through different elements of,49
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,50:16,their broader social network and so making sure that you have you know kind of kind of influencers at different different in different places of the networks that you're trying to reach them that's going to be a way to reach beyond that kind of you know easiest to reach to get to some of the harder reach groups I hope that answers your question but happy to chat further later if you'd like yeah just a reminder for everyone we've got a after hour session straight after this and I put the link in the chat so we'll have another half hour with Garrett I'm recorded people can ask questions um Natalia I'll um you should be able to unmute yourself I think to ask your question hopefully uh yeah thank you um effective alism bases itself self on utilitarianism I personally don't go for it for various reasons that we may or may not go into uh but basically if you happen to consider utilitarianism not a valid philosophical position if your thing is either virtue ethics or deontology where do you go from that is there a kind of an equivalent based on a different philosophical system within,50
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,51:19,the movement broadly I think certainly right and and my you know my goal here was not to say that the EA way is the way for the movement right um and I saw some you know notes in the chat that we could you know would love a whole other EA conversation and I don't know if other folks might be it's uh at Ava I'll be at Ava um the animal and vegan advocacy Summit coming up I know some folks might be making the trip there um maybe I know there's some EA sessions and things like that I think it's a really interesting interesting movement that has some I think there's been some value that's been brought by that movement but I've also uh for many years had some critiques of it uh that I think have come to the four in the last couple years if we we've seen a sort of in crisis moment um but I would say in general in the movement Natalya um you know utilitarian is is certainly not the only way to think about things um and that many folks are are driven by a more you know as you say kind of virtue ethics driven approach uh uh you know a more kind of Conan ethics approach as opposed to the utilitarian ethics I think my point was more to say that you know the utilitarian Strand and Peter,51
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,52:21,Singer probably being the like philosophical you know leader of that branch of the animal movement movement and and his work obviously super influential in the EA movement that's always been a part of the broader animal protection movement but I think with EA and the way that it has constructed these networks over time um and of course because of the funding it's got behind it I think it's made this utilitarian way of thinking even stronger in the movement and even bigger part of the movement over the last decade than it was before that so yeah I mean how do you combat that if you're trying to put forth a different type of approach um I mean my my general philosophy on that is that you know there's plenty of room for Action um and that uh you know my general philosophy is that that that I support folks trying to make make a difference um and so would love to see lots of organizations offering alternative messaging approaches alternative ways of of defining what value looks like and how we evaluate that value um but certainly I don't think utilitarianism is the only way and I certainly don't think the ea uh approach is the only way but my my,52
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,53:22,main point was just to say you know the way that they've cultivated networks has been uh really influential piece of of our broader movement it's worth figuring out and reflecting on how they got to that that point hope that's somewhat useful in Natalia happy to happy to chat further thanks gar and got another question from isidora asking are there any study groups for um people to join with specific Focus um on these subjects um isor I don't know if you want to unmute yourself and ask your question directly otherwise I can ask it for you but yeah just um a story works from an NGO and she said it' be useful to gather and brainstorm so Garrett yeah any study groups but yeah so there are a couple that come to mind um I go to uh something called recap um which I believe is technically uh I'm trying to find as I'm talking I'm Googling which is something you're never supposed to do in these kinds of things so there's this group uh re recap research to end uh animal food production if there's anybody in the chat who maybe has a link um uh that would help that is a I think an,53
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,54:23,interesting group oh I did find it okay uh so I'll put this in the chat so this is a group that I that meets monthly um to talk about a group of social science researchers from Academia research institutes and NOS who share the goal of ending Animal product consumption so it definitely has more of a focus on the food side of the movement um but it's been a place where I've definitely seen some really interesting presentations a lot of Works in progress and a cool combination of folks who come from this from a more academic perspective but also research that's coming out of um you know uh out of out of NGS uh themselves um so might be one place to start and I would also just say that you know always looking to chat more with folks who are interested in the research side I think one of the things we have seen in recent years is a bigger focus on Research within the nonprofit uh you know Community um and really thinking I think animal think tanks a great example of this right really thinking about like what are the foundational theories that are bringing to the this work and then how do we evaluate the effectiveness of this work um and how do we even Define,54
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_LF7RgzEc,"Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks and Place",Animal Think Tank,24 Apr 2024,55:22,something like Effectiveness I I think is an important question to ask as well but I would say you know a lot of NOS themselves I think are doing you know producing a lot of really good work here so um if you don't have a a group within your within your group that's thinking about research maybe maybe a good place to start but I also think um something like this uh this convening these webinars are another great space for these conversation these conferences uh that I've mentioned you know one that I'll be at soon bring together a lot of researchers so I think the opportunity to kind of have conversations about research and the movement is you know I've been doing work around this stuff for almost 20 years at this point um 15 20 years at this point and I think we're in a much better place in terms of thinking about the research side than we were uh going back to when I first got interested in these things but happy to talk more Isadora about ways we might keep you connected to the research site brilliant thanks Garrett that's all we have time for in this main session so thanks everyone for joining I'll put the link in the chat for the after hour session where we can um chat more intimately and recorded and just to say,55

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP7mvvnCvOk,Do Fish Matter? | Becca Franks,Generation Vegan,31 Jul 2023,1:11,are caught in the wild and shipped all over the world for home aquariums the scale and the scope of of the problem with fish is really sort of off the charts so it became not only something that I was interested in but also like a very urgent problem that we're facing and in particular the fish are facing [Music],4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP7mvvnCvOk,Do Fish Matter? | Becca Franks,Generation Vegan,31 Jul 2023,1:41,it's almost half if not more than half of the fish who are being eaten globally are coming from aquaculture and not being caught in the wild and that is in large part because the wild has been so depleted there's so few fish left in the ocean [Music] there's hundreds of species involved and yet it's being undertaken and expanded,5

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IktlJk_nZsA,Live Pitch at ProVeg's Kickstarting for Good Incubator - Open Paws,Open Paws,30 Jan 2024,3:42,unlimited potential for developers activists and animal rights organizations to continue training this AI further and adapting it to their own specific needs so not only do we give the animal rights movement a really powerful tool for advocacy but we open the doors to it being cheaper faster and easier to train more and more tools on top of it but again our impact doesn't,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IktlJk_nZsA,Live Pitch at ProVeg's Kickstarting for Good Incubator - Open Paws,Open Paws,30 Jan 2024,4:07,stop there either when we're talking about AI just within the animal race Movement we also are in discussions with major AI Labs like Google oh sorry I got ahead of myself all right so we're also going to be offering that customization as a free service to some of the most impactful nonprofits for example with the freedom food Al life we're going to be working closely with them to create,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IktlJk_nZsA,Live Pitch at ProVeg's Kickstarting for Good Incubator - Open Paws,Open Paws,30 Jan 2024,4:32,AI to identify misinformation in the animal industry and to respond to it and now where I was getting ahead of myself so we've already begun discussions with major AI Labs like Google deepmind and anthropic and have received early indications that they are actually open to collaborating to make their models more animal friendly we've also uh from one of these organizations,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IktlJk_nZsA,Live Pitch at ProVeg's Kickstarting for Good Incubator - Open Paws,Open Paws,30 Jan 2024,4:57,been specifically invited to write a written report on the biases we find in the system and how we can help solve it so to put this in concrete terms the first thing we need to do is to collect that data and campaign material from animal rights organizations which we will start uh at the beginning of this coming year once we've collected enough data we will use it to train and release,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IktlJk_nZsA,Live Pitch at ProVeg's Kickstarting for Good Incubator - Open Paws,Open Paws,30 Jan 2024,5:20,an open source artificial intelligence Bing this we work closely with nonprofits to B tune it to their use cases and we will also use that data that we collected especially the human feedback on the impact of AI responses on animals in order to help at least one major AI lab make their AI more animal friendly by far the biggest cost that we,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IktlJk_nZsA,Live Pitch at ProVeg's Kickstarting for Good Incubator - Open Paws,Open Paws,30 Jan 2024,5:47,"have in achieving this goal is the actual compute costs themselves it's very expensive to train an artificial intelligence on large amounts of data but we have a really exciting opportunity to dramatically reduce these costs thanks to Google's AI for startups Grant they offer $350,000 worth of free cloud computing credits and all we need in order to",15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IktlJk_nZsA,Live Pitch at ProVeg's Kickstarting for Good Incubator - Open Paws,Open Paws,30 Jan 2024,6:10,"unlock those credits is an investment from an accredited investor so whilst they don't offer that for nonprofit if we receive a small even token investment in our for-profit Branch we could actually do everything we need to do with only $150,000 to get $500,000 worth within that so if you're interested in funding this high impact opportunity or you",16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IktlJk_nZsA,Live Pitch at ProVeg's Kickstarting for Good Incubator - Open Paws,Open Paws,30 Jan 2024,6:36,simply want to explore the intersection of AI and animal advocacy further please get in touch with me if you believe like I do that with the help of AI we will achieve animal Liberation within our lifetimes thank [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music],17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IktlJk_nZsA,Live Pitch at ProVeg's Kickstarting for Good Incubator - Open Paws,Open Paws,30 Jan 2024,6:58,you and this is Maddie my partner both from the nonprofit and life okay any questions I have a question forgive me because I'm not super technical but why are you creating another AI rather than focusing on getting AIS that a lot of people have signed up to and retraining that one to make it more animal,18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IktlJk_nZsA,Live Pitch at ProVeg's Kickstarting for Good Incubator - Open Paws,Open Paws,30 Jan 2024,7:30,so both of those approaches are things that we're going to do and they both rely on the same step of collecting the data so the way that you train biases out of AI systems that's most commonly used is a technique called reinforcement learning from Human feedback so to put that in simple terms you just give people some AI responses and you tell them rank it in terms of is this harmful,19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IktlJk_nZsA,Live Pitch at ProVeg's Kickstarting for Good Incubator - Open Paws,Open Paws,30 Jan 2024,7:49,to animals is it not harmful to animals so we have to collect that data both to train our own model and to uh have an impact in terms of other AI systems so because we're already collecting that data then we're going to maximize it by simultaneously using that for both purposes um uh just to kind of help me understand so the AI that you're building what would that like tangibly,20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IktlJk_nZsA,Live Pitch at ProVeg's Kickstarting for Good Incubator - Open Paws,Open Paws,30 Jan 2024,8:15,look like if it look like something like chat gbt like again I'm not very technical so yeah how how um would myself potentially let use it yeah so imagine something like chat GPT but that understands everything there is to know about effective animal advocacy and it's using that to actually give you responses on top of that there's another type of model we you can build called,21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IktlJk_nZsA,Live Pitch at ProVeg's Kickstarting for Good Incubator - Open Paws,Open Paws,30 Jan 2024,8:40,predictive models so what uh you're familiar with Chad gbt with that's generative AI but we can also train predictive AIS for example if we have a lot of data on different digital media campaigns for example we have a lot of data on how things uh affect dietary change you can actually train a predictor model based on that data and then we can also train the generative,22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IktlJk_nZsA,Live Pitch at ProVeg's Kickstarting for Good Incubator - Open Paws,Open Paws,30 Jan 2024,9:03,model on that predective model so it's a little hard to get your head around know so apologize for that but essentially what it means is you could actually be training the model on the specific goal that you're looking for as opposed to General tools which are just trained on like guess the next word and how it would usually appear on the internet we can actually train something that's goal,23
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IktlJk_nZsA,Live Pitch at ProVeg's Kickstarting for Good Incubator - Open Paws,Open Paws,30 Jan 2024,9:28,focused and that's why we think that this will outperform human Advocates because it will be able to consider so much more data than any human could and it'll be able to optimize um for the results in a way that humans wouldn't actually be able to do ourselves it's also worth noting that our full profit business is already like a vegan version of something like chat gbt and so the,24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IktlJk_nZsA,Live Pitch at ProVeg's Kickstarting for Good Incubator - Open Paws,Open Paws,30 Jan 2024,9:49,main difference with the nonprofit is the fact that it's open source yes exactly you can probably explain more about Open Source anyway anyone needs any last questions um so uh just just following up so so for people like me in the movement who don't uh know about AI very well or know how to use it how are you planning,25
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IktlJk_nZsA,Live Pitch at ProVeg's Kickstarting for Good Incubator - Open Paws,Open Paws,30 Jan 2024,10:16,to I guess like train the movement or or help people to understand how to use this and how to yeah that's an excellent question so one of the first steps is obviously collecting the data so during that process we're going to be working very intimately with groups to understand what problems it is they need to solve and we're also going to be actually providing the technical support,26
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IktlJk_nZsA,Live Pitch at ProVeg's Kickstarting for Good Incubator - Open Paws,Open Paws,30 Jan 2024,10:38,to implement these systems and those specific workflows so again because of the for-profit business what we're running is like a software as a service so we're very experienced with building things in intuitive ways for users so yeah we will have like the model itself that people can you know obviously download and developers can build it into things but we will also be creating,27
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IktlJk_nZsA,Live Pitch at ProVeg's Kickstarting for Good Incubator - Open Paws,Open Paws,30 Jan 2024,11:00,uh you know intuitive interfaces for users as well thank [Applause] you,28

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh5e0e2BXwg,The Importance of Protein in a Vegan Diet,Generation Vegan,11 Dec 2023,0:24,a big and loud rooster and you know I huged him and um I just love this little guy one day when I went there open the door you know he's not there and I asked my grandma you know where he's happy she says oh sorry you know he ran away the door was left open and I felt like he betrayed me because I was like he loved me so much he would never leave and you know lived with that thought that this,2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh5e0e2BXwg,The Importance of Protein in a Vegan Diet,Generation Vegan,11 Dec 2023,0:51,you know lovely chicken left me until like 10 years later my mom said the chicken soup we had that night you know the crazy thing is I knew that I had chicken it was just like knowing that it wasn't that one chicken that I care about so that shows the the you know cognitive dissonance that when we care for a one animal we get really emotionals and I think a lot of people,3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh5e0e2BXwg,The Importance of Protein in a Vegan Diet,Generation Vegan,11 Dec 2023,1:17,can sympathize with that because they care about their animal their uh pets their dogs or whatever they would never put down a dog humanely just to eat them you know when you look up the word human in dictionary it means Act of compassion and kindness so an example of killing someone humanely is when you put down a dog who's sick and old and you do that because you're trying to be kind to them,4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh5e0e2BXwg,The Importance of Protein in a Vegan Diet,Generation Vegan,11 Dec 2023,1:42,you're trying to reduce their suffering but when you kill an animal because a healthy animal who wants to live just because you like the taste of their flesh and body part that's anything but Humane and kind and compassion I think I always loved animals just like a lot of other people except that there was this cognitive dis an uh that you know I didn't care about animals that I ate I'm,5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh5e0e2BXwg,The Importance of Protein in a Vegan Diet,Generation Vegan,11 Dec 2023,2:04,ashamed to say that when my friend came to me and said you know FR us you can say you love animals and eat them too uh what I thought was sorry animals I love meat so much is meat a good source of protein yes but it's not a good way to get your protein it comes with a lot of bad things so getting your proteins from meat is like getting your potassium from like coke coke has a lot of pottassium,6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh5e0e2BXwg,The Importance of Protein in a Vegan Diet,Generation Vegan,11 Dec 2023,2:28,but it comes with a lot of sugar so when you can get it from healthy plant sources why would you want to harm an animal and eat something that is going to increase the risk of a lot of other diseases bad for the environment and we know all of that what really changed for me is just the amount of suffering involved just putting yourself in place of animals and knowing that it's not,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh5e0e2BXwg,The Importance of Protein in a Vegan Diet,Generation Vegan,11 Dec 2023,2:53,even one animal it's like over a trillion animal the numbers is bigger than anything we can imagine the depth and an amount of torture like I I felt oppression in my life a lot but none of that comes close to experience of one day of a you know one pig or one chicken it just doesn't even come close to that a lot of people are like borderline vegan they they've thought about it they,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh5e0e2BXwg,The Importance of Protein in a Vegan Diet,Generation Vegan,11 Dec 2023,3:18,want to make a change but you know they're literally waiting for someone to come to their life and say hey do it already what got me active uh to begin with despite being so you know shy and introvert was the fact that um I just know that this is something I have to do it's not about what's easy for me it's not about what I want to do it's about what I need to do so I think that's,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh5e0e2BXwg,The Importance of Protein in a Vegan Diet,Generation Vegan,11 Dec 2023,3:40,really important so put yourself in their place and see it from their perspective if it was happening to you how urgently would you want that to stop the only way that we can change this world is by a group of dedicated and uh educated and compassionate and passionate activist be one of them you know veganism is the bare minimum that we can do but remember that in the face,10

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,7:19,harms we measured this is a very conservative estimate so it's the minimum time in pain or percentage of time in pain expected to be diverted for every lane hand and the reasons for being conservative are discussed in these books also uh in the case of Broiler chickens uh we also have here uh time in let's see if I can get a marker okay so timing annoying pain for fast growing and slower growing breeds hurtful disabling and excruciating excruciating is in seconds and here we have days and what we found is that adoption of slower goinging breeds expect Ed to reduce time in hurtful disabling and excruciating pain by at least 2466 and 78% respectively not so much time in uh annoying ping again this is a very conservative uh estimate and uh the reasons for being conservative includes not uh being open to criticism by uh the industry so uh as,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,8:27,you can see our final estimates are are are given in four different uh using four different metrics timing annoying pain hurtful pain disabling pain and excruciating pain and even though for most of the situations we analyzed this is okay because all the results go in the same direction so when you reduce pain in in one level you typically reduce you reduce pain uh in in the other uh category of intensity as well there might be cases in which you have a more difficult tradeoff that you have uh brief intense pain and long more moderate pain also it could be more practical to have just a single metric so that you could have measures of the cast effectiveness of the interventions the the cost benefit of the interventions and and so on so why don't we do it well before uh going that why don't why why we do not integrate the,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,9:30,four categories of pain intensity into a single final measurement or estimate of suffering one way to go about it would be analyze the difference in terms of aversiveness caused by the different levels of pain intensity and they how they can be offset by different durations for example here I have uh excruciating pain and disabling pain so in this case time spent in both levels is the the same uh so it's obvious that excruciating pain here the cause of excruciating pain is worse now what if the time spent in disabling pain is longer are they still is excruciate is the event leading to excruciating pain still worse is it like worth it to to mitigate it instead of disabling pain and what if the timeing disabling pain is even longer and longer what is the time that makes these two levels of,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,10:31,intensity equivalent if we could know that we would be able to to integrate the different levels of intensity into one so let's say that one minute of excruciating pain is equivalent to 100 minutes in disabling pain so we could multiply uh time in excruciating pain by 100 to have a metric of disabling equivalent pain for ex example so uh using this table here and just a very simple example uh using just hurtful disabling and excruciating pain just a note we don't think annoying pain is really decision relevant it's just very mild discomfort uh so focusing on only on the more uh intense pain levels let's say and this is just hypothetical uh that using disabling pain as a reference and estimating the time in disabling equivalent pain was the time needed to make the experience,11

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,12:42,hours uh why why don't we do it why don't we integrate and have a measure like of intense suffering like like in this example here well for a number of reasons actually we tried this in the end uh in 2018 we had a pilot project with pigs uh and we converted all the metrics to disabling equivalent pain uh one hour of disabling equivalent pain but uh following that project we gave up that idea for a number of reasons that we're going to be discussing here so uh there's virtually no knowledge data or evidence on what would be the equivalence of the intensities and how they should be integrated so how much worse is excruciating pain comparing to disabling or how much worse even if not our categories are used per intense pain compared to more moderate pain is or more moderate pain compared to more M milder pain so there is uh surprisingly,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,13:45,to our surprise there hasn't been uh really research on this topic another reason is more of a philosophical nature uh in the sense that it's unclear to to which when you're analyzing populations if it's valid to balance different intensities of suffering across individuals for so for example can extreme suffering in a few individuals be balanced oh sorry be balanced be compensated by milder suffering in a lot of individuals because if we were to do this integration we could end up with measures of cumulative timing pain or disabling like pain that were the same for a population with a lot of mild suffering and no intense suffering against the population with few individuals suffering a lot but most individuals not suffering for example so can we do it is it is it valid so we we are not sure uh the disaggregated estimates also,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,14:51,can be traced back to evidence for for every uh estimate of timing annoying pain hurtful and so on we can go back to evidence and show why that's the case the type of challenges the animal suffered How likely they are to be of that intensity and how long they last Etc if we have disabling like pain it's it's much more uh difficult and it's more difficult for for the general public or any audience to understand what is disabling like pain because you lose reference to the actual realities of the animal you're going to have timing disabling pain that is made up of a lot of timing just annoying pain or a much shorter time in excruciating pain so we don't know exactly what we are talking about in and in that sense we prefer to keep everything uh traced back to evidence to the realities of the animals and also uh because once we have the estimates for,15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,15:55,the four levels of intensity different organizations different individuals can make this integration can attribute weight to the different intensities and uh based on on their values on what they want to maximize so they let's say they want to maximize the mitigation of only very intense suffering so they can focus on estimates of excruciating pain disabling pain or they want to to to mitigate some different type of suffering so they can do it so they don't have that integrated uh measure and this can be done also considering the species the context of the analysis Etc so the fact that we don't integrate doesn't prevent uh organizations and individuals to integrate the uh estimates okay but there are some situations in which we need to decide if uh we should go for the alleviation of more intense but brief suffering such as in the case of Slaughter or poorly uh conducted stunning practices or more,16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,17:02,moderate but longer lasting suffering as in the case of lameness of crowding stress Etc thermal stress Etc that is endured for for a very long time and uh just I just wanted to mention and and will is is here and we can discuss that in the um questions later on that uh um rethink priority priorities organized a workshop last year to discuss possibilities experimental possibilities to try to address this question on how to determine how much more aversive a given level of intensity is compared to a lower level of intensity or what is more important intensity or duration what would be experimental paradig paradigms that could be used to address this question and briefly uh uh we couldn't come up and the group of people there couldn't come up with any definitive solution there are number of uh problems with different experimental uh paradigms also it's very hard to replicate the conditions that farmed,17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,18:10,animals experience uh in the farms in uh in an experimental setting in the laboratory there's also a difficulty in the sense that it's hard to rely on the preferences of animals or on the way they behave because they may not maximizing their overall welfare over a longer time frame of course they will not prefer and they would try to avert at all costs in 10 Spain in 10 Spain they were selected for this but that doesn't mean that that reaction reflects the best um uh course of action for or or or or is maximizing overall welfare so it's very hard to to devise a situation sitation in which we can um have an answer to to this question uh okay so in this session uh I will having taking this into account in this session the idea is to see using,18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,19:15,studies in humans because humans uh are able to self-report their pain and their preferences and their experiences use reports from humans to try to understand what is worse brief intense suffering or longer lasting but more moderate suffering uh also insights from people who are suffering the pain at the time that the research is being uh conducted they are self-reporting the pain as it happens uh evidence from psychophysics also in humans to see if uh there is any clue that we can use with the animals the challenges uh of of addressing this problem also using the data from humans and how we should go about it uh once we consider these challenges so in the case of human preferences uh there has been a number of studies in global health for example in which uh the aversiveness of different human conditions are uh are,19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,20:16,are investigated different diseases for example and there are different ways to assess this but one of the ways which is particularly useful for us is to understand the time that people would tray from perfect health to avoid a condition so let's say a severe case of cancer perhaps people would trade 10 years of healthy life to avoid one year of severe cancer uh but in the case of an infection or a flu they would trade half an year or a week of healthy like healthy life to avoid that case of flu based on those answers then we can can try to estimate the degree of Avers aversiveness of different conditions mild moderate and severe and then how they can be compensated by withstanding a longer time in one or a shorter time in another uh and what we find from these studies is that the aversiveness of pain of unpleasant experiences increases,20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,21:24,super linearly with intensity so when you go from mild to moderate pain you have an increase in intensity and but from moderate to severe pain the increase is much much larger so there is a great much disproportionately greater aversion to pain that is more severe so in our case excruciating pain would be much much worse in relation to disabling pain then disabling pain is in relation to hurtful pain the problem with this uh uh research is that this estimates in humans are derived not only from the effective experience of pain but also by considering many things that this diseases that this health States uh entail such as lack of Mobility functioning self- care Etc and many of the uh perceptions are associated with cultural and social aspects that are not relevant to animals so we cannot,21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,22:26,extrapolate directly from that and also most of this is using participants that judge the states without having experience in the states so there are number of biases that may emerge from this there's also uh some research by the qualia research uh Institute on uh Pleasure and Pain and I encourage you to go to to their web page and and have a look and they also found something similar that the aversiveness of pain increases super linearly with intensity so for example when they ask participants uh to rate their worst uh uh experienced pain as compared to their second worst ex worst pain experience what they found was not that the aversiveness of the painful event events increased linearly with the intensity but disproportionately for uh more uh intense events so cluster,22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,23:31,headaches for example where judges extremely more unpleasant than uh more unpleasant than amputation which was not so much more unpleasant than chronic back pain so as you go from myot to moderate to severe the aversiveness of that increases disproportionately which would uh let us lead us to the conclusion that you need much more time in in milder formers mild milder forms of pain to compensate for a brief intense pain so you need a long long time in more moderate pain to compensate for a brief moment in intense pain the problem with this also is that the participants relied on memory and memory is also subject to a number of uh biases so for example one of the uh uh main biases that we see with a memory of past events and past unpleasant events is known as the pig and heris or Pig and Rule and here you have pain intensity,23
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,24:41,and duration so you have these two experiences and they are absolutely the same there was a peak of pain and here the experience ended here and in the future judgments participants said well it was hor horrible in this case you also experien the same amount of pain and the same temporal evolution of pain but in a future judgment participants said well it was not that bad it was okay and what happened here here what happened is that the end of the experience was milder and people tend to remember the end of the experience so if the end was not that bad this is going to be judged as better when you remember it than this even though overall you suffered more pain here than here so this is a problem for remembering how unpleasant uh different events were this is also a problem for uh animal,24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,25:45,experience experiments if this can be translated to animals uh in case of condition Place preference and condition Place aversion uh experiments we don't know if this rule um works for animals but just as a a note if it does it would be wonderful because by making an experience that is bad more pleasant in the end you can uh the longer term effects of the pain painful experience in terms of you know sensitization anxiety fear Etc can be uh somehow uh mitigated but with don't know if this is the case for Animals uh too okay so because we have this problem with memories we also analyzed some uh studies we looked for studies looking at firsthand experiences so uh woman in labor or uh experience with post uh surgical pain or with cancer pain for whom the uh questions were made why they,25
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,26:52,were in pain and surprisingly we only found two studies in which this was St while the human subjects were experiencing the pain so it's extremely scarce in the the the the this type of research extremely scarce in the human literature as well and again uh we find the same pattern uh severe pain is judged as much much worse disproportionately worse than uh more moderate pain but the way in which this happens depends on the nature of the pain so here it's 1 to 500 more or less in the case of Po post surgical pain and here uh the ratio is one to 100 more or less in the case of severe cancer pain okay uh so disproportionately um more weight to more severe pain this is the same we find in psychophysics so for example uh with humans uh psychophysics is the field,26

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,44:44,the pain estimates are based on the behavior of animals in the lab I'm thinking about for example how a piglet react reacts to castration in the lab versus being one of thousands of animals being castrated in a hurry because of by poorly trained workers in a farm um so the way the estimates are are uh done is by using every single possible evidence that we can so both in the lab and in the farm setting and even theoretical uh knowledge on things like evolutionary reasoning for why the pain associated with castration in your example should be intense from an evolutionary perspective it makes sense that the pain associated with future reproduction is intense but also you have a number of markers uh of pain like pain specific behaviors following castration without anesthesia um uh hormone levels um facial expressions Etc done in the lab and in farm settings and once we have,42
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,45:54,this evidence uh what we are doing now and this is an upgrade of what we did before is to rate the evidence on the extent to which it's compatible with the different different definitions of pain intensity so for each piece of evidence is it compatible with annoying pain hurtful disabling excruciating and then we once we have all this ratings for every single piece of evidence we we integrate the ratings into probabilities and we use the European Food Safety Authority categories of uh probability so extremely likely very likely likely as about as likely as not and so on uh to give a final probability to pain being of one or another intensity I don't know Rachel if that answers your questions uh and that that's not the reason why the numbers are conservative the reasons is uh um we prefer to air on,43
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,46:57,the side of caution because we were calculating the impact of the campaigns cagefree campaigns and better chicken commitment campaigns and uh we didn't want to leave room for the industry to say we were exaggerating and in that sense we didn't consider the full range of implications of a cagefree uh campaign uh you know all the secondary effects that I mentioned uh because not not all of them are completely well established so so that's not the reason yeah thank you oh Lucas do have a couple of examples on how comparison could look like in fishes or invertebrates I think uh it would be the same uh situation so for example in fish we are studying right now the pain associated with um SL slaugher with asphixiation so it depends on the species some species will take two hours uh struggling and while still,44
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,48:06,conscious uh to die and this will be a lot of time in very intense pain which may subside as times goes by it's not certain um and then you would compare the situation with a situation for a fish a farm fish for example in which there's crowding stress over the two years of life of the fish uh when the fish is in a pond so the crowding stress is more moderate suffering as compared to the suffering of being taken out of water it's certainly but you have 20 minutes out of water or two hours out of water compared to two years of uh stress at the pond based uh on on what we discussed I would say well it's it's possible that it's worth investing in mitigating suffering in the farm at the farm level because this stress endure uh in the pond over the two years leads to a number of,45
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,49:13,consequences like immune suppression infectious diseases infectious diseases can be extremely painful as painful as asfixiation of course not all fish will endure uh sepsis for example but uh still uh there will be many many things that will happen because of crowding stress because of immune suppression that overall may represent a much larger suffering than the two hours uh as fixating in the end of the life so it depends we would need to have the number for the fish or for the shrimp but uh right now my my best guess would be well I would go for the intervention at the farm level to ensure that the animal can have a net positive life can enjoy positive effective experiences because depending on the level of stress even though it may not be excruciating it may almost completely prevent enjoying positive effective,46
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,50:21,experiences does it make sense uh Lucas okay so it's it's not definitive answer we don't have a definite like a fixed answer for everything I I think it needs to be analyzed on a Case by case basis and I think it's more or less the same conclusion that um will and Adam arrived in their report uh of the um Workshop in which we discussed the relative importance of duration and intensity will let me know if if you don't agree with that no I basically agree um but it's since you invited me to talk I'll maybe ask a question that I had um which I was just curious if um if in any of your work you found interventions where there is like a tradeoff uh where you might be like increasing um one type of pain at the,47
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,51:26,expense of reducing another like I think the only one I could think of off like the top of my head is that you know there's like discussion about um how quickly controlled atmosphere stunning should be done and like that might trade off how SE uh how severe it is versus how long it takes but um yeah I'm just curious if in your work on broilers or hens or pigs or or fishes you found any other interventions that are like that no no so far uh uh with the um production systems we looked at the uh direction of the intervention was clear so definitely cage free cage free settings are better than cage settings or use use of slower growing Broiler breeds is better than fast growing even though they live longer so they would have more time suffering because their life is like two weeks longer um but still uh it's better to use slower growing breeds because when you have better genetics the harms that they experience,48
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,52:39,have their onset later in life so they end up in the end experience experiencing shorter times in pain uh and with the uh stunning like the CO2 uh stunning we have haven't analyzed different types of uh stunning like multiple phases as compared to Shorter number of lower number of phases uh but I I would imagine it's it's difficult to say in that case I think we will need to run the calculations and and see what the ratio is of time in more moderate pain in the case of like more phases as comp comped to more briefer but more intense pain when you have just one or two phases uh and see what this ratio is is like like one to 100 one to a th000 and and make a decision based on that now that said,49
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,53:41,there are other considerations that should be taken into account so things like well it's likely that people in the slaugh plants may go for a faster stunning anyway because they want to speed up the process because this is like much more uh cost effective for them uh from from the point of view of saving money uh and um so this this sort of thing should be considered too when the answer is not is not clear but so far we prefer to keep the uh our solution is to keep the four levels of intensity these are segregated because this will vary so much with the species with the system with the situation that we don't think it's feasible right now to to come up with this uh equivalence levels and integrate the the the the the,50
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,54:40,estimates it makes um cost Effectiveness calculations harder but as I said in most situations we can have a clear ranking of the of the options that organizations have yes uh Blake hey Cynthia thank you for giving this talk uh always learn a lot whenever whenever I listen to you um so my question is about you you talked about the dynamic of of how some of these uh pain intensities can can change so 1 second of excruciating pain versus 30 seconds it might not be linear um how that relates and you you talked about that in relation to other types of pain um now my question is about how is that within a type of pain so I could have two interventions one where every or you know two two situations one where every animal experiences one second of,51
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,55:48,excruciating pain and another one where one in 30 experiences 30 seconds of excruciating pain and when I aggregate across the population they both come out as 1 second of excruciating pain on average um now if we compared that to disabling pain what you were suggesting was that those would actually be quite different um when you're not comparing it to disabling pain and now you're just trying to compare within excruciating pain there's another level of complexity there um and I was wondering if you'd kind of thought about this a little bit yeah yeah I I I completely see your point so if if you endure one second of excruciating pain it could be excruciating pain but 30 seconds of excruciating pain could be something qualitatively different uh which is like an excruciating version of excruciating pain so it would be a different level of intensity because you have to endure it for so much longer that it it leads to to a different uh,52
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,56:53,experience uh so in that that case we would need to have additional levels of pain intensity uh the reason we don't have that of course this could be created and some people using our method they have subdivided our four intensity categories into more intensity categories so disabling low disabling High excruciating low excruciating high and so on you could do that and in a sense uh this would be one way to address uh this problem the problem always uh comes back to lack of evidence with with excruciating pain which we use very cautiously it's the level of pain that already causes you know extreme levels of disruption in biological systems and we don't think that excruciating pain could be withstand for a long time it would be the type of pain that caus causes you to,53
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgRnnUohLI,Short agony or long ache: comparing sources animal suffering that differ in duration and intensity,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Feb 2024,57:55,shut down your system because it's just so much you cannot take it so uh so I don't see even though theoretically it's possible I don't necessarily see that we would have a case okay you need to endure 30 seconds or 10 minutes of excruciating pain like this I I don't see that this that this would necessarily happen it would be the case of people you just just committing suicide jumping out of the building because they're burning alive a they they cannot stand it any longer or just you know losing Consciousness because they the system shuts down there is neurological shock does it answer your question Blake um yeah I I think that that kind of would we'd end up in a situation where uh like you know it's it's nonlinear but also it may be like the derivative may not always be positive or may not always be negative or something like that um and so you end up with it's,54

My father bought me a gun that I could shoot the wildlife in the local area to bits with when I was six. For a time, I did this. I was quite successful. I was not a bad marksman.

And after a little bit, it dawned on me that this was a rather stupid activity. Why do you shoot them first and then try and bring them back to life? And so I got a bantam chicken.

I had a male, a rooster, and I had a female. And this was good. I was about nine at the time. I thought this was tremendous.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,4:19,E com isso se possibilitou né também para atender essa demanda dessa imensa população um aumento enorme da quantidade de animais produzidos a gente saiu aí de cerca de menos de 10 bilhões de animais terrestres abatidos por ano em 1950 60 para mais de 70 bilhões de animais abatidos todos os anos animais terrestres isso não inclui peixes né A maioria deles sendo galinhas para consumo de frango e naturalmente uma consequência natural desse processo foi o aumento do consumo per capita por pessoa de carne todos os anos então a gente tem aqui um gráfico por exemplo que mostra o consumo em diversos países no Brasil a gente tem um consumo de mais de 109 kg de Carnes por pessoa por ano né em alguns países chega mais de 150 quilos de carne por pessoa por ano né chegaria quase aí 400 gramas 500 gramas por dia todos os dias em,5

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,6:33,dela principalmente se ela for transmissível de pessoa a pessoa não necessariamente ela vai ficar restrita aquele local onde ela surgiu aqui por exemplo é o mapa global das rodas de transporte aéreo então se torna muito fácil ver que uma doença transmissível de pessoa para pessoa por exemplo por vias aéreas poderia se espalhar muito rapidamente pelo mundo todo né questão de dias como a gente viu por exemplo no caso da gripe suína de 2009 Gripe A né ou da covid-19 Então nesse contexto não é tão surpreendente assim que muitas das pandemias e epidemias que surgiram no último século nos últimos séculos elas são diretamente ligadas a captura de animais para consumo e a produção de animais para consumo Então a gente tem vários casos aqui mostrados nesse mapa então por exemplo os surdos e ebola na África né relacionados ao consumo de morcegos né o manuseio de morcegos,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,7:35,o surto de Sasuke quase virou uma grande pandemia em 2002 2003 relacionado ao consumo de animais selvagens também a gripe A que eu já mencionei relacionada a produção de porcos os vários surtos de gripe aviária a transmissão do vírus da Aids também relacionado ao consumo de primatas na África e assim por diante e como a transmissão dessas doenças ocorre ou seja como um patógeno que está no Animal venha a infectar a população humana Existem várias rotas né através das quais isso isso pode acontecer então patógenos né vírus bactérias que circulam na fauna Silvestre eles podem atingir a população humana se as pessoas consumirem alimentos contaminados com esses vírus com essa com essas bactérias água contaminada Essa é uma das possibilidades outra possibilidade é a transmissão por vetores ou seja,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,8:39,mosquitos carrapatos etc Esse é o caso da malária né transmitida por um mosquito é o caso do Zika e muitos outros doenças né no caso desses dois fatores aqui vetores e alimentos água contaminados a probabilidade de que a gente venha a ter uma pandemia uma grande epidemia né de uma distribuição geográfica muito Ampla é muito reduzida se comparado a outras formas por quê Porque elas geralmente está limitada a contato ao contato com estes fatores então por exemplo no caso da malária se a pessoa não está na área geográfica onde tem o vetor o mosquito transmissor da malária ela não vai pegar malária porque a malária não passa de pessoa a pessoa né a mesma coisa com doenças originadas em alimentos ou em Água contaminado se ela não passa de pessoa a pessoa a pessoa tem que ter contato com aquele alimento com aquela água então a probabilidade de que isso,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,9:44,se transforme em uma grande pandemia é muito mais baixa agora hoje em dia a gente não pode deixar de mencionar também o perigo que o estudo e criação de patógenos em laboratório representa também infelizmente mesmo nos Laboratórios com níveis de segurança dos mais altos em países como Estados Unidos Europa e né países da Europa e outros acidentes acontecem né então fugas de animais acontecem violações de Protocolos de biossegurança acontece com uma frequência maior do que seria desejada Esse é uma declaração do grupo de trabalho de Cambridge de 2014 alertando para o perigo da criação de patógenos altamente letais em laboratório tentem conta Justamente a alta frequência desses acidentes de biossegurança né Na época se detectou que era uma média de Dois por semana em laboratórios de alta segurança Então,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,10:48,essa é uma possibilidade também que não pode ser desconsiderada foi uma possibilidade aventada aí para não existe consenso ainda mas para a covid-19 também né então ela deve ser levada a sério então voltando aqui ao esquema das principais rotas uma outra ROTA é a captura e consumo de animais silvestres diretamente né a carne de caça carne de animais selvagens Então essa foi Possivelmente a origem dos surtos de ebola na África que ainda ocorrem esporadicamente você tem Possivelmente os primeiros casos associados ao a captura e consumo de morcegos né então não é tanto o consumo da carne se uma vez que ela já está cozida mas o manuseio do animal da carcaça do animal o contato com os fluídos dele com sangue se esses fluidos,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,11:53,entram na mucosa de uma pessoa nariz boca olhos ou se existe algum corte na pele aonde esses fluidos podem penetrar então você pode ter uma infecção e parece que foi isso que aconteceu né então pode ser diretamente no contato com os humanos ou através de animais intermediários animais selvagens e animais criados ali próximos a florestas e tal como porcos etc através então do contato com esses intermediários a população também pode se infectar infelizmente Os surdos de ebola Até agora foram contidos mas existe transmissão de pessoa a pessoa né Então realmente representa um período bastante grande aqui outros exemplos do Comércio de carne de Castro de animais selvagens e Pode parecer que essas são práticas associadas a lugares remotos mais selvagens populações mais carentes Mas de fato não é o caso né então você tem ainda um grande volume de carne de animais selvagens consumidos só na bacia,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,13:02,do Congo há um tempo atrás você tinha um volume ali de mais ou menos 5 milhões de toneladas de carne de caça comercializadas e não necessariamente As populações que consomem são carentes então em muitos lugares isso a carne de caça é vista como uma algo Gourmet Então não é que necessariamente o desenvolvimento econômico numa região levaria a redução dessa prática e como a gente sabe o consumo da carne de animais selvagens também não é não ocorre só em lugares remotos né então aqui a gente tem a foto de um desses mercados de animais vivos os famosos mercados úmidos que existem na Ásia mas também em outros continentes África e África e até as Américas e o problema né desses lugares é que eles propiciam uma série de condições ideais para transmissão de patógenos que estão na fauna silvestre para a população humana existe um mito de que esses,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,14:07,animais necessariamente foram cassados muitas vezes não é o caso você tem que fazendas de animais selvagens que criam animais até de forma Industrial com as mesmas condições industriais que a gente vai ver e depois comercializam Esses animais nesses mercados então não necessariamente a carne de caça existe bom quais são essas condições né primeiro existe uma alta diversidade de patógenos de animais de várias populações muitas vezes vivos ainda comercializados vivos que estão nesses locais de espécies diversas que podem que se encontram nesses locais nesses epicentros E aí podem ocorrer combinações de material genético de patógenos diversos as condições que os animais estão são condições de stress Agudo extremo né eles são mantidos em gaiolas eles sem alimentação muitas vezes sem água em condições sanitárias muito precárias elas dejetos dos animais uns em cima dos outros o animal é abatido muitas vezes no próprio local você tem aquele sangue então nessas condições,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,15:15,higiênicas precárias primeiro a transmissão é facilitada e segundo o stress como a gente vai ver com mais Detalhe ele é imunossupressor né então em condições de stress é o sistema imunológico fica deficiente estando deficiente qualquer vírus qualquer bactéria que esteja neste animal se multiplica muito rapidamente e é liberado nos fluidos nas fezes etc Então você tem altas cargas virais por exemplo nos dejetos desses animais que estão nesses lugares e aí isso é a receita perfeita para transmissão inclusive para a população humana que tá lá né então são realmente lugares perigosos do ponto de vista com risco né epidemiológico no caso do Comércio de animais silvestres né aí não necessariamente para consumo mas tráfego como Pet como,15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,16:16,para outros fins o risco epidemiológico é semelhante né então você tem animais que são levados para regiões muito distantes levando consigo esses patógenos eles são transportados em condições muitas vezes com frequentemente brutais né Então muitos morrem os que sobrevivem passam por situações de stress Agudo novamente imunossupressor que propicia essa multiplicação de patógenos essa liberação de patógenos no ambiente no caso do tráfico ilegal você não tem inspeções sanitárias então Digamos que é um reservatório de patógenos amplificado que está sendo transmitido para diversas regiões né então apresentam risco de que novos novos patógenos que possam causar epidemias pandemias surgem nessas condições Mas o que eu vou me concentrar aqui é o,16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,17:21,que é reconhecido cada vez mais como principal risco para o surgimento de novas pandemias e epidemias que é a produção moderna de animais de produção a produção intensiva de animais como porcos e galinhas que propicia transmissão amplificação e recombinação de patógenos nesses animais de produção então eu acredito que vai ficar claro nessa conversa que primeiro a forma como os animais de produção São criados e comercializados hoje em dia representa uma grande ameaça para saúde e bem-estar do ser humano e muitas das condições que ameaçam a saúde e o bem-estar destes animais são também as condições que ameaçam a nossa saúde pública Mas vamos lá porque então a pecuária intensiva né moderna é o que que tem aí noventa e nove porcento das criações propicia o surgimento de doenças infecciosas com,17

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,19:42,4% do peso de mamíferos no planeta então isso obviamente se traduz na existência de um reservatório imenso de patógenos é esses animais de produção facas frangos galinhas porcos etc abrigam uma quantidade muito grande de patógenos de vírus de bactéria simplesmente por uma questão de escala de estatística eles estão em mais número e mais volume agora até Possivelmente mais importante do que a questão de escala e número é o fato de que o sistema de produção industriais intensivos modernos de hoje em dia eles propiciam as condições ideais tanto para o surgimento como para transmissão de doenças infecciosas que envolvem esse confinamento em áreas fechadas de grandes grupos de animais Então essas granjas de galinha de frango de corte podem ter aí 50 100 até 200 mil animais,19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,20:50,confinados juntos se um patógeno surge aí um vírus Ele se espalha muito rapidamente afeta todos os animais aqui uma foto numa granja de engorda de porcos também mantidos em altas densidades em contato direto E além disso a gente tem um Outro fator que é muito importante que a seleção genética intensa para o crescimento rápido e para alta produtividade então por exemplo a gente tem a foto de um frango criado para carne dele frango de corte em 1957 aos 56 dias de idade com a mesma idade em 78 e com a mesma idade em 2005 nesse período que é um período relativamente curto a genética do animal foi modificada de tal forma que com 56 dias antes ele tinha menos de 1 kg e hoje em dia ele tem mais de 4 kg esse trabalho de 2014 fazem 10 anos praticamente isso já até piorou O problema é que é quando a gente tem,20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,21:59,uma seleção genética focada quase que exclusivamente na produtividade no crescimento rápido no ganho de peso o que acontece dentro de um sistema biológico é que outros órgãos outras funções críticas que não ganho de massa muscular o ganho de gordura o ganho de peso eles acabam ficando prejudicados comprometidos e estas outras funções incluem a função imunológica então a energia que seria usada para o sistema imunológico ela é desviada para o crescimento rápido e para produção então o sistema imunológico fica prejudicado Além disso outros taxa de crescimento da musculatura Então você tem pulmões que tem uma série de deficiências Você tem o sistema cardíaco também com uma série de deficiências é um sistema é um sistema cardiorrespiratório extremamente fácil você tem juntas enfim problema de,21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,23:00,claudicação de movimentação muito frequente né um animal que realmente não seria viável se ele fosse deixado solto na natureza ou se ele sobrevivesse por mais tempo do que os 40 42 dias que ele vive essa seleção focada quase que exclusivamente na produtividade também levou a uma homogeneidade genética muito grande então se você tem animais muitos semelhantes do ponto de vista genético a imunologia deles é muito semelhante se surge um patógeno um vírus por exemplo que pode infectar um animal né que afeta um animal muito provavelmente ele vai afetar todos os outros animais né porque eles são muito parecidos Então você não vai ter aquela diversidade algum indivíduo que porventura seja resistente e consiga resistir aquela infecção quanto maior A homogeneidade genética maior a probabilidade de grande surtos,22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,24:04,de grandes epidemias também então resumindo um pouco esses pontos que eu comentei na pecuária intensiva a seleção genética para a produtividade e crescimento tem uma série de consequências primeiro se desvia energia para crescimento e reprodução levando a uma imunidade mais eficiente existe uma homogeneidade genética também prejudicando o sistema imunológico e além disso a função pulmonar ela é comprometida pelo crescimento rápido né levando a uma imunidade deficiente e propiciando condições para a evolução de mais virulência para maior transmissão de patógenos que porventura surjam nesses sistemas muito importante também é o fato de que essa exposição crônica ao estresse nestes ambientes confinados ela leva a imunossupressão novamente a ela,23

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,33:40,do vírus da gripe aviária eles têm uma taxa de letalidade muito alta em alguns casos acima de 50% Então até então não existe a transmissão de pessoa para pessoa né a pessoa precisa ter contato entrada em contato com com uma ave infectada mas se houver uma mutação alguma recombinação que permita ao vírus se transmitir de pessoa para pessoa isso seria um problema enorme vocês imaginam que no caso do covid dependendo do grupo de risco a gente teve uma mortalidade enfim quando era alta era um por cento né agora imagina uma mortalidade de 50% né Isso realmente poderia representar um colapso da civilização né enfim afetaria todos os serviços básicos 50% de mortalidade não é algo que a população mundial conseguiria se recuperar em nenhum espaço de tempo curto Então essas são algumas das linhagens de vírus altamente patogênicos da gripe,32

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,51:24,doenças como tuberculose AIDS malária doença sexualmente transmissíveis doenças da infância pneumonia desinteria outras doenças respiratórias já não podem ser tratadas com antibióticos que tradicionalmente eram usados para tratar essas doenças né as bactérias que causam elas passaram a se resistentes a esses antibióticos isso está acontecendo em todo mundo né e representa uma ameaça porque você tem a infecções que eram tratadas muito facilmente que hoje em dia podem voltar a matar se você não encontrar algum antibiótico que faz efeito Então aquela grande redução da taxa de mortalidade que a gente mencionou no começo ela pode ter um retorno né ela pode aumentar a mortalidade por doenças infecciosas se a gente perder esse esse milagre aí que são os antibióticos se Tudo continuar Como está a previsão é,48
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,52:29,que em 2050 a gente tem a cerca de 10 milhões de mortes por ano diretamente relacionadas a falta de antibióticos para tratar determinadas doenças doenças isso é mais que câncer é mais que diabetes é mais do que acidentes de trânsito e assim por diante mas como é que uma bactéria se torna resistente ao antibiótico então aqui nesse gráfico a gente tem uma população de bactérias que está se dividindo se multiplicando em um determinado momento Essa bactéria uma delas adquire uma mutação por exemplo que a torna resistente a um determinado antibiótico quando esse antibiótico entra em contato com a população aqui nesse verdinho difuso ele vai matar todas as bactérias que não são resistentes a ele mas a bactéria que adquiriu a capacidade de resistência vai sobreviver e essa bactéria então que vai se multiplicar,49
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,53:30,Então essa resistência ela surgiu e ela passou adiante para as populações quanto maior o nível de Exposição antibióticos mais rápida é evolução dessas resistência a gente tá colocando ali um fator que está favorecendo aquelas bactérias que seriam naturalmente resistentes e são elas que vão passar para frente e se multiplicar Então esse é o processo natural né agora o problema é que a gente acelerou muito esse processo e como é que a gente acelerou esse processo bom primeiro com o sobreuso né os exagerado de antibióticos na medicina humana Então uso frequente para condições que nem são tratadas muitas vezes com antibióticos onde não haveria a necessidade então selecionando cada vez mais bactérias resistentes a eles e os incorreto também,50
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9X8boT-fuU,Os riscos da pecuaria intensiva para a saude global,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,54:32,né mas o que pouco a gente sabe é que é maioria dos antibióticos vendidos no mundo e que foram vendidos nas últimas décadas no mundo eles não são usados na população humana eles são usados para animais em Sistemas de criação intensiva 73% de todos os antibióticos vendidos no mundo né três quartos são usados em porcos galinhas e até peixes criados em Sistemas de criação intensiva então para quê com dois propósitos o primeiro original era como promotores de crescimento animais quando tomam antibióticos em doses subterapêuticas por um processo por exemplo de seleção de uma determinada flora bacteriana que é mais eficiente em digerir do ponto de vista energético eles tendem a crescer um pouco mais 5 10 15% mais né então a indústria adotou isso como uma prática o outro uso que é o uso,51

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,1:08,you NASA and hello everybody um it's great to be here this afternoon and to see so many here uh but if we're gonna have enough time for Q&A then I'll have to jump right into the presentation um so the idea for this webinar came from something I've been wondering about a lot recently obviously changing Minds is the animal Freedom movement's ultimate strategy to achieve our goals but we haven't cracked how to do it reliably yet so anyone who knows me so anyone um from ATT on the call will know that I'm really into leftist YouTube content and I noticed that some of these YouTubers that I enjoy get a reputation for changing Minds for converting people in the alt right While others don't and I was interested as to why that might be they all seem to make equally good points from my,2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,2:09,perspective but there seems to be something about the presentation or the relationship they form with their audience that makes the difference as to why some of these influences change minds and others don't and I thought we could learn a lot from um knowing how Minds change in the animal Freedom Movement considering that we also have to change Minds with mass messaging so I critically analyze the best research we've come across and that we've seen echoed in other areas of our research and the result of that is what I'm going to share with you today and by the end of today you'll be coming away with some key Concepts uh that will help you persuade people towards animal freedom in your messaging so if we're going to understand how to change Minds we need to understand how minds work in the first place and to,3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,3:08,begin I'm going to start with uh Tech will cooperate doesn't seem to want to there we go with what seem might it might seem quite an odd statement this reasoning isn't logic and that's because we thought form our thoughts and beliefs and then confirmation bias does the rest we reason to serve our existing beliefs it's not a logical process and yes you too we all do this we tend to think we understand where our beliefs come from um because we use this retrospective reasoning to justify them it's possible to become aware of the process but most of us don't and we go through life thinking that we've come to our thoughts and beliefs rationally by examining all the data and then coming to the most rational or reasonable,4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,4:09,conclusion when in reality we almost certainly haven't it can make it quite hard to understand other people especially when they differ with us on something really important because you think well they've seen all the evidence I have so how can how can they think like that and this is because our thoughts and beliefs come from a subjective reality that each of us have our brains use their experiences to build unique chain assciation that we're mostly on aware of and these chains help us process the world they inform all of our decisions and our judgments so it's only by developing an understanding of this that we can begin to understand why others think like they do for example if you were to say to an average person animals should have political representation they're probably going to think that you're Bonkers unfortunately and that's because their,5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,5:13,network of cognitive chains aren't built to comprehend it first they'll think this means other animals as politicians giving speeches um and there are mental model around politics will be linked to their cognitive chain around in Ence and their model of intelligence and all the cognitive chains coming off that are probably built on an anthropocentric worldview and all the associated chains with that so they simply can't pass the idea because their chain of reasoning just isn't set up to do so it's a bit like when somebody's born deaf and they get colear implants in later life it can take a while for the brain to perceive this new input as sound and that's simply because the brain hasn't developed these cognitive Pathways so if we understand this about people if we have what we call cognitive empathy for them then we can start to,6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,6:13,work out how to change these cognitive chains and remake reality so the key to persuasion is to somehow disrupt these change of chains of reasoning it's to get people to change and rebuild the the the processing that they have so that they can come to a different decision and change their behavior how we'd want them to the main way that we're persuaded in everyday life and the main way that Pro animal organizations try to persuade the public comes from advertising so we'll have a quick brief look now about the psychology behind how they try and influence our decision making so social psychology works on the basis that we have two main ways of processing messages uh sometimes they're called first and second order thinking or they're called um fast and slow thinking but today we'll stick with spontaneous,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,7:19,processing and thoughtful processing so we tend to use spontaneous processing when something isn't relevant to us on a deep level or particularly high stakes um when we're spontaneously processing we take in information quickly we take it in passively uh we're more likely to make impulsive judgments based on spontaneous processing So based on like the vague feeling or the The Vibes that a message gives us and ads that solely Target spontaneous processing probably won't give you any information about the product or service they're trying to persuade you to buy they'll just try and invoke a feeling about a product so um anybody else in the UK on the call um you probably remember this there was an advert for CAD bre's chocolate in the UK back in 2007 and it had a guy in a gorilla suit drumming along to Phil Collins In the Air Tonight and it was really effective at targeting spontaneous processing it,8

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,10:33,life so where I think that we can sometimes fall down in animal Freedom messaging is relying too much on spontaneous processing to try and change minds and this is particularly uh evident around shock tactics and horror imagery so there was a study carried out um on horror and shock inducing imagery in smoking cessation ads and it concluded that this counterintuitively often Works to turn people off the rest of the message particularly when they don't feel empowered to to make a difference so for the for the smokers if they felt powerless and in the face of the nicotine addiction then the these horror and shock images of disease lungs Etc didn't didn't make a difference to them it turned them off but aside from this I think it might not be the best way to go because when we rely on spontaneous processing to change people's minds we're,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,11:36,unconsciously acting as if taking um action for other animals or changing your beliefs is a low stakes decision when in reality It Isn't So for people who are already inclined our way and have a receptive cognitive structure shock tactics probably work quite well but for people people who've unconsciously predicated a lot of their cognitive structure on the idea of human dominance you're asking them to do an awful lot of work to onep pick that so really persuasive content needs to activate thoughtful processing but this is where we encounter the problem though because take the example of this person with the network of cognitive chains that aren't set up to process the message and bring them to a pro-animal decision the challenge we have then is to get them to follow their chain of processing and come to a different conclusion from their existing,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,12:37,beliefs and the problem is that's really difficult because we're very resistant to change when we're presented with information that runs counter to our beliefs we'd much rather assimilate it into our existing understanding rather than destabilize our mental model to accommodate it it's easier for the average person I think the average person in the UK to use their existing model to come to the conclusion that a practice like tail docking for example is a necessary evil rather than challenge their entire cognitive structure and except that tail docking and the entire system it ex exists to serve is fundamentally wrong so questioning this human dominance worldview is a very challenging thing to ask people to do because it's it's Mo it's much more than asking people to stop smoking it's about it destabilizes a fundamental understanding of the world and it's asking people to change their opinion about the nature of existence,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,13:42,and their PL their place in the world so to persuade these people who aren't already aligned we need to help them deconstruct and then rebuild this network of cognitive chains and that sounds difficult right and that's because it is reconstructing this is a big reconstructing someone's entire chain of processing is a big ask and people are naturally going to be resistant to it because it's scary part of the reason it's so hard to persuade people on these political issues is because the beliefs and attitudes that we Embrace as po as part of our core selves become part of our psychological selves and our brains protect them as such because they're part of Who We Are and our brains protect us from psychological harmm in the same way that they protect us from physical harm so there was um study with patients sorry not patients participants in MRI,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,14:44,machines and it showed that their brains responded to facts that counted their strongly held political opinions as if they were a physical threat and this effect is linked to our evolutionary program programming and our experience of social groups so human brains evolve to reach consensus right um it was a way that we could Forge communities um it was a way we could separate insiders and Outsiders based on their opinions and how they did things and it was obviously very important to stay within the group because it you in these prehistoric times because it provided us with physical safety and it provided for a lot of our phys and a lot of our needs so this means that while we are revolved to argue to reach consensus and assure and basically ensure the collective good of the group it also means that we place a higher importance,15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,15:44,on being good group members than on being right so we're likely to just go along with what most people believe which is obviously very challenging for us but luckily there is a lot of research into how persuasion works and how to do it effectively which we've seen echoed in our own research and I've come up with three key points for us to take away today so number one is to focus on being part of an ingroup with whoever you're trying to persuade which works on this need we have that we were just talking about the social approval when we reason and one of the specific ways you do that is number two leveraging shared values which is particularly helpful when you're creating persuasive content rather than talking oneon-one and then finally using Messengers wisely within that content because the type of Messengers we use to deliver animal Freedom messaging can,16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,16:47,have surprising effects on how receptive people can be to changing their minds so now let's have a look at this first key point being part of an ingroup and the first part of uh this point gets me thinking about when I was a little girl I remember when I was little one of my biggest justifications when I asked for a new toy or game was oh everyone at school has one and then my mom would always say something like this well if everyone else were at school was jumping off a cliff would you do that as well and it turned turn out that when I was a kid I was just vocalizing a very common form of reasoning that persists into adulthood and this is this idea of social proof we often behave based on what we think other people are doing there's been experiments that show people will take positive action if they believe that others like them are and this,17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,17:52,effect is still seen when the peer group is really loose and and arbitrary so some of you might have heard of the hotel towel experiment it's been performed a few times but I'll explain it simply now essentially um experimenters went into hotel rooms and they put up one of two signs in each the first sign was just there to provide a Baseline and it had a standard message that just asked Hotel guests to reuse towels to conserve energy but the second one worked on this idea of social proof by saying that most of guests in the hotel reuse their towels and this resulted in a 26% increase in guests reusing towels compared to the Baseline message so it shows how we could be influenced into a behavior if we believe that the majority of others are doing it now just Side by a side let's go back to the slide we were,18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,18:53,on okay and what's particularly interesting about social proof is that this effect doesn't just happen with positive action people will also take negative action if they believe others are there was a sort of reverse experiment to the um social Pro to the hotel towel experiment about people stealing petrified wood from national parks and the researchers found that the more people that more people stole if they left signs up tell people how terrible it was that lots of other people were stealing petrified wood so it shows how strong this idea of majority of this idea of majority of behavior is when we're making decisions about what's morally acceptable so what can we take away from this well firstly I would absolutely jump off a cliff if everyone else at school was doing it and my mom owed me a PS3 but more importantly to persu W others we should be focusing on the,19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,20:00,growing numbers of people changing their mind and taking action so that we can leverage this bandwagon effect building on this being likable is really important to persuasion because people are more open to being persuaded by people they like it puts you at ease it makes you more receptive and it takes some of the scariness out of questioning our own reasoning and we're particularly open to being persuaded by people who we think of as Like Us in some way who share a group identity with us and what's interesting is that you can be like someone in a fairly arbitrary way and still be persuaded by what they do so I actually lied for there was a third sign in the hotel towel experiment that said that most guests who you used this room reused their towels and just pointing out this small similarity between the reader and other,20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,21:06,people increased towel reuse by 33% compared to the Baseline so a 7% increase on the on the sign that didn't specify the room and it show so this shows that the a vector of similarity no matter how small can have this boosting effect okay now back to the slide we on okay and this is why it's so important that when we break that when we um we're communicating for animal Freedom we need to break down barriers rather than build them between us and people we want to reach we don't want to create an Us and Them atmosphere um and we need to break down this popular image of a holier than thou vegan because it can be really alienating to potential allies because what we share is more important than how we differ not only because them being able to identify with animals and with Animal Advocates is key but because if we find and leverage the right the right,21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,22:13,identity um that will make people feel that people like them are Animal Advocates and also people like them are other animals we should be able to mobilize more people this is something that we're working on in our research and we've not found the right one yet but we are working on it it's ongoing and we suspect that there will be different identity leverages for different groups so what so watch this space essentially okay lastly when we're leveraging these ingroup identities to persuade people it's important to work with them not against them so people people aren't usually convinced by arguments when they're being challenged on something deeply held because changing your mind scary and the problem is argue arguments have winners and losers and nobody wants to be a loser so the mental defenses come right up in an argument situation the key is to make people feel,22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,23:20,safe enough to think about their thinking particularly in onetoone conversations successful persuad pursue the truth as a shared goal with their conversation partner rather than as something to beat them over the head with and the key to that is to build rapport so that they feel safe enough to explore so there's a very successful technique for onetoone conversation called Deep canvasing uh that that works on Rapport building mainly and it's proven to being lastingly persuasive okay so deep canvassing is a door knocking technique developed by the learn act build arm of the Los Angeles lgbtq Center and canvases develop and practice conversational techniques to shift opinion on lgbtq issues it works because it's focused on creating a safe space to change your mind they never directly contradict the,23
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,24:27,persuade they focus on their motivations instead they get them thinking about their own thinking and their past and their experiences and the way they feel about things and they get around defensiveness related to talking about these issues by being empathetic and then creating an empathetic link uh between lgbtq folk and the persuade they also use active listening to make sure that the persuade feels heard and feels respective and they lower this defensiveness still more by using something called vulnerability modeling and this means being really open about their own formative experiences or if they've ever changed their mind on these issues themselves and it works to build a connection and to put the persuad at ease and one study showed that a skilled deep canvas could change one in 10 Minds,24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,25:27,in a little as 20 minutes and unchanging for good as well it seemed to be a a lasting change and I want you to keep this in mind as we go through the rest of the slides because I think that this sort of empathetic one-to-one conversation is probably the Silver Bullet for persuasion but when we combine what we know about deep canvasing but also other principles we can learn a lot about how we we could approach animal Freedom messaging even when we're doing mass communication rather than onetoone communication but for now we'll move on to the second key Point leveraging shared values the then these are the things that really connect us and turn us into an ingroup on a deep level so does anybody remember this Donald Trump quote I'm a very stable genius well it actually Taps into a real cognitive bias humans experience we,25
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,26:29,assume that our opinions are stable and consistent and this is to the point that when people change their minds they often forget they felt any different we've all probably done this and then forgotten about it I'm sure there are some an Animal Advocates out there possibly even some on this call who when they were very young used to argue passionately for their right to eat other animals and then have forgotten about this after they've made the the change but often they'll have argued that way because of something else that they value like individuality or self-determination and then later on it's that same value that leads them to animal advocacy just reframed and with a different understanding of the world and that's usually the case when people change their mind it's often they've changed their mind based on a core value that has remained consistent so they view their behavior and beliefs as consistent too even though they aren't,26
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,27:33,necessarily and studies show us that not only do we view ourselves as feeling and acting consistently we want to be viewed that way too we want other people to see us that way basically to persuade we need to work with human psychology and this is why something called the labeling technique can be a really persuasive tool for leveraging Shar values because people want to be consistent and viewed that way people will live up to the label you give them so this means that when you assign a belief an attitude a trait or any sort of label to a person and then make a request calling on that label people will respond so there was another study in which participants who were labeled as good politically engaged citizens by the experimenters went to be 15% more likely to vote so it shows that people really act on labels probably for better or,27
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,28:35,worse so for animal Freedom there are two related things to take away from this if we want to connect with people on shared values then we need to examine how we use labels uh particularly ones like carnest or Meer because people will live up to the labels that we give them and we also need need to find new labels aspirational labels rooted in shared values and in Emotion um to change people's minds and this is what's guiding a lot of our research at ATT um this is um ongoing research and it's focusing on which labels and identities people aspire to so that we're not only labeling them and asking them to live up to it it's it's labeling them with something they want to be labeled as to so we have to facilitate people in believing they're behaving consistently to work with human,28
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,29:37,psychology we have to draw the link between labels values and action to change Minds on a broad scale and build a movement when people take action for Animals well for other animals they have to believe they're acting consistently based on who they already think they are so if we lower the the conceptual barrier to entry we allow people to see themselves as consistent with their own values when they act in ways that support other animals and the good thing about doing this is that it acts as the Thin end of the wedge once you've got somebody to make a small commitment based on the idea of consistency with their values they're more likely to make larger commitments in the future to be seen as consistent with the smaller Comm commitment they made before so it's really a way of sort of getting in and getting people further further embedded okay and now we're going to,29
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,30:38,move on to the last key point which I think draws everything we've heard together and can help me give some actual examples of the sort of content that works to persuade people um and give you some ideas for how you can create persuasive content for for our movement and this is about using Messengers wisely ly first we'll talk about expert Messengers and that's when you try and persuade somebody by saying um I'm a dentist and trust me this Colgate toothpaste will save your teeth and this is persuasive up until a point it works because we tend to trust Messengers when we're processing spontaneously um it works well for toothpaste and it works well for chocolate if you had a chocolate expert um because for most people choosing those things is no big deal but where expert messagers can fall down as a persuasive technique is when the message is of high personal relevance and so trigger this slow and,30

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,32:52,well we know that onetoone connection is really important because it makes people feel safe and accepted and we also know that skillful one-to-one persuasion seems to be very reliable in changing Minds for good even on these issues of really high personal relevance the success of deep canvasing is emblematic of that the human connection that deep canvases make with those they talk to allows them to be receptive and makes them feel safe enough to gently examin their own chain of reasoning so our challenge is this one onetoone conversation is probably the best Persuader on on these these sorts of issues but advocates for other animals can't change Minds one by one so we need to find a way to synthesize the power of onetoone,32
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,33:52,persuasion into one to many messaging and I think the way to do this is with expert mind changes and the best example I've seen of campaign messaging that does this is freedom to marry uh if you're a regular at these webinars you'll have heard us mentioned freedom to marry many many times because we're really inspired by them but for the uninitiated it was the campaign dedicated to winning marriage equality in the US which they amazingly managed in the space of eight years uh they're a great resource for ads and I think this one here is a really good example of them combining what works in oneto one persuasion with shared values by using a different kind of expert messenger in George here the proud Florida father I won't actually play the video because it can be a bit of a tech nightmare but um essentially George talks about his marriage to his wife Morin whose mixed race and how he reacted to his daughter n coming out as,33

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,36:00,really persuasive voice because he's been there and he shares values that he has in common with the with the audience like self-determination and the importance of family so it puts this hypothetical um conservative viewer at ease he's not an expert but he is an expert when it comes to changing his mind and he provides an example of how the viewers cognitive Network the cognitive chains could be rebuilt and reordered because George's acceptance of his daughter is built on these individual list of family values that he shares with the audience and it works to minimize and shame ego threat because George is vulnerability modeling he's providing a model of someone admitting they were wrong and it makes it less scary for the fewer to do the same so to sum up what we've talked about today into some key takeaways this is what I'd have you bear in mind um use use one to many messaging to synthesize the persuasive power of,35

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,43:55,idea of Rapport building and um active listening vulnerability modeling um try and find vectors of similarity rather than difference and leverage those I guess but also look up deep canvasing because they'll explain it better than I do thank you um a question from Daria hopefully I'm pronouncing it right uh are there any know animal Liberation activists already following this type of communication um so hang on let me think about that one um that's what we're trying to get more people on board with in narrative ATT uh it's really important to us that um animal freedom and animal ADV animal Freedom um activists and Advocates start to uh use this sort of um coms uh animal Rising are doing some great coms at the moment um we yeah we're an admirer of,42

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,48:18,It's hard to give you exact um suggestions but I would go in and build a relationship with that person if you can not purely based in the um in the in the cause maybe try and get to know them a little bit better um maybe open up yourself um about something that some reason that this is important to you so so like the try and think about why is this important to you and where does that come from on a values level so maybe it's the feeling of in of just of Justice not being done or Injustice and it's it's this is a this is a very like refined skill so it's it's might be quite a hard thing to do but if you go in and try to connect with them on that value of justice and listen more importantly like listen to them and,46
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,49:29,times that they felt Justice hasn't been done or felt good when Justice was done and then try and make this link between the shared value so Justice in this case and the way that that value is being violated in animal testing I hope I hope that helps and I know this is a very it was very out there but hopefully hope that's given you something to work with well it was a very specific question so um and a very broad one at the same time but thank you for your answer so um there's another question from Jessica some non-vegans have said to me that they feel like they are being shamed just by spending time with a vegan and they can act defensive and if even if you don't mention it at all is there a reason uh for this and a way to make them feel more comfortable and therefore more perable I think one of the problems that we have is that this is it's an ego threat sort of by nature to a lot of,47
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,50:35,people and I think it's because deep down people people want to see themselves as moral people and being confronted with a vegan is evidence of a moral a moral good that they are not partaking in so a way that they could be better and I think that this is deeply threatening and I I think that the only way to combat that is to connect with them on a human level is just to like even if you're not you know you laugh with them have a sense of humor um make yourself approachable you know um it's it's not easy it's um I have this experience in my own family um even now but it's um yeah I think honestly the the best way is just to keep slugging on with trying to develop sort of relationships and showing them that,48

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjNBKiaLXo,Persuading the Unpersuadable: Changing Minds for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,8 Feb 2024,52:56,uh let me find a question again any suggestions for how to perciate mainstream established animal rights organizations to alter their messaging tactics sorry is I I didn't understand the word perate does it mean like yeah like convin mainstream established any yeah um so the way that we're trying to do that at at is by showing that they work and um the way we're doing that is with um research reports is with uh developing messaging guides based in the results of This research so um you know maybe send them some some messaging guides guides from from o or Pax forner that show that these these things working in action um but institutions in general can be quite slow to change and adapt so um but the Grassroots is really good at influencing,50

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,2:17,also become sort of a theme in some large scale rcts that we've been conducting as a follow on to a lot of the qualitative research um which is basically around emotion so uh well I'll I'll frame it up in a second but just give a little more background um Pax is as best said it's we're an organization in the US trying to uh use research to rethink the grant strategy specifically for the Grassroots side of the animal Freedom Movement so a lot of our Focus has been on thinking about messaging and how can we you know communicate with the public in a way that that they actually understand um we've also been looking at new strategies uh that especially actually a lot of that came out of the messaging research is sort of new ways of thinking about where do we need to meet the public not just what are we saying but um where do we need to meet them for them to hear the message that we're trying to give and then also thinking about just internal organizing systems,3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,3:16,for for activists something most of us uh our founding group at least came out of direct action everywhere so we we have a sort of our DNA is in the Grassroots side of things and so that's a little bit about who we are um let me just jump right into so as I mentioned we over about two-year period um conducted a major study involving tons of interviews about 200 hours worth of interviews in focus groups with about 200 just normal mediating members of the American public and all of that was kind of inspired by this interesting tension we were noticing in some survey data that was coming out in the last decade um which seemed to suggest that on the one hand a large number of people support something like animal freedom in in principle at least you know like 32% of people saying in a Galla pole the animals should have the same rights as humans to be protected from harm and exploitation or in different um surveys,4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,4:17,near majorities saying they would support a slaughterous ban or as many as 33% saying they would support a total ban on animal farming um which is obviously more people than you know we might think as as animal uh and so there is the other side of that in those same samples um you get people saying 97% of people agreeing with the statement whether to be vegetarian or not is a personal choice and no one can tell me what to do and you know to back that up with kind of real world observational data there seems to have been no apparent real increase in vegetarianism in the United States over the last kind of two decades so as again like I said as animal activists this is like seems like a real contradiction um and we set up to kind of try to square the circle and understand what's going on in people's minds when they give the when the same person who you know is gonna you know something at least 27% of people and you know some of these samples are saying both yeah whether to be vegetarian is a personal choice no tell me what to do but also like Society,5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,5:23,we should uh we should stop animal firing completely um so we wanted to bring people into a an interview setting and just try to draw them out on that and actually understand you know what are they thinking when they say those things um and we were sort of armed with the idea that probably what's going on uh is has to do with framing so framing is there's a whole literature on this idea that it's like uh cognitive patterns and language and it's actually you know so it's it's patterns and language framing has to do with patterns of language but it's also reflected in real cognitive structures in our brain brains and so different language activates like different parts of our brains and causes us to view things through a different lens so that's you know the idea of a frame it's like what what does it put in focus and what does it keep out of focus and so the same person talking through using different language um will focus on different things obvious classic example of a frame is glass half empty versus glass half full um but there are more subtle ways that framing can kind of in influence our decision- making so if frozen yogurt is marketed and it says,6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,6:27,80% fat free you know that sounds maybe like pretty different than 20% fat um or maybe even more mysteriously if a laptop is being sold which is gonna sell more laptops saying it's 20% off or $120 off um I zoom through that because I as I'm gonna say so like I said um we this is all coming from a larger piece of research that uh is available if you want to peruse through a lot of different findings that we had I'm going to summarize some of the the top level before I get into what I specifically want to talk about today but if you do want to poke around this more I encourage you to check out narrative. pm.org little interactive website that we designed to sort of home your way through some of these findings and there is also um some recordings of like webinars and stuff on there that go into different aspects of it so to just go on because today I want to zoom into on something that I haven't talked as much in depth about before um but just to give a quick overview Animal Advocates currently work,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,7:27,spend a lot of our time trying to convince people that farming is harmful so if we think about you know different forms of vegan Outreach our main message in these places is you know trying to show people footage trying to give people information about maybe the environmental harms or about the intelligence of animals and what we found bringing people into a kind of lab setting is that most of the people we talk to are already aware that animal farming is is harmful so they would say things like um you know we would we would bring people in and our our first question which we tried to design to be as neutral as possible before hoping at this point in the conversation they didn't even know that we were Animal Advocates or anything like that we asked this you know starting question so what comes to mind when you think about animals used for food and almost everyone talk to his head something like oh you know I feel so sad it's I don't like to think about it it's horrible what happens da da da so people are there's this awareness is already out,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,8:27,there which is good news a lot of there's of course there's always room for more education and information but a lot of the work that the movement has done over the past few decades has penetrated into the public understanding so people are aware that there's problems with animal farming and that's not you know that's not doing it um some some for some reason that's not enough for them to change their behavior um in the ways that we maybe would like to hope so what we kind of and again I'm zooming over this kind of quickly to try to get to today's topic but um what we saw was sort of patterns and how people engaged with the topic of the suffering of animals used for food um thought of it in sort of layers like layers of sediment that we were kind of boring through in these conversations so started with avoidance PE like so the one of the most common things we heard people say was I try not to think about it I try not to think about what happens because if I do you know then I won't want to eat meat amazing number of people said something exactly like that so there's this avoidance layer that they're kind of going through the world with but in,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,9:31,our conversation um we could they you know if we with a with a gentle invitation that didn't come across as judgmental and was less likely to kind of provoke defensiveness they'd be willing to lean in and and consider the topic um and so the next stage we would encounter is this deep ambivalence so really torn like ambivalence not in the sense of not caring but in the sense of having two really conflicting views on the one hand they're very attached to meet and another animal products but on the other hand they're they're upset about what they know it takes to create those products so they would dwell in this kind of turning ambivalence for a while um but then they'd start to move move to the next layer they'd start to sort of draw out these justifications or rationalizations um to try to resolve that uncomfortable you know sometimes we can call it cognitive distance and it seemed like these justifications were not nothing new like,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,10:29,they were familiar people had thought about them before so these were the things that people had thought through before when they had thought about this topic whe because they encountered video of slaughterhouse or whatever it was that caused them to think about this in the past they' come up with these justifications um and these are things anyone you know I'm sure everyone in this call has encountered um not just you know yeah things like naturalness oh it's it's part of our Evolution to eat animals and our ancestors have always done it or culture you know different cultures have important meat dishes and we shouldn't um you know it's not it's not okay for us to say that that's wrong or to try to take that away from cultures or health you know I need yeah I'm not I just don't think I can get a nutritious diet without eating meat but a lot of these justifications again in this interview setting where the interviewer was kind of trying not to show their own feelings about it but just asking open-ended questions people could kind of talk themselves through some of these justifications so they would you know they if they brought up the naturalness,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,11:36,thing say oh you know it's part of our Evolution and we've always done it they'd hear themselves say that and they'd say well that's yeah that's not a really good that's not Sound Logic you know that's not a good enough reason for me to you know go against something that kind of so obviously goes against my values what's happening to animals and a lot of those justifications were like that they would kind they they were they were kind of insecure people weren't super confident about them or maybe just by themselves they could kind of think through why that maybe wasn't a great reason but one justification or maybe you know stood out and was so consistent and so difficult for people to overcome that we kind of give it its own category and often it would be sort of the end of the conversation which is futility so as people would get to talk through these justifications they would find this idea that you know what though it doesn't matter what I do even if I went vegan there's seven billion other people who aren't um the world's never going to change me has always been here and it always will be here and so I'm not going to be the one,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,12:38,to kind of stick my neck out and take on you know this social cost of being vegan and you know inconvenience myself because it's not going to make a difference anyway and often that would be kind of the end of like the productive part of the conversation at that point it felt like we couldn't you know at first at least in these interviews that would be a real people would be really secure in that futility and just say okay doesn't matter I'm not going to think about it anymore so if we think about these layers you know I think of like in each if we notice these patterns and kind of how people are talking about the thing where we want people to be is that ambivalence right we want people to be processing that these emotions that they have about the topic and we want to invite them to lean into those emotions and all these other you know kind of frames or views that they might be looking through are counterproductive for us or we're trying to get them back to that emotional ambivalence so whatever stage we're in,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,13:41,we're thinking how can I get okay if it's an avoidance what do I need to do to get them to think about it um and maybe the answer is you know non-judgmental invitation then they get to ambivalence but if they move past that and they go into justifications we're hearing those familiar justifications what what can we do about that and I'm going to you know I'll sa that you can definitely encourage you to poke around on the website and stuff um and then futility is a big how to get out of the futility is a big focus of our research and just to very quickly say you know what we think is the most important thing to escape that futility trap is Shifting our engagement with the public from what we call a consumer frame to a Civic frame so um people are used to thinking about food and their food choices as consumers the extent of their thinking about food is their M themselves going to the grocery store going to a restaurant making choices there they don't really picture the system beyond that and that creates a lot of futility that that's very closely attached to this futility like I said before they're thinking of it in terms of well if I just go vegan there's seven billion other people who won't um and so it,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,14:44,doesn't matter what I do so this is a really this Frame presents that problem for us of futility people don't feel like they have the power to make change as individual consumers um the challenge for us as advocates is can we shift our that engagement into a Civic frame where instead of being a conversation about consumer choices like veganism the topic about animal right the topic of animal rights is a conversation about political issues maybe political movements um how they vote rather than how they what they buy at the store uh and this is not just a messaging problem as I kind of alluded to in the very beginning it's also a strategic problem it's not enough to say you know if we say go into a grocery store or restaurant and do a disruption and we say we're asking for you know Civic change we're asking people to change the way they vote people aren't going to really believe us because well why are you disrupting me in a restaurant where I'm not engaged in voting right now I'm engaged in purchasing food um I'm engaged in my role as a consumer so how can we as a movement figure out how to meet the public when they're wearing their civic,15

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,16:48,about how we get people from avoidance into that ambivalence invite them into that emotional conflict that they have and also help them process it constructively maybe in a way where they aren't even going to have to jump over to justification because they can just you know constructively work through this ambivalence right away so that's the hope that's the goal and the challenge uh that arises with that um is the this real Paradox about emotion in animal advocacy messaging so the problem here is on the one hand decide which hand to describe first one of the most common things that we heard in our focus group and kind of interview research as a reaction to animal Advocate messages was that this message is emotionally manipulative so people described you know even showing slaughterhouse footage like if we we think about you know cubes and things like that or even just sharing it,17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,17:55,on social media we weren't showing Slaughter out footage in our interviews and focus groups but yeah different a lot of different messages that we tested one of the main kind of reactions that we heard from our focus group participants was that oh that's like you're that's people trying to emotionally manipulate me people would say I want messages based on facts just give me the facts don't you know try to play with my emotions but then if we actually tried that you know if we actually just gave facts like it's totally boring it's totally false this issue is fundamentally I mean it's very it's a very emotional issue and we need to make an emotional connection with the public for anyone to care about what we're saying if we without a sort of without pointing to the emotional aspect of this topic um we just we're going to get ignored so how do we weave through this challenge I'm gon to make a few recommendations oh here was my thing so people say they prefer fact messages and they don't want to be an emotionally manipulated but in practice without an emotional connection people are just,18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,18:56,going to ignore the topic so I have a few strategies um that came out of our focus groups and then I'm want to explore how this has continued to be really a strong theme in some large scale um randomized control trials that we've done with messaging that this kind of some of these strategies for emotional appeals have just become the strongest Standalone messages that we've identified so and again all of these are things that we can do either in individual Outreach or in uh at a messaging scale so first kind of strategy I'll suggest is leaving a lot of room for the listener um and the main thing about this is sort of really an invitation to use questions rather than statements um but it starts with just toning down our emotional language so yes if knowing going in and knowing that I mean as I think something I could have even mentioned earlier like defensiveness we've all encountered so much defensiveness when we're either doing Outreach or thinking about messaging,19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,19:57,this is one of the main challenges for animal and this this thing about it being emotionally mive is one manifestation of that defensiveness so one thing we just know is that if so many members of the public are kind of perceiving us as hysterical almost or as histrionic those these are like words that came out in our focus groups overly emotional we can tone down the emotional intensity of our language um without like we can trust that just there's to to some extent you know just describing what's happening um has the emotional relevance like it's it's going to like we can trust that just describing what's happening in sort of simpler language without a lot of adverbs is going to get the point across um and then we can think going A Step Beyond that um can we try to form messages as questions so this is an example this is the kind of this is the way that we were testing some messages in focus groups it was like meant to,20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,20:57,emulate sort of a social media ad that people might see um and it's talking about a hypothetical ballot measure issue that people might be voting on and this was a message that went through a couple iterations so the first so I'll just read it for a second whatever the industry might claim I don't think anybody with a heart in their chest can watch the videos from slaughter houses and not feel disgusted animals deserve freedom from Slaughter we focus on our freedom but what about theirs the first version of this message ended with animals deserve freedom from Slaughter um or it this is like this was years ago so I used to be able to say this off the cuff but it didn't end with a question and people so this is a pretty strong emotional message right having just said this thing about you know people perceive this as as perceive us a sort of O overly emotional this is an overt this message is overtly about emotions um and the first version of this message didn't go over very well it definitely encounter that kind of objection um but when the the change that made this message pretty successful,21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,21:59,one change that made this message pretty successful was adding this rhetorical question at the end um and it's a pretty obvious obviously rhetorical question right it's not you know and there's it's pretty clear what the speaker thinks the answer to that question should be but but it's still we found that to be really effective as an invitation to the reader or The Listener um to put themselves in the situation and let them connect to the dots and it just using questions helps people feel like rather than like I'm being lectured at you know there's I'm involved in this and I'm I'm making the I'm reaching my own conclusions so that's one strategy um another is to let pictures make that emotional connection and again this goes with kind of toning down our emotional language can we rely on pictures to create the emotional connection and then use language that's not going to come across as manipulative with the caveat that as I said even images can be seen by a lot of the people we were talking to as manipulative so so showing footage of Slaughter the at the most extreme moments um that was seen in on the other,22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,23:05,hand encouraging you know Finding was that just pictures of cute animals I mean so uh I think the next there's one there's another message that we tested that was just this this exact picture of this adorable little cow with his tongue sticking out um and it just just paired with a message something like we want to live or we don't want to be killed um we didn't you know that message was really melted through the defenses of the people that in our focus groups so they uh you know where it is essentially something to the like we don't need to rely on Slaughter image these images of animals thriving can get the point across people you know in response to that footage it wasn't just like oh he's so cute it was like oh I that's a I can't argue with that that's a really you know they're right I shouldn't you know they don't want to die so that's one thing and the other kind of image that we recommend using so if Slaughter images are kind of,23
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,24:07,too intense for a lot of people bring up that defensiveness really strongly are seen as manipulative there's this other kind of image um that doesn't BR have that same reaction which is sort of posts Slaughter images where an animal's body is partway between like meat as it looks packaged on a grocery store shelf and a living animal um and it doesn't have that immediate you know feeling that it's like shock value or something um so it feels more kind of factual but it helps it makes that connection which so many people are like we said trying to avoid thinking about the connection between animals and meat um so as an example on this next slide I'm going to show one it's you know it is a little graphic [Music] um this is you know this it so this brings up disgust which is something that we talk more about and like I said encourage to check out on the website I flashed earlier um disgust is a is a powerful tool for us to use and there's a close link between kind of moral disgust and like,24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,25:09,just visceral physical disgust which this is kind of image brings up even for people who do eat meat because it's you know halfway between the meat product and the animal and then the last strategy that I want to sort of focus on for the rest of my time and talk about um some rcts that have examined this is just explicitly appealing to emotion so if this if these Rea if a reaction a lot a common reaction to a message you know that's using a lot like give an example what I mean when I'm talking about like adverbs you know something like animals and factory farms you know are subjected to horrific torture these factory farms are concentration camps and you know torture chambers and you know using all these like really charged words that are meant to appeal to emotion brings up this response of emotional manipulation or you know hysterical overly emotional um a different strategy is to ex so if that's like an implicit appeal to emotion this,25
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,26:11,strategy is an explicit appeal to emotion so the quote and I have to say this is not an actual quote from James Cromwell we just we we're experimenting with different messages so we tried attributing it to a a famous actor that people might recognize um but the quote itself if you have an emotional reaction to seeing footage of animals suffering ins slide slaughter houses that's a good sign that you're a human being feeling anguish about what these animals go through that's useful information we should listen to that so this is explicitly inviting people into that emotion and saying so this brings up a this going back to the idea of framing this is an idea that people are familiar with they've probably encountered in the world that hey actually emotions are good like and those are important things it's a whole person is someone who's in touch with their emotions and can you know listen to them without being controlled by them but bringing up that frame count this is a really effective counter to that oh you know don't try to manipulate my emotions,26
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,27:10,thing it's saying No this is these your emotional reaction to this footage I'm not telling you what you know what emotions to have I'm just saying your emotional reaction that's that's something we should listen to um and most people of course have the the same emotional reaction to seeing this footage so this was in our focus groups qualitative research this was a really effective message um but in it's really actually risen to the this was one of you know many different rhetorical strategies that that we came out of our focus groups recommending and again I suggest you check them out on the website but um in some rcts that we've done since then that this sort of explicit emotional appeal has really risen to the top of the pile so we've been working with a very cool firm called rhetorical um which is a small just group of guys who are helping particularly Animal Advocates do design,27
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,28:10,large scale messaging studies with a really interesting method and so what their approach is is they ask first they do a we do a small study where we just ask a bunch of members of the public to write the message that they think would be most effective for a particular outcome so in this case we were m me measuring the effect of messages on support for a slaughterhouse ban as a ballot measure at the Statewide level in the US because that's something that we're sort of pursuing we're currently pursuing a slaughterous band at the city level in Denver Colorado um but we we that's something we could do at the state level as well and so that was kind of the proxy we were using as a as just general support for pro animal policies so we asked first we asked a bunch of members of the public to write messages themselves what do they think would be the strongest message and in a lot of different kind of Prior research um we've seen that the best crowdsource messages often outperform the best expert messages and this makes sense going back to this a lot of what our point was in the focus groups was figure out you know how are people how are,28
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,29:12,Ordinary People thinking about this and so a lot of our messages like the ones that I flashed before actually this was these two messages were kind of um partly cobbled together by things that people were saying in our own focus groups because we thought that that sort of lay person how how lay people are thinking about this would be a great way to create messages that really resonate with people so and that definitely held true in our that thing before about like um crowdsource messages outperforming a lot of expert messages so in an initial version of this experiment we included a lot of messages from different animal Advocate groups um like look using their kind of press releases or websites or social media ads and things to uh create messages are representative of current messaging strategies in the movement and then we mixed that with messaging strategies that were coming out of our qualitative research as well as messaging messages that were just directly crowdsourced in this RCT and so,29
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,30:12,then we go from that initial batch of crowdsource messages to a large scale RCT where we put test all those messages against each other and this was the second round of that so we'd already um we do that first RCT we'd wi out a bunch of we'd taken basically the top performers and then went again into a second round where we show those top performers to members of the public and said given that these messages have done well in the past now again write a message that you think will be good and the listen to your emotions message was one of the strongest messages in the whole out of these two rounds so if the control was you know 52% support for the slos ban um this one clocked about 56.7 or no what is that 57.2% for the support um but all the messages Above This Were overtly welfarist so it's true that on in an short immediate sense of like a in this very limited context of an RCT um where people are just shown a message and then asked you know how they would support a measure the mo the most,30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,31:12,popular messages were people's familiar way of thinking about this which is um you know there's a better way to do this slaughter houses instead of slaughter houses we should rely on local Family Farms and not only is that maybe not the message that we're trying to deliver it's also just factually inaccurate you know there's no we wouldn't we would still have slaughter houses if we had local Family Farms okay so but then so what's really exciting about this listen to your emotions message is the top performing message that kind of feels like it's a fit with the values of the animal R movement and you know is also kind of factually accurate in terms of the issue that we're talking about okay I think that's yeah so I'll just this is to flash that again this is the version that we came in now are testing in the rcds if you have an emotional reaction to seeing footage of animals suffering inside slaughter houses that's a good sign to your human being feeling anguish about what these animals go through that's useful information we should listen to that this initiative is on the right side of History so just explicitly inviting people into that emotion it seems to be very powerful okay so um we're gonna pause and just have time,31
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,32:16,for I think hopefully a bit of a longer Q&A all right thank you so much for that Oden we have a question from chatan uh do you have any studies related to the property status of animals um one thing we definitely were interested in in our in the qualitative research was the current paradigms in animal Advocate messaging we sort of you know I mean we're all very familiar with this conflict between like welfare versus rights messaging welfare versus rights messaging so welfare messaging I probably I don't need to explain that for everyone on this call um we found that neither the the welfare Paradigm as we know it or the rights Paradigm reflects how the general public thinks about this issue and they're both pretty impenetrable to people so on the one hand welfare messaging is pretty like which is not to say that welfare campaigns aren't useful,32
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,33:16,or that there's not a good place for them but when we're thinking about how we're engaging with the public the weal messages about welfare or information about welfare was pretty uninspiring so we saw things like you know people saying cage free a lot of people are skeptical of some of those minor welfare reforms certainly when they're provided with information about what those reforms mean the response is like well why would I get off my ass and you know vote for something like that's just so trivial why would I like it's not worth my attention on the other like which so we might as advocates think that those campaigns are worthwhile but for the public it's not the best kind of angle we can use on the other hand rights messaging literally does cause like a lot of people to think what does that mean there's going to be like elephants voting or in courtrooms you know representing like it's it's a very alien way for people to think about that,33
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,34:16,so the personhood or the property status thing my sense coming out of that is it takes so much it explaining of why that's kind of the important thing for us there might be a setting where we are trying to educate the public about what property status versus personhood even means before we're then saying why it's a problem that animals have property status inste of personhood and make the case like that's such a long information dense argument to make there might be a time that we're trying to make that that in a lot of situations as advocates we don't have that much time with people and I my suggestion would be that the property status kind of angle is not going to connect with people very easily when we don't have all the time to sort of convey that hole does that kind of get it the question we're leaving participants muted for uh good reasons okay but if I see anything in the chat I'll um out um we have a question from uh,34
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,35:24,Jasper yeah okay I see jper questions so straight facts didn't do well but there are some types of facts that did better than others yes so facts were important it's I definitely recommend including facts in your message we also need to make that like without emotion facts aren't interesting um but facts definitely one of our top findings is you know including a fact in every message definitely strengthens every message and I love the way you ask the question are there some types of facts that did better than others numerical facts so I think what including a fact does in your message the most important thing that it's doing is basically providing a kind of authority to what you're saying um so the best way like in most cases people don't have enough information so we know that the facts about animal agriculture are very damning but most members of the public don't have enough context around these issues to contextualize those facts in a meaningful way so for instance about climate change if we're saying animal agriculture is you know 14.5 % of,35
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,36:28,greenhouse gases or whatever other number it is for most people who aren't like steeped in this in that in the topic of climate change that's the number itself is not actually very meaningful but providing a number just having a number makes your makes you sound a lot more trustworthy and authoritative it like you you're showing that you've done your research and people value that a lot even if that's you know what they'll not exactly what they'll say on the surface so a factual a n a numerical fact is very strong and within numbers I would recommend leaning on the conservative side of any range of numbers so if there's debate about you know how what percentage of ghgs are caused by animal agriculture leaning on the conservative side meaning like the lower-end estimate um trust that you know even 14.5% is it seems very substantial to people that you know that's what we found and on the other hand if you air on the high side and they later hear something contradict that that will kind of undermine your credibility so it's go on the safe side,36
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,37:31,trust that those numbers are good enough and then provide a citation so the two the strongest types of facts numbers numbers on maybe the low end of the spectrum and then provide a citation um and again in whatever different messaging context you're talking about people probably aren't going to go look it up but you giving them the chance to look it up you know makes them feel like you're engaging with them you know as more respectfully like you're you're respect in their kind of intellectual capacities to say oh well this study done by Harvard and this year or whatever um where you're giving them enough information that they can go check fact check it provides you with your message with a lot of authority and I would just challenge yeah absolutely in every me like even in messages that are just about you know the intelligence of animals or you know what you know just that don't seem like things that are kind of messages that are more about emotion than fact I mean so for instance with the emotion response message we're now in practice when we're using that we're pairing it with a fact about what percentage of,37
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,38:33,Americans agree with that um or like in our case we did a poll in Denver and so it's you know 84% of Denver voters agree that animals in under human care shouldn't be subject to violence and exploitation or whatever you know I think something like that so just having being able to include a numerical fact in any message even if it's not a message you normally think of as like a fact-based message or or sort of you know databased argument definitely recommend that thanks aen um had a question from Katie she says thanks for the great presentation uh could you expand on shifting to a Civic framework and how to combat utility related specific with so like Civic engagement so the idea that a single vote doesn't matter yeah so great question um certainly a lot of people I mean I'm speaking in the US context there are a lot of people in the US who feel pretty disengaged from politics um feel like their vote doesn't matter um so that's,38
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,39:36,it's interesting that we found in these conversations that that's so much you know I think people felt the key I think the key difference um well so okay so people did seem to feel much more of a sense of power or ability to influence the world through a Civic frame than through a consumer frame um it's true that you know there are people who feel like their vote doesn't matter but I think even it's much more clear to more people that their consumer choices aren't you know shaping the world um and I think the key difference is just like people you know between these two options between thinking about your your vote and thinking about your your vote with your dollar kind of thing um the Civic frame is so much more one reason that it's working is not just that it's providing a pathway to change like it's oh yeah if we vote differently conceivably this thing Could Happen um it's also just a role where people think about society as a whole acting rather than individuals so so much of yeah when people think,39
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,40:41,about their vote let me give an like an an example of an issue where people are very used to thinking of it as a policy thing even though it's in in a lot of ways similar problems is Healthcare so Healthcare is a product that people shop around for and buy um just like they shop around for animal animal products and buy them or food products and buy them but people are used to thinking them in completely different ways they we think of at least in the United States we think of healthcare as primary well it's funny because I guess in the UK Healthcare is not a product right but um here you know people are think primarily of healthcare as a policy issue they're totally used to hearing politicians talk about Healthcare they're very used to thinking about the role that government plays that big corporations and their policy decisions play and what options are available to me and that's not how people think about food they think oh I go to the grocery store and there's just Endless Options and I can choose whatever I want so bringing in that Civic frame one thing it does is just bring in oh okay there's government policy decisions and there's policy,40
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,41:45,decisions of major of like huge corporations are actually shaping the choices that I have available to me or the choices that I'm more likely to make because of price and things just bringing that kind of awareness in a just brings so much more support to the idea that like okay this is a problem that needs to be solved on a social level um and that's a huge step forward if we encounter kind of Civic futility you know I that is it's like a new challenge but it's a it feels like progress to me compared to Consumer futility now I'll say specifically in our context I think something that goes even further um what something you know that about half the states in the US have I know there's other countries in the world Switzerland recently did one of these so citizen initiated ballot measures um are a this like direct democracy process that I think really helps with Civic futility people feel a lot like giving people the option hey as voters you know first you can sign this,41
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,42:46,petition and then as a voter if we get enough petitions it'll be on the ballot and as a voter you'll get to vote on it directly on policy um you know I think the sense of futility around civics is like hey whichever party wins they're all just owned by you know rich people and it doesn't matter but whereas voting directly on policy that's what we hear a lot is like that exactly that thing of oh wow like we can actually we as Citizens can actually you know take control in this way we can you know we can say what we want and make it happen unfortunately that's like a really limited answer and so actually that I think that's the main I kind of alluded to this earlier but the main challenge that I am interested in right now is how can what are other ways besides ballot measures which are very limited and where and when we can use them that we can um engage the public in their role as like citizens voters rather than as consumers so any ideas I'd love to hear them well um I'm actually going to abuse my hosts power here and jump the queue with a question um how so I'm I'm kind of interested in like do you think the,42
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,43:51,consumer frame like the narrative um that that narrative like has helped the movement so far and if it still has a place and also um like have you seen any examples of the the Civic frame like act like being used in the movement like in action so okay first to the Civic frame I mean certainly there are there's press I'm going to answer the second part of the question first there's certainly examples going back you know where the public encountered the issue of animal rights in the political realm um for instance prop 12 in California which was the big ballot measure in 2018 or before it prop 2 in 2008 um which you know required cage free for you know band cages for hens and mother pigs and um V caps uh you know welfare reform that but,43

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,45:57,organizing to say hey I've got all these voters in your District on my mailing list whove told me that they want to vote for candidates who support animals and so if you pass this policy that I'm proposing then I'm going to tell all these voters that you were Pro animal and they'll vote for you but if you don't I'm going to tell them you weren't and they'll I'll tell them to vote for your opponent um so that's been another effective way that the kind of Civic frame has been used on I would love to see how can we get the public more involved in this kind of Civic advocacy in places where ballot measures aross um but those are like some starting examples to the first question is there still room for the consumer frame you know I think to start with there was I'm I I'm inclined to think that there was a point in the history of the movement where you know it wouldn't have been possible to imagine even for activist much less for members of the general public this that you know the the state is going to come in and use state power to transition Society away from farming animals so at that point the you know thinking about well what can we do as,45
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,47:03,individuals we can start this way I think probably was like absolutely necessary um is there still room for it I think there probably is I'm not quite ready to say that there's no place to be talking to members of the public about their consumer choices um I you know I'm I think we can all and I'm sure there are probably people who have you know already thought this through and are like whatever come on man I thought this through years ago but um I don't see that there's a credible Pathway to you know dramatic change for animals in society through like cons one consumer at a time but we can think about you know okay if that's not true what do we need you know vegans for you know vegans are acting as like a Vanguard group that are demonstrating that this kind of change is possible and you know a proof of concept of the kind of world that we're advocating for and more vegans makes that proof of concept more compelling even though it's we don't think that it's you know the,46
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,48:08,ultimate way that we're going to change is going from you know five to 10 to just this gradual increase in the number of vegans through individual education um we can still think that using individual education right now to increase the number of vegans strengthens this kind of Vanguard concept that's kind of what I'm playing with right now but it's you know I don't feel super like I have a great answer to that fair enough may not but thank you thank you very much um I'm gonna combine two questions now kind of on the same theme from James and Beth so um James has asked um so he's wondering about uh how people's emotions about the suffering of animals competes against their emotional attachment to events or festivals that involve eating animals um so you know how much does the suffering of the turkey weigh up against the tradition of having a a turkey at uh Thanksgiving or Christmas and then Beth sort of in the same uh vein said like,47
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,49:10,what messaging would you recommend around eating turkeys at Thanksgiving or not as the case may be uh you know okay I'm going to qualify this by saying this is just like my thought in this moment in response to this question and hey not only something I haven't thought a lot about but also something that it's not like I'm not saying I have the backing of a bunch of research to the claim that I'm about to make but you're asking me so um my inclination is to think that you know yeah Thanksgiving is probably not the most fertile ground for us to be advocating to people on it's like like that's like the hard you know that's like a bigger that's just like the hardest place we can be going is hey like don't eat a turkey on Thanksgiving yeah the culture stuff is very strong these cult these objections and justifications based on culture and tradition um are very strong I think there's a lot of people who are probably willing to say yeah I'll you know dramatically cut back on meat all the time except for Thanksgiving and Christmas or you know,48
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,50:10,hey I will um I'm willing to like support some pretty transformational kind of policy shifts um that are going to set us on a course towards ending animal farming but in the meantime I'm definitely going to eat turkey on Thanksgiving and I'm not even really interested in you telling you know so that's kind of the world I'm in is like I I'm I see that there's all this latent support in the public that we are failing to tap into and I don't think that the pathway to that is through like Thanksgiving so I'm personally planning to not really just I'm just going to let that go and it's like okay you know I mean a lot of turkeys are killed on Thanksgiving are killed to be eaten on Thanksgiving but a lot of animals are killed to to be eaten every I mean I'm not sure that it's like dramatically different than the number of chickens that are killed to be eaten every day or something so that's I don't know maybe that's a cop up I don't think so I think it was a,49
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,51:09,interest think it was an interesting answer um I I'll start to think about sort of winding the questions down now as we've only got five minutes before the end of the session so I'll just throw in one from James and see how far we get so James says I'd be interested in doing some groups AB testing or even RCT with WTF groups using different messaging Civic framew Etc and messaging the impact using the data we already collect so James is essentially interested if the current suggestions are based heavily on a US context or is there a strong basis that they'd work in other places as well so definitely we were very conscious as we were doing this research so we were only using a US population I might have to sneeze in a second here sorry um I think there are some things that probably apply well to at least like I'm pretty confident that what we're talking about would work in you know close cultural anglophone countries,50
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,52:12,to the US like Canada and the UK I think most of what we're talking about would work in those situations so have um I have a friend who works doing has done some qualitative research in a and specifically with a focus in China with the good growth Crow If anyone started them they're doing great work shout them out um and talking to her about what they've sort of encountered in China I'm suspecting that it doesn't translate very well so like some key differences and and I know very little about like the Indonesian context James or obviously I know you're you're concerned with like worldwide organizing so um one thing is that in a lot of places like in the US there's you can think of it in terms of like stages of progress that we're at I mentioned in the US most people we talked to have already seen footage of slaughter houses and they're pretty well aware that like factory farming represents a substantial percentage of food production in the United States now we have these survey results that most people think that you,51
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,53:15,know the meat they buy is Humane I think that those are probably accurate um but it's a pretty small Gap to close to say okay you're aware that factory farming and industrial slaughter houses are a major part of half food is produced here in the US now here's just a data point from the USDA 99% of animals live in those contexts raised in the US so like that that's an easier Gap to close whereas I think in a lot of countries um where factory farming is newer or is only currently in process most people you know correctly or incorrectly don't think that factory farming is the main way that food is produced or even is even significant you know significantly common in their country um a lot of people so like for instance the China context I mentioned um they found that the most receptive age group to like Animal Welfare messages were older people and they found that that was true because older people mostly have lived like most people of that generation in China actually have lived on farms or have lived in villages where you know they,52
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,54:18,maybe they don't anymore but as kids they lived around farms and saw you know non-factory farms and so that's that just presents different challenges so I think some of this yeah I think it's yeah there's things that will and won't translate and I think anyone operating in any particular country will be a better judge of what probably translates from our research um than I would thank you very much Aiden I'll have to there's lots more questions but I'll have to sort of draw it to a close now as we get towards the end of the session um yeah thank you very much for that that was brilliant uh despite the few little hiccups that we had um I just want to use this final minute to uh basically push our next webinar uh that's okay yeah so this is uh the lovely Rob and he's in charge of the quantitative side of our narrative research and testing animal think TCH um,53
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m6Dhrk--E,The Emotion - Persuasion Balance: Insights from Pax Fauna,Animal Think Tank,31 Oct 2023,55:21,and next month uh he'll be doing a deep dive in into the animal Freedom movements narrative history um it should be a really entertaining session but it's going to be a really important one too because um we think that learning from the past is the best way to empower the present we don't have a sign up link for next month's webinar yet but just keep an eye on animal Think Tank socials and our bright page um to get information on how to sign up so thank you very much everybody thanks very much to you agan as well yeah thanks again for having me Beth it's been great,54

I'd like to live a long life so I thought I'd do some research. So I looked up the top ten leading causes of death in the US. And you know what? All the things people worry about like homicides, drugs, and terrorism weren't even in there.",1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSLzTeh6OqU,Homicide Or Hamburgers: Which Is The Biggest Killer?,Generation Vegan,1 Dec 2019,0:19,"But because people worry about them we made this pie chart to show all these causes of death and how big a deal they are. So it turns out the two biggest killers in our country can be caused by what we eat. That's heart disease, which kills more than 30% of our citizens and cancer, which kills another 30%. Strokes and diabetes can also be affected by what we eat, and these account for another 4.9% and 3.8% respectively.",2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSLzTeh6OqU,Homicide Or Hamburgers: Which Is The Biggest Killer?,Generation Vegan,1 Dec 2019,0:46,"Now from what we see on television and in the movies such as the news, cop shows, and murder mysteries you'd think we should be worrying about violence. But homicides actually account for less than 1% of all deaths, and for terrorism it's less than .01%. There isn't even a piece for terrorism because it's such a low figure. But now take a look at this... These are the leading causes of death",3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSLzTeh6OqU,Homicide Or Hamburgers: Which Is The Biggest Killer?,Generation Vegan,1 Dec 2019,1:12,"that people search for online. A totally different picture, right? People are interested in finding out about cancer but not so much about heart disease, and they're way more interested in violent deaths. Nearly one quarter of searches are about these even though they account for just 3% of deaths. I have another question Is what we actually die from reflected in the media coverage in a proportionate way?",4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSLzTeh6OqU,Homicide Or Hamburgers: Which Is The Biggest Killer?,Generation Vegan,1 Dec 2019,1:38,"Ourworldindata.org looked at the New York Times as an example, although the results from The Guardian were very similar. It found that violent deaths such as homicide and suicide account for around one-third of all media coverage and terrorism accounts for a whopping 35.8%. Overall, violent forms of death account for more than two-thirds of coverage, but they actually count for less than 3% of all deaths. Now I'm just a teenager,",5

News channels can make us think the world is scarier than it really is, and it can forget what's truly important. And if we're going to make America healthy again, we should all be taking our own health much more seriously. So to help beat those leading causes of death in our country like heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes, the science says we need to eat a lot less meat,",6

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZjrnv4qcBo,Being an Arab Vegan | Ghanim Al-Sulaiti,Generation Vegan,3 Jul 2024,0:00,so I became vegan almost 10 years ago my journey started back when I was living in the states I got introduced to veganism through a book that was talking about how food can change the way we look and we feel the Beauty detox by Kimberly Snider it was talking a lot about eating more fruits and vegetables that's how I became more interested in knowing more,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZjrnv4qcBo,Being an Arab Vegan | Ghanim Al-Sulaiti,Generation Vegan,3 Jul 2024,0:24,about food and nutrition aware of what where my food is coming from and what should I be eating and consuming and then veganism kind of followed that of course when it comes to the challenges of going you know vegan you know especially being a person from the Middle East uh and Living in Qatar I became very much aware that I needed to create alternative options for myself to,2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZjrnv4qcBo,Being an Arab Vegan | Ghanim Al-Sulaiti,Generation Vegan,3 Jul 2024,0:46,continue on this lifestyle of veganism but also you know being bombarded by you know questions from different people like you know my family my friends constantly asking why I'm going vegan is it healthier for us so I had to educate myself a lot going vegan for me was enriching because I immediately felt the amazing digestion I used to get sick more often,3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZjrnv4qcBo,Being an Arab Vegan | Ghanim Al-Sulaiti,Generation Vegan,3 Jul 2024,1:09,and I now I don't I think after going vegan I realized that I have more energy and I have more power actually to to to give so I started running I started attending marathons started doing yoga and I started kind of doing lots of different activities when I went vegan a lot of my family they thought I'm crazy after opening and launching,4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZjrnv4qcBo,Being an Arab Vegan | Ghanim Al-Sulaiti,Generation Vegan,3 Jul 2024,1:30,Evergreen my first business they've been adapting lots of vegan food into their lifestyle my dad started juicing and adding lots of nice you know vegan snacks here and there my mom became vegan until 5:00 so she's vegan for breakfast and lunch my brother became vegetarian my friends became vegetarians it was for me very important to see the impact that a small decision of mine had,5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZjrnv4qcBo,Being an Arab Vegan | Ghanim Al-Sulaiti,Generation Vegan,3 Jul 2024,1:51,on so many different people around me we launched the business in 2016 with no vegan markets people don't know what vegan is today we have just set up the first vegan Festival in the country in cooperation with big [Music] entities being a katari and being born and raised in Doha I know how people eat,6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZjrnv4qcBo,Being an Arab Vegan | Ghanim Al-Sulaiti,Generation Vegan,3 Jul 2024,2:20,here and how far it is from eating vegan food and I had to go and dig deeper and see how people ate in Doha I would say 100 years ago they didn't eat animal product as much because meat wasn't accessible people here in Doha used to eat lots of SAR vegetables lots of beans and and Grains and I started to connect and open the conversation with people here in DHA,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZjrnv4qcBo,Being an Arab Vegan | Ghanim Al-Sulaiti,Generation Vegan,3 Jul 2024,2:45,to say I'm not trying to bring a westernized uh idea being mainly plan-based is actually something that comes from within our heritage and and our culture and it's not something that's coming from abroad so I think people started reimagining how vegan food is meant to be my goal was to get to every school out there and you know University and,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZjrnv4qcBo,Being an Arab Vegan | Ghanim Al-Sulaiti,Generation Vegan,3 Jul 2024,3:07,and that's what I've done for the past few years because I've seen the difference these conversations have had on the total uh dialogue that we wanted to create on veganism what keeps me excited to continue this conversation and to continue sharing it with many people is is the impact that I think it it can leave on people you know not just change,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZjrnv4qcBo,Being an Arab Vegan | Ghanim Al-Sulaiti,Generation Vegan,3 Jul 2024,3:30,their lifestyle but also change their perception and I've added a little bit of value somewhere it's the impact that I can create with my simple action I've traveled across the Middle East to explore not only the different Cuisines that the Middle East have to offer but also the fruits and vegetables that are being grown in our region and I realized that people in Morocco are,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZjrnv4qcBo,Being an Arab Vegan | Ghanim Al-Sulaiti,Generation Vegan,3 Jul 2024,3:55,mainly plant-based people in Jordan are mainly plant-based and I'm not saying people living in the city when I went outside of the city and me met people in their farms and you know in their different Villages I found that they are depending so much on on grains and nuts and seeds and beans and and lots of vegetables from their Farms it's a completely different perception from,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZjrnv4qcBo,Being an Arab Vegan | Ghanim Al-Sulaiti,Generation Vegan,3 Jul 2024,4:14,what uh people think the Middle East uh eats and I started sharing it with people here and saying hey look at this that are 100% Kari dishes that are naturally vegan but people would never think they are vegan because they just don't connect the term vegan with with anything that has comes from the culture but you know our cultures are based on on flavors and spices and things that,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZjrnv4qcBo,Being an Arab Vegan | Ghanim Al-Sulaiti,Generation Vegan,3 Jul 2024,4:36,are authentic and real that comes from the from the soil anything that you can grow is definitely going to be a plant we have definitely veganized a lot of traditional qari dishes all my restaurants now are offering katari vegan food same flavor same spices same taste but veganized veganism and sustainability are very much linked a lot of people are,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZjrnv4qcBo,Being an Arab Vegan | Ghanim Al-Sulaiti,Generation Vegan,3 Jul 2024,5:00,not speaking about the impact that food has not on our body but also on the planet my hopes of course is for the future to bring more opportunities for not only healthy food to grow but also for a more conscious Society more open for conversations more ready to be a little bit uh challenged I would say and we are on that track when you go vegan you go for three,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZjrnv4qcBo,Being an Arab Vegan | Ghanim Al-Sulaiti,Generation Vegan,3 Jul 2024,5:24,reasons for the animals or you go for the planets or you go for your health those three aspects have changed my life so for the animal I've became more aware about what I use in terms of my products so I stopped using leather I've changed my car so now it's vegan I became so aware of what I consume and how it's linked to the Animal Welfare um when it comes to the planet I became more,15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZjrnv4qcBo,Being an Arab Vegan | Ghanim Al-Sulaiti,Generation Vegan,3 Jul 2024,5:45,conscious on how sustainability is linked to the food we consume on a daily basis and of course the third aspect is health and that's the importance and the benefits of how your body is reacting to certain foods and uh the more you free your body from you know digesting food the more you give it the chance to spread that energy somewhere else in your body,16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,0:03,[Music] hello everyone welcome to another edition of connecting the dots i'm your host navy jaswal the founder of the versa foundation and the divinity research program connecting the dots is all about whole food plant-based living intersectional veganism and matters key to public and planetary health today we have the wonderful dr leila kasim with us she has a deep background in international development is an acclaimed author a vegan activist and a co-founder of the animal think tank in the uk welcome uh leila to the show thank you navy it's lovely to be here okay so let's start uh with your personal story how did you go vegan oh well i think um that was in well i'll start in 2010 i started meditating and i'm getting really interested in spirituality and i'm wanting to live a non-violent life,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,1:33,and to live a mindful life and a conscious life so yeah i started meditating and um when it came to eating a burger or a steak i would look at my plate and suddenly for the first time see what it actually was which was the corpse of a tortured animal um so i went vegetarian um and it took me i'm ashamed to say three years to kind of you know fully realize that you know the dairy industry and the egg industry is all part of the same oppressive violence system um and so i went vegan three years later and as it happens when i when i went vegetarian i was actually i just started my phd um and i was looking at the impact of fish farming on poverty in in ghana and so i think there was this kind of thing in my head which was like well you know i i'm sort of looking at animal exploitation for a good thing um and it's like i feel like i couldn't quite make the step to veganism and and when i handed in my phd was then i went,2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,2:37,vegan and so i think something shifted unconsciously in my mind so yeah that was um that was quite a while ago now yeah well thank you so much uh about sharing uh for sharing that and you mentioned that you were doing your phd and um you were already invested in this you know big academic program obviously you weren't vegan but you achieved this vegan consciousness sometime during that time that that's really interesting um like did that involve changing the topic of your research or did you just end up blending it somehow in and bringing your vegan ethic to the work that you were doing back then no i mean so so throughout my phd i was vegetarian um and i you know i was when i was in ghana doing my field research i was i was going to fish farms and i was watching them being harvested and i you know i just so i mean i wasn't,3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,3:35,eating fish and i just it was it was so difficult because i was like but i'm working with poor farmers they don't have a choice at least that's what i thought at the time so somehow i just kind of um i don't know i just contained it or thought well i have the privilege they don't have the privilege and to a certain extent i still i still believe that i think we've we've all got different abilities or different barriers to being able to live in alignment with our values um and yeah so once i'd finished and i've gone vegan i i became like this expert in fish farming in africa for poverty and food security and that was how i was making my living so i carried on consulting on these projects which were focused on food security and poverty but through things like fish farming and i carried on um for a few years increa just getting increasingly more um upset and disgusted and and for many more reasons than just the sort of my vegan ethic i was also um really feeling that the whole development industry was immoral and,4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,4:38,neocolonial um and so in 2017 so i guess like four years after i'd gone vegan i just thought i can't do this anymore i can't do it anymore and i i just i've stopped and luckily my partner's amazing and he was like finally finally you you've come to your senses um yeah and i i ended up spending about six months um in bed reading and um trying to put all of the jigsaw pieces together of like my animal liberation kind of ethics what i'd been experiencing in development and kind of like human oppression and also you know making the connections with our destruction of the natural world so um that was a real you know ending my development career and then taking space to really reflect on my experiences over the last 15 years was a really really important and like it was an inflection point in my life really right clearly and and then you started working on a project which was a book project you you're an acclaimed author,5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,5:37,you co-authored this book with uh with your father um dr amir kassam and uh i'm just gonna pull it up on the screen um rethinking food and agriculture and and this is i've had the you know opportunity and and the honor of reading this book uh written by you and dr custom um and what i found amazing was this is one of those unique books where you read about international development you read about food systems food transformation but you also read about animal ethics and veganism and whole food plant-based and veganic farming now now that's something unique and that's the first tell us about this tell us about this project well um firstly nivia i think you're the only one who acclaims me as an author i am i i really don't even i don't like that label because i mean i co-edited that book with my father and it's filled with um chapters from amazing forward-thinking activists and academics,6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,6:38,and and practitioners and there's so much wisdom in that book and it was just such a a privilege to be able to bring to help to bring that together um and so this sort of i often say that it's the book that i wanted to read and i couldn't find um and you know i in that period of when i sort of like decided to end my career in development and and sort of you know try and connect the dots between all these issues i was reading amazing books but just on like one aspect on animal liberation on food system transformation which didn't include an animal liberation ethic um except and and like environmental issues that didn't include um you know domesticated animals in in their circle of like moral concern so um yeah it's the book that i wanted to read but couldn't find um and it it brings together animal liberation perspectives on on development as,7

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,8:40,together some of my favorite voices um from different sectors yeah i do remember you know reading another chapter which i believe uh you co-authored along with jim mason and and that talks about impact of domestication historically yeah yeah i mean so first of all the chapter was really by jim it's based on his 1993 book called an unnatural order and that was one of the books that i read when i was sitting in bed trying to work out what you know how to view the world and it i would highly recommend it to everyone it's just such a powerful book and it looks that you know how we were more than ten thousand years ago before settled agriculture as sort of forager hunters or mainly foragers um and and the impact of of when we started domesticating other animals and herding other animals and the kind of um the social stratification,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,9:37,that came about because of that you know um if we the mentality of oppressing and exploiting other animals was kind of um you know soon we started to view women the way that we used to you know that we that we currently view livestock in inverted commerce as breeders and um and and and also in terms of you know developing class and wealth categories and and um the herding culture he talks about is very expansionary by necessity because of the land and water that's constantly needed because it's very degrading and so it requires sort of war and and and yeah claiming other you know claiming land and um uh and resources from others so there's so much that has come about because of our domestication of other animals that i just i don't see um in many places or is even like acknowledged and i think that's so much of part of the root causes actually of,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,10:40,the multiple interconnected crisis that we're facing right now i mean our domestication of other around like okay um capitalism the word capital you know it comes from like heads cows the word for war comes from you know sanskrit for um desire for more cows i mean it's so entangled with how we you know with our current society and how we've set it up that um it's really really fascinating yeah yeah and you're you're so right you know so our monetary system our uh you know i don't know rules of kinship um you know inheritance all of those somehow and and our definitions of progress right so when we talk about sustainable development goals and all of that international development vocabulary it just uh feels as though it's very extractive in mindset um and and we want to value extract out of things and we then ascribe profit to that and and in doing so we become delusioned about what might be the,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,11:43,actual purpose of what it is that we're trying to accomplish um so you co-founded animal think tank to set a lot of those things right tell us about animal think tank right well i mean animal think tank is looking at that is really looking at the animal liberation piece um and we um our mission is to support the building of a powerful and broad-based social movement for animal freedom in the uk and we are working towards a world where all individual animals have their rights to life liberty and um security of person protected both in law and embraced and respected by society so we're really trying to bring about both legislative so structural change and cultural change a shift in consciousness i mean ultimately i think what we're trying to do i mean i don't know if other people in animal think tank agree with me but i think i feel that we're trying to change,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,12:43,ultimately our relationship with other animals um and come back into right relationship with other animals and also ourselves and each other and the natural world it is all connected um so yeah so we we uh co-founded me and two others co-founded this a few years ago um we spent a year uh the three of us in in a living room workshopping ideas and then we we got some funding and we started to grow um and yeah we're now seven and we're recruiting for another four currently so by 2023 we're aiming to grow to about 30. and basically what we're about is is um we want to seed a social movement organization for other animals and i often explain it like if you think of extinction rebellion we're doing the same for animal freedom and with extinction rebellion you know a group of them spent 18 months conceptualizing um the dna of their movement the,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,13:45,principles and values the strategy etc and we're kind of in that stage at the moment all right and and you have uh uh openings so people who around the world are welcome to uh you know apply i'm just gonna put that on the screen tell us a little bit about these roles that you have yeah um so we are we are expanding right now um and so we've got uh and i should say that uh i think the deadline has passed for all of them now um we've started interviewing this week so we've got we we're recruiting for a political strategist um a social movement culture lead and you know that's that's kind of my area i look after culture in the organization and you know so what is that what is the culture of our movement going to be what are the principles and values what are the conflict transformation systems um the care systems all of those sorts of things um what other two a corpus,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,14:41,linguist who is going to help us with our narrative work and um the final one oh lead coordinator probably the most high impact role um so in a kind of normal organization this would be i guess the ceo like i suppose at the moment we're kind of um we're bored but even though we're not we're not um what's word structured in a traditional way but um yeah so we're looking for a lead coordinator as well um and we've had some amazing applicants um and honestly i'm just like we don't we we we are a volunteer based organization we have um a needs-based salary so it's not like what you would get in an ngo we're quite you know we don't want to become an ngo i think that's a lot of where the problems are in terms of the nonprofit industrial complex and so you know it's asking people to sacrifice in terms of um having like a a good salary but you know we more than make up for it in terms of purpose and and so i think the fact that we've got these such great applicants it really fills me with hope that there are people who are willing to devote their lives um,15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,15:47,to something bigger than themselves and yeah it's really exciting exciting times and absolutely especially when the future of human beings and indeed planet earth depends on it uh and you know planetary boundaries have been approached and and breached uh mercilessly and and we still you know don't have to see uh you know don't seem to have it all together and and you mentioned this word uh social movements uh you know and uh i know that we even titled this show as what's veganism gotta do with social movements you know there's enough that i need to do explaining around intersectional veganism and how it's not just about this but it's also about connecting the dots and therefore why we do this show um tell us a little bit about um what is a social movement you know give us a couple of examples of and and why you believe at animal think tank that veganism animal rights needs to be a social movement right well i mean i think there's so many different definitions of what,16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,16:49,social movement is but like an example that i think everybody can relate or most people can relate to is like black lives matter extinction rebellion um you know it's it's diverse individuals groups organizations working towards some kind of social change um and the way that we actually conceptualize it in animal think tank which i think is kind it's quite unique i think and i think it's one of our one of our sort of i guess um the way that we look at things quite broadly is that we look at um social movements and successful social movements as an ecology of of change and when you look at successful social movements like the civil rights movement or indian independence or so many of the changes that have happened in society have come about through um collective action mass protests people actually being disruptive and sacrificing for the cause but it's not just that peace um there's also lobbying and party politics there is individual change going vegan um you,17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,17:53,know leadership development you know all sorts of things and then there's also building alternatives alternatives alternative visions of the future so co-housing projects um veganic farming so all of these pieces are needed in a successful social movement ecology and what we found or what you know in the uk um when we started there really wasn't any organization that was doing sort of the mass protest civil disobedience the kind the really disruptive um type of action that is about shifting public opinion um and so that's kind of what we're focusing on um right now we're focusing on seeding a social movement organization for animal freedom um and we we a year and a half ago i think it was we seeded animal rebellion which um your viewers may or may not have heard of um as a kind of ally to extinction rebellion part of their movement of movements um to test out our theories and also because there was an opportunity i mean,18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,18:54,and it's a growing opportunity because the climate issue is so urgent and people are so like galvanized around it um and we saw an opportunity to actually bring the animal um agriculture and and fishing industry message and the plant-based food system message to the environmental movement um so now there is you know a civil disobedience type of organization in the uk ecology but we want to to seed one which is an anti-speciesist one um not necessarily only about the environment um yeah yeah you know that's really interesting with all these diverse examples that you gave um uh when i think uh you know having grown up in india and been exposed to the gandhian philosophy of how india achieved its independence um you mentioned civil disobedience and you know uh boycotting the industry and uh and and also doing it in a way which is through um you know civic and civil you know uh disobedience and and not necessarily uh,19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,19:56,i don't know waging war which seems to be the vocabulary of uh you know this military industrial complex that we're um we all tend to define and describe our progress and growth and which obviously is you know leading to uh planetary annihilation at this point so that needs massive change and and in my previous conversations with you you've mentioned this concept called theory of change and uh and i think that our viewers many of them who run non-profit organizations or for-profit vegan businesses and so on you know they're or they're just you know an activist and an advocate and they really want to do something about this and might want to think about it from an organizational standpoint so what what is animal think tank's theory of change and before you talk about that just give us a little bit of an education around what is theory of change well i mean i think theory of change i can explain it very very simply it really is what it sounds like it's what is our beliefs about how change is made,20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,21:02,um and and i you know i think i think the the term actually comes from the development sort of industry um and i have been and in many projects that i worked in i don't think that they actually had explicitly understood or or clarified what how is it that we believe that change is made it was just kind of like doing stuff you know um and similarly i think what i've you know in in the animal um freedom movement you know many organizations haven't actually clarified what it is or how it is that they think change is made um and so when we're talking about the sort of social movement ecology framework it is so useful um for understanding the different theories of change that are happening i mean so veganism there is an underlying assumption or theory of change that well individual change can lead to broader societal changes um the sort of mass protest um civil disobedience group you know their the theory of change is,21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,22:04,you know what power is held by the people we give it away to um you know our power holders we can reclaim that through not complying um and and and shift public opinion in the process and then like basically force politicians and powerholders to um to kind of follow our lead and actually make changes because they're being forced to through um you know increased public active and and sort of passive public opinion so there's lots of different theories of change and then of course there are there's a theory of change if you're looking at sort of um party politics and lobbying it's kind of like you know you're focusing on those on on the system and changing the system from the inside um and i used to think oh no we can't change things from the inside and oh we can't change things through individual change we we just need structural change actually all of it's needed and for a really i think successful movement and,22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,23:01,movement ecology um you need all of those pieces in place and there is a creative synergy that happens um when everybody's kind of doing their thing and understanding what each of the other groups are doing so there's not a like i'm right and you're wrong my way is better your way is not good it's understanding our place in the broader context and that is a really really important for us the animal think tank and different different roles and different theories of change come to prominence at different points in the movement cycle so often when you look at social justice movements that have been successful the sort of takeoff stage um that's where your rebels your direct action activists are you know pushing the issue out into the public consciousness and they're doing their thing and then once they've got the public's attention and maybe the power holders attention that's when the kind of reformers or the ngos or those who are used to interfacing with you know policy makers they come to the forefront to codify the changes that are being,23
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,24:03,pushed for by the rebels and so it's like we all we all have a role to play in this movement cycle um and also in the ecology and so that i think that's a broader that's our broader theory of change that we need all of those things to be to create transformative change yeah it's very interesting you know as you were talking about this i was thinking about the challenger brand theory i i don't know if you've heard about that um it's it's frequently used in um you know consumer marketing consumer advertising innovation practical innovation product innovation kind of a you know landscape and um adam morgan who's also based in the uk um was the author of the book called the pirate inside and and they talk about how uh you there's a necessary level of piracy you know that you need um while you're working inside the larger establishment of the navy for example and and where that necessary rebellion,24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,25:04,needs to be seated because if you don't then then the big established you know the power holders that you were mentioning can get away with a lot of things um you know which may not be for the good of uh the society or the world at large so he wrote the pirate inside uh there was another book called eating the big fish you know which is the whole narrative of david versus goliath and how do you really take on this goliath and and in the end they came up with the challenger brand um theory and and you can you can be a challenger brand as long as you're challenging a dominant mindset and and that there's a role for every organization um and different types of organizations to take the baton you know so to speak from another in that life cycle of change that that you're talking about so it's very interesting that there's uh you know i've been exposed to that uh in in the corporate world and i just so wish that we used this and all of those ideas that are already you know with us uh for true,25
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,26:08,purpose that not just for the purpose of profit you know personal or financial so um so okay so to have the theory of change in place you know the animal uh think tank is working on it you've also um in in our conversations really emphasize the the importance of organization building talk to me a little bit about that oh my goodness i could talk about this all day um this is this is what we have been focusing on animal think tank for the last um i guess year and a half now and it's kind of you know before i got involved with animal think tank i wouldn't have known why it's important i mean maybe i would have intellectually known why it's important but you know governance and processes and systems that sounds really boring um and yet it is absolutely fundamental um to actually having organizations that last to having cultures where and creating conditions where people can thrive and bring their best selves,26
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,27:13,um having clarity around who makes decisions where authority lies um it's something that i think that you know many of us are not skilled in necessarily we've had to do a lot of learning and and there's loads there's so much literature though out there that's that's really good and really really helpful um but you know i think a lot of us have come from activist backgrounds we have like a group of friends um that we go and do actions with and it's kind of like well you know we can figure stuff out we don't need to write down the rules or any of those sorts of things and i think you know our experience is that um you know we started off as a group of um you know friends i suppose um and we brought we brought um people on i wanted to grow uh and we were all you know friendly and we're all good people and you know we should be able to work stuff out and i think you know one of our issues is that we probably grew quicker and we got more complex,27
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,28:10,than our processes and systems would allow and we didn't have any um and you know people have different levels of tolerance to uncertainty and not quite knowing what's going on and things so um i think what i found is is is like building those foundations of systems process and when i talk about systems i mean i can talk about very concretely what we've done um you know we have we have now developed a system for decision making for conflict transformation for resource allocation for care connection and support um and for information flow um and for feedback um and to make those things explicit and transparent so everybody kind of knows what's going on also making our roles really explicit and our accountabilities um you know those are kind i suppose those are kind of like the hard systems but also like our identity who are we what do we value um and so we've you know we've spent a long a lot of time actually articulating what are our core values and what are the values that we need in order to actually achieve our,28
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,29:13,mission actually even getting a mission statement what are we doing why are we doing it how are we going to do it you know that's that's you know the mission statement doesn't seem very long but there's a lot of thinking and a lot of discussions and a lot of process that went on behind the scenes and all of that is so important to get everybody on the same page and to make sure that we have a co-created and shared vision and everybody's kind of like you know moving in the same direction um and then culturally i think um you know so much of organization building is around culture and you know that's my that's my area and i think we focus a lot on the doing and the like the work and um but i think i can't i think i realized quite a while ago that it doesn't matter if we've got like 20 really really smart people in the room if they don't feel psychologically safe if they don't trust each other if um if you know,29
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,30:11,we can't bring our best selves we can't bring our creative ideas we can't take risks because of fear of criticism judgment um etc so um you know and there's there's such a paradigm shift i think that well you know we're trying to i guess pre-figure the society that we want to see and actually incorporate that into our practices you know as far as i'm concerned the means um are the ends so we also have to like you know act and behave and um you know function in ways that that are actually probably contradictory to a lot of the the values and the ways of behaving in sort of more conventional hierarchical and profit driven corporations let's say and so there's a lot of unlearning that we've had to do um you know just very simply like thinking about how we deal with conflict and how we're so sort of conditioned to think in terms of right and wrong and good and bad and a sort of punitive mindset around around conflict and tensions and shifting that to a more restorative or transformative approach to conflict it's,30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,31:11,just like one example our approach to power um you know in in a lot of activist spaces um you know we don't have any leaders and we're all equal um and so any kind of i guess somebody stepping into leadership over and above a certain point is kind of like you know dragged down a little bit and actually if we want to be powerful and win we need everyone to step into their full power we're not all equal we have equal value but we have different things to bring um and so i think unlearning and re-learning a different way of approaching all of these things it might not feel might not have seemed important to me a few years ago but through experience i think these are the things that we've been working on and yeah i feel like i really feel like we've we've spent a lot of time um building sort of strong foundations to now be able to grow i think faster um as a result of um and the final thing i'll say is is so much of it depends on,31
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,32:10,having like the right people and i don't mean the right there's right people and wrong people but people who fit with your vision and your values and i think when we started a year and a half ago when we were bringing people on i don't think we could properly articulate who we were and what we wanted and what we needed um and so maybe we made decisions based on who we connected with or who you know you know plus skills and and and all of that but now i think we've got a much better idea of who we are and so we can attract people who are who are attracted to the thing you know who we are um and having the right people um makes life a lot easier um yeah yeah absolutely you know um well i i do have a corporate for-profit kind of a background and for many many years longer than i have been part of the non-profit uh kind of you know side of things and and i do agree you know a lot of activists bring a lot of passion and they'll bring their wounds to the movement and and there's a lot of that,32
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,33:14,and uh and sometimes you know uh what's missing is um the rule book like how are you going to do this you know it's great you've got a lot of passion you've got a lot of ideas but how are we channeling that energy into something that it becomes executable becomes implementable and and then uh you know has uh the power of that unified vision behind it and and as you were talking i was thinking about it's so important for the movement to organize because who we're up against are hyper-organized yeah they are a very well oiled machinery with with um you know with the rule book written i don't know 100 years ago as to how do you do innovation how do you bring ideas to the fore how are those debated when do you do conversations of possibility then you move on to conversations of feasibility and then you get into gatekeeping and who's going to get keep that and and the ideas and theories of leadership also uh come up,33
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,34:17,you know in terms of are you going to make it more sociocratic are you going to make it more military command and control and and uh uh there's a lot of for-profit uh you know in the there's a lot of change that is going on right now in the for-profit world as well you know when you look at the country of singapore they've created a hub which uh actually focuses on sociocracy you know more than on uh this traditional conventional idea of you know creating hierarchy so there are many models out there and and it sounds like that at animal think tank you're really really you've taken the time um to absorb the learnings you've had you've um invested the effort to codify vision who we are what are we doing written out a mission statement that everyone can be behind and and not just be you know fueled with passion alone but actually bring both passion and professionalism together all right so um you've spoken about theory of change you've spoken about organization building um what other you know projects,34
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,35:24,are you involved at at um animal think tank like what's next you you want to tell us a little bit more about that okay so i think um what what are we working on right now other than organization building well we are um focusing on developing um our meta narrative and our story-based strategy and that is um a really i think it's a really key part of our offering hopefully to the movement um you know we want to be strategic and the idea is that we you know um we have some kind of a grand objective and then can can identify key strategic milestones in order to be able to achieve that objective but i think that the and that's quite that's quite conventional um you know sort of basic strategy but um there is this aspect of actually being guided by a narrative that can actually speak to people's existing values rather than trying to superimpose a new set of values onto society,35
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,36:28,and the best way that i could sort of explain why or how this is important is the freedom to marry movement so the kind of you know the lgbt movement in the u.s was not having a huge amount of success with the kind of rights based narrative because um it wasn't resonating with half the population but when they changed their narrative to you know freedom to love to commit to um you know to fat to have a family um i think within like 10 years or 11 years they were able to um to succeed in terms of the right to marry and i think um so we are trying to come up with our what so what is what is the story that's going to reach people um currently when it comes to animal freedom and you know the go vegan message is not going it's not we don't think it's the ideal message um because it actually you know going against through um liberal and sort of individualistic um values of like the freedom of choice,36
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,37:34,basically um so we often joke that we're going to end up with it with a narrative of like you know animal lovers or something like that but that's kind of that's kind of um yeah and and i say this there's a lot of we're doing well we want to do quite a bit of research around how people actually talk in different demographics different sectors of society talk about animals currently um and uh you know one of the roles we're advertising for is a corpus linguist who can actually do that research work so um i think that's quite an exciting um project that we're on so it's the story based strategy and that's also we want to develop that in in relationship and in collaboration with other other organizations within the movement because there's no point in us coming up with like what we think is a great narrative and nobody else you know is sort of buying buying into it so it's kind of like what is our equivalent of black lives matter for the animal movement that we can kind of as as a wider movement um sort of get,37

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,39:37,looking at narratives um no and and i think also i just want to caveat this this is not my area uh we have a brilliant and very talented narrative lead who's looking after all of this so um take everything i say with the pinch of salt um don't quote me um but no i think the idea is to have a meta narrative but then to have stories some like stories with that align with that meta narrative that can speak to different sectors of society different types of of people so i think yeah it's not like a it's just going to be one thing and that's it no and i think there has to be continuous production of these stories but uh as time goes on and as conditions change and as things happen um but still within that kind of framing that very broad framing of a meta narrative right and as you develop it you also mentioned that um it can't be developed or implemented in isolation that you would be looking towards you know other players what is your vision,39
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,40:38,of um what are those types of organizations or groups that uh that might um you know help you in in bringing this to life yeah so we've um we we are working with an organization called perk that specializes in um help like developing narratives for different types of movements um and their methodology includes having what they call hack days or stakeholder days so we're actually um planning one for before the end of the year to bring various organizations together so that's in progress and it would be you know i guess key influencer type organizations within the animal movement in the uk we're very uk focused at the moment with the aspiration that if we are successful um it will inspire you know international kind of um organizations to be set up and movements and such so um it's very much a work in progress i can't give you uh uh great details on who would be involved but it would be um influential,40
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,41:39,organizations or different parts of the ecology as well um in the movement so i guess representatives of those who would come to those stakeholder days and input and share their ideas and also hopefully yeah buy into the approach um yeah okay great um we'll keep an eye out and watch for you know the space around animal think tank to know more about uh how you're bringing that meta narrative to um reality um you were talking about other projects before i really yes thank you um so okay um what else i'm thinking about um okay there's there's something that around the organization building um you know we've learned so much and we are currently um creating an att handbook which um has is going to have all of our systems and our processes and our policies and how we're doing things all in one place and it'll be open source um and we're we're currently thinking about it's not been decided but doing,41
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,42:42,like a kind of 10-day international training based on our experience this isn't the right way it's our way that we found that has worked um but we sort of feel like that would be something that would be a something that would be a nice contribution to other organizations that maybe you know don't quite understand or know how to go about building foundations and kind of they don't have to go through the two or three years of learning that we've had to go through including the tensions and the conflicts and all the fallout and all the rest of it so that's one thing that's kind of we're thinking about an international training um and then the the the roles that we're recruiting for currently social movement culture lead political strategy um you know that's all around okay so what is the dna and the foundations of this social movement organization that we're going to seed and so we're kind of shifting gears from creating a strong foundation of animal think tank to okay so we've now created an organization that concede a social movement organization like,42
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,43:43,extinction rebellion like animal rebellion like black lives matter um and so i think we're really shifting gears into what what is the dna what are the foundations of the movement and so for example from a cultural perspective that is like how do we how what kind of conflict transformation system would local group groups need what kind what are the principles and values of the wider movement you know it it might be based on what we've developed to att but it has to be relevant to a sort of movement level um and yeah i think if if we go by our sort of project plan um which it probably won't happen this way but if all goes to plan by next year in a year's time we would have developed those and we would have started seeding local groups in the uk um and the idea would be to do mass trainings to train like maybe a five-day kind of training for organizers and groups to set up um and you know hand over the resources and also support and coach and what have you,43
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,44:45,groups all over the country who can then have the capacity to create you know their own local campaigns but then also come together for strategic sort of national campaigns that we would um that we would call help to coordinate and so that's kind of like what we're aiming for um maybe in a year or year and a half time um yeah i think there's the thing i haven't missed anything oh you're always working on so many amazing things and and i'm just so excited you know for all the stuff that you've shared and uh what's in store for the world to see once animal think tank is ready to you know share um whether it's the influential you know animal rights organizations in the uk that you're going to make a call to or it's that this international training now tell me who would be the ideal recipient of this training oh the animal rights organizations or think i mean i think i don't know because we haven't thought about it too deeply but i think um,44
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,45:41,you know can i raise my hand i would love to be yeah totally absolutely no i you know i in my mind it's those kind of smaller organizations that have great potential because they've got loads of passion and but they don't quite know necessarily how to grow um how to um yeah you know it's you know if i was doing this on my own it would be so difficult like to know how to go about building my team developing systems etcetera so i think it's the sort of the smaller organizations but at the same time um you know if people from you know larger sort of grassroots organizations like save or dxc or whoever like i think it's it's really a call for anybody who actually sees the importance of having like building the foundations of organizations that can last basically rather than just sort of you know if you've got an ambition to last a long time and last the long haul so that we can actually you know to the point where we can win then i think um,45
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,46:47,it would be very relevant to it to all types of organizations within the animal movement space right right one of our broadcasters and broadcast partners is plant peer communities you know and i'm on the pod advisory council with them and i know uh many people in the audience are pod leaders and these are you know small pods they want to do community work they do a lot of community engaged lifestyle medicine work uh sometimes uh they're either either physician-led or activist-led or just you know somebody who has a powerful uh transformation story of their own and they feel uh you know motivated to start a neighborhood thing and then before they know it you know they're inviting other people and other strangers into their home and teaching them how to cook and you know sharing principles of veganism and uh and the ethical aspects of it and so on so um so this is this is exciting news that you know people who are wanting to scale up people who uh believe that now they're not just one but two but three and four and and don't really know the path uh,46
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,47:49,this is an excellent opportunity so we'll definitely keep an eye out for that from animal think tank um let's shift gears a little bit you know let's go back to your um your personal growth and and you know so my specific question is is more like a leadership question to you um how has your own personal journey led you to step into your power laila oh gosh well i haven't fully stepped into my power i don't think it's like total work in progress um i think um you know i think when i think to kind of like the foundations or the roots of where i am now like my parents played a really really big role i have the privilege of coming from a family um that's really loving but was also um really focused on on service on giving generously of time and and knowledge and those sorts of things so i think i've grown up you know seeing my parents um doing that and and and and and yeah,47
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,48:53,giving um and making change in the world um and i think you know my parents have always you know instilled in all of us that we can do whatever we put our minds to there's no limitation um i mean there's the limitations that i put on myself or the false beliefs and narratives and all the rest of it um and i think um at the moment is is a process of trying to unlearn some of those things um but i think i never really saw myself as the leader in invest commerce um and i think it's really you know i was an expert in my field um you know and i had a you know successful career and but it was still very much like focused on my expertise and not necessarily like holding space for others or developing teams or those sorts of things i think animal think tank has really sort of pushed me into um i feel like i'm being called into something and i think the fears and limitations that i might put on myself are kind of put into huge perspective by,48
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,49:54,the by the cause that i'm working for because all of my fears and all of the rest of it kind of pale into comparison when i think about um the animals um and i think a really another sort of important aspect that i kind of i guess i'm really lucky to have a partner who is pretty fearless and thinks that he can do anything doesn't care what anybody else thinks and he's gone on his own leadership journey and he's you know set up a big animal hospital having no you know formal training in business you know he's an emergency and critical care vet and it's grown from like 65 people to 190 people in the last two years so i have been like walking that journey with him and just seen you know i've learned so much by his way of being and he's like he has so much more faith in me than i do in myself and so that kind of makes me want to step um step into that um so yeah i think,49
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,50:50,i'm realizing that if i'm if if we're gonna if we're gonna win if we're gonna make the changes in the world that we think are needed then we have to step into our into the fullness of who we are and i think um as women um i think there's been all sorts of stories that have been told about how we should be and probably um how we think we should be that we have to unlearn and i'm in the process of doing that and and i sort of feel like um as i as as i continue down this path i'm becoming i care less what other people think um i'm happy to like you know i sort of feel like what i'm what i'm bringing is enough it doesn't have to be perfect the imposter syndrome sort of voice is getting you know quieter and quieter as i realize that that is just you know the patriarchy um and i just sort of i'm really motivated by the fact that um without wanting to be and realizing that,50
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,51:50,i am that i am i think a role model for younger women in our organization and the people that we work with so i have to be unapologetically myself and give and that gives permission for others to be unapologetically themselves and bring their full selves so that's what i am kind of working on at the moment and yeah it's great yeah it this is awesome you know you you mentioned um how you you're stepping into your own right and you're you're embracing your own self and that is critical because if we don't then who will and when others um who look up to us you know in our organizations or even outside of the organization they've got to see us role modeling that unapologetic embracing of oneself yeah the other thing you mentioned was it's critical for women to support other women because there's enough you know with the patriarchy trying to pull us down anyway right so,51
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,52:50,women supporting other women is critically important for the animal rights movement and the vegan movement intersectional vegan movement plant-based movement um i totally agree with you cannot emphasize this um you know any anymore because well when you look at the u.s 79 of the animal rights activists here are women so it is a women-led movement and we are the face of it um and and our voices deserve to be united um you know versus conflict and you know dragging somebody down and all of that which are human tendencies but i guess the you know the movement calls for us to rise above that layla you you want to say something else we are running out of time but okay okay we'll let you have the last word tell us i what was coming up for me then is that you know the way that i used to think of leadership i think is a very masculine model of leadership of individual kind,52
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdZKAWWRHWA,What's Veganism got to do with Social Movements?,Animal Think Tank,22 Sept 2021,53:49,of hero savior um competition over collaboration etc and what i'm learning is a sort of more feminine way of leadership it's relational it's collaboration it's not just using logic and rationality there's a place for emotions and intuition and i really i if we want to win if we want to build a powerful movement we all have to be powerful individuals and that looks different for everybody and i kind of feel like we have to embody that if we want others to also embody that and have a leader full movement yes exactly and and um yeah and coming into our divine feminine you know and and embracing femininity and coming up with female um leadership models which can look very differently depending on you know the person because we've got to allow for personality and so on but still find a way to make it collaborative versus the alpha male competitive i'm top of the herd uh you,53

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMohXFAS8Os,Are You Plugged Into The Matrix?,Generation Vegan,22 Sept 2020,0:17,and it needs to make sure he continues eating these foods it distorts his perceptions of reality so he doesn't see a dead dog or secretions from horses or canaries he just sees food this is the matrix of carnism carnism is the invisible belief system that conditions us to eat certain animals and to never question why we eat some,2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMohXFAS8Os,Are You Plugged Into The Matrix?,Generation Vegan,22 Sept 2020,0:39,animals but not others carnism distorts our perceptions of those species we've learned to classify as edible so we see them as food and act accordingly carnism is why conscientious people end up supporting an industry that unnecessarily kills more animals in one week than the total number of people killed in all wars,3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMohXFAS8Os,Are You Plugged Into The Matrix?,Generation Vegan,22 Sept 2020,1:00,throughout history and which is one of the largest contributors to climate change the matrix causes this man to be a passive consumer rather than an active citizen most people would recognize carnism as the global atrocity it is if they caught on to the fact that they're plugged into the,4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMohXFAS8Os,Are You Plugged Into The Matrix?,Generation Vegan,22 Sept 2020,1:17,carnistic matrix they'd be its challengers rather than its supporters so carnism teaches us to believe in myths like the three ends of justification eating certain animals is normal natural and necessary or that farmed animals aren't individuals with personalities,5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMohXFAS8Os,Are You Plugged Into The Matrix?,Generation Vegan,22 Sept 2020,1:35,so for example we learn to believe that a pig is a pig and all pigs are the same and carnism makes us feel defensive against anyone or anything that helps us catch on to the fact that we're in the carnistic matrix ever notice how you feel when you meet a vegan the good news is that once we catch on to carnism,6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMohXFAS8Os,Are You Plugged Into The Matrix?,Generation Vegan,22 Sept 2020,1:54,everything changes it's not that we see different things we see the same things differently that's awareness and the carnistic matrix is but one of many matrices were plugged into and although each matrix distorts our perceptions of a different kind of individual or group they all affect us in the very same way,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMohXFAS8Os,Are You Plugged Into The Matrix?,Generation Vegan,22 Sept 2020,2:17,so once you understand how one matrix works you understand how they all work with awareness you can choose what role you play in a system you can become an ally what this means is that you don't have to be fully vegan to be a part of the solution and help transform carnism you can be a vegan ally a supporter of veganism and vegans,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMohXFAS8Os,Are You Plugged Into The Matrix?,Generation Vegan,22 Sept 2020,2:40,just try to be as vegan as possible and use your influence to help others catch on to carnism you,9

to shut down to do these things to these sentient beings. You know, you see them respond. They have pain. They have suffering. Sally came to us early 
one morning from another rescue group who called on us for assistance. It was really heart-wrenching when we first saw her in the back of the volunteers' car, when they lifted up the boot,",1

head a little, and that was all enough to move our hearts, and our minds, and our bodies into action to, to try and save this, this animal before us. And just from day one, we were struck by Sally's resilience. You know, she had every reason to give up living, but she still kept on hanging on to the possibility",2

on her feet. Kwok and I worked around 
the clock with her teaching her to basically walk again. There was lots of rehabilitations in slings and therapy, vitamin nutrition, intravenous drips, antibiotics for infections, and all those things. And she was just the most incredible animal that chose to work with the 
very being",3

You know, we've cast these animals as, as farm animals, as, as production units saying, when you manage them in the huge numbers that these animals are, are raised in it's hard to give them the individual care that they need.

stay positive. That's what she needed was 
our positivity, not our negativity. So everything that we took from there on was actually Sally gonna live. Each day we were more and 
more positive that we're actually gonna, gonna get there. And to actually see her walking around on her own steam, it was just the greatest thing. Ya know, there were smiles

And essentially, that's obese. My doctor visits, every visit that I would go, is a typical, ""You need to lose your weight."" They wouldn't tell me how.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,2:16,has many unique qualities for one we're an ally Movement we still have so much to learn from other social justice movements so in this webinar I want to share three key ingredients for Success that we at animal Think Tank feel are essential to building an effective and Powerful movement and which we're applying in our own work um and before I get into these ingredients I really feel to say that I realize the title for this webinar you know how we win animal freedom is pretty obnoxious um the ingredients that I want to share are important for sure but fundamentally nobody really knows how we will win animal freedom but in any case um I'm imagining it helped to get some of you here so I'm not that sorry um so the insights that I want to share are drawn from a variety of resources on social movement Theory and best practice um which have been very influential to us and I would highly recommend reading some of these on the screen um and our experience is also really informed by learning from and at times organizing with the movements that have been,3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,3:16,happening in the UK over the past few years including Extinction rebellion and black lives matter which have been yeah really able to shift the national conversation right in front of our eyes so what are the these three ingredients well firstly a healthy social movement ecosystem uh secondly shared transformational goals and thirdly Grassroots people power and in one way or another all of these ingredients rely on working together for change so uh I want to ask you what do you think of when I say the word ecosystem and you can just po post um in the chat any words that come to mind and then Nat if you can shout out not shout just say some of the words that you see so you've got community diverse interconnection many elements that work together less fragmented mutualism interdependent relationship supportive symbiosis we've had that a couple of times knowledge sharing cooperation,4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,4:30,oh beautiful thank you these are all brilliant words so diverse interconnected collaboration um I can't remember if you um said Synergy or if anybody has said Synergy but that's an important one for me um and so you know bearing these words in mind successful social movements throughout history have included you know groups with different approaches to social change so diverse groups working in Synergy with one another and because of this uh social movements are often thought of as ecologies or as ecosystems and within any social movement ecosystem there are usually three foundational theories of change personal transformation building Alternatives and changing the dominant institutions that shape society and changing institutions can be done through the inside game or the outside game so if we're talking about personal transformation this is about changing lives one person at a time so for example um through reaching higher levels of awareness through diversity training or meditation or providing a service like a food bank so it's about Ono one uh relationships and,5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,5:37,and change um and it's really about sort of you know that famous saying of being the change that we want to see in the world creating Alternatives is about new ways of doing and being in the world so we're talking about things like cooperatives intentional communities alternative media um restorative justice programs and the idea is that successful experiments can lead to larger change through scaling up and the subcultures that are formed in this kind of alternative space is also you know really important because it's where many of those in the outside game which I'm going to come to um you know they come from often they come from these alternative subcultures now changing the dominant institutions that s shape Society is fundamentally about structural change and this means leveraging power to influence or remove the institutions that shape our lives like governments and corporations um and the idea is that structural change can improve the lives of many more efficiently than individual change and we can do this um through,6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,6:42,playing the inside game and I realize people mean different things when they say the inside game um and so in this framework the inside game means using established channels to create change so we're talking about strategic litigation we're talking about lobbying governments or corporations and we're Al talking about Party politics uh and we could change institutions also through playing the outside game which has two strands so the first strand is something called structure-based organizing or Community organizing and this is about building bases of leaders and organizations to pressure power holders in dominant institutions to create change and the classic example of this is trade unions um but also community-based campaigning groups and then the other way to to play the outside game is through Mass protest which is focused on shifting public opinion and um what's called changing the political weather to put pressure on the system from the outside and fundamentally to shift the Overton window making things that were previously Unthinkable uh possible or,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,7:48,even ideally probable now another way to look at the ecosystem is through the lens of the movement cycle so social movement theorist Bill Moyer found that successful social movements have four roles of activism played by individuals and organizations and each one comes to the four at different stages of social movements so for example the rebels those following the mass protest outside game approach come to the for at the movement takeoff stage often after something called a trigger event which I'll talk about um in a while and then the reformers so the professional NOS who play the inside game and who work to convert The Winds of the rebels into new laws they often come to the for in later stages of the movement cycle and if we map this back onto our ecosystem framework um the stages look a bit like this so starting off with you know individual change and building Alternatives and then that's the foundation on which we um do some Comm do community organizing and that primes,8

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,10:00,corporations using inside game approaches but then they can also mobilize and coordinate members to sign petitions to post on social media to write letters to MPS to physically protest outside targets and generally like pressure corporations and government in a coordinated way from the outside um we have you know very few playing the outside game though we've got a few now doing structure or community- based organizing so in the UK well I think it's now going Global but um we've got the plant-based unies Campaign which is a great structure-based campaign that is having you know amazing success in the UK um and then we've also got plant-based treaty which is excellent which is also having great success but there's there's not many of these types of organizations um and then there's even fewer I would say in the mass protest space in the UK we've got animal Rising um which is the main one and I guess um direct action everywhere in the US but I'm not aware of that many other um groups uh and organizations doing math protest on a on a relatively large scale,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,11:04,so I'm curious um now that I've shared these broad categories and you know just to say there's overlap between them it's obviously not as simple as this or as straightforward and like I said many organizations are engaged in more than one strategy um but I'm wondering um how many of you are working primarily with personal transformation maybe you can type into the chat um if you are and like what kind of things that you're doing Maybe Natalie can um share um we've got Dharma practice someone working on cultural change oh brilliant Outreach with um we the free and AV um personal transformation Anonymous for The Voice yes brilliant thank you um and how many of you or who of you are working on building Alternatives and what kind of things are you doing not seeing anything yet for Alternatives oh no Alternatives here on this webinar surely there must be,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,12:38,one no oh one health health coach so helping clients go plant-based contemplative vegan initiatives and investing in plant-based business yes start YouTube channel sustainable nutrition getting V food and colleges brilliant thank you and what about the inside game how many of you are lobbying uh governments and doing corporate campaigns um using inside game game strategies and so we've got someone who's inside and outside game structural change at the Humane League and also volunteers with NC Animal Advocates United um animal fairness Alliance animal equality Mercy For Animals does a lot of this thanks brilliant and how about um outside game strategies anybody working on the sort of community organizing or mass protest,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,13:47,piece I'm still got lots rolling in for um we've got yeah organizing Mass protests with um national animal rights March oh yes brilliant Community organizing animal [Music] Rising um protesting soci shells an animal farm um p- based treaty um Mercy For Animals does this well in Brazil we've got a student anti-species Network brilliant best around the world great so there's loads of different strategies right here um on this webinar um that's really great to know uh let me just okay so um all of these approaches are needed and I think if if you remember one thing from this webinar I think this is the thing that I would love you to go away with it's that all of these different types of approaches are needed for a healthy movement ecosystem and at the same time each one of these theories of change have,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,14:54,strengths and weaknesses and I won't go through these in detail because of time but for example just to give you a flavor a strength of the inside game is that it has access to power holders um but a weakness is that it can be limited by the dominant rules and it can be too focused on being uh realistic and promoting only minor reforms uh and it can also be prone to cooptation so for example inside game NGO staff may identify more with official power holders than with the movements Grassroots and you know my previous life and career was in International Development and I spent um you know I've worked and a lot of ngos in the development sector and I would say cooptation and the sort of nonprofit industrial complex um is a real uh risk in development but also in all sorts of movements um so I think this is an important one um so Mass protest the strength of mass protest is that it can really put the issue in the in the public Spotlight and it can create conditions for far-reaching Transformations and really open up lots of opportunities for the rest of the ecology a weakness is that it's hard to,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,15:58,sustain the energy and it's also hard to translate into concrete victories and that's something that the inside game is good at doing so all of these theories of change have their strengths and weaknesses where one theory of change strengths can make up for another another's weakness um and all of these can be done effectively or ineffectively but fundamentally as I said we need all of these in a healthy movement ecology um and not understanding our own and our and each other's theories of change um I think is one of the main causes of infighting in movements and fundamentally this diminishes our Collective power aside from the breadth and depth um in the movement ecosystem which is fundamentally what I've been talking about um researchers also found that cultivating interconnection is one of the most important Investments That a movement can make so the most effective movements have active cultivators doing this work through bringing organizations together bridging gaps developing trust,15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,16:58,and sharing learnings Okay so we've talked about the importance of a healthy movement ecosystem for social change now I'd like to talk briefly about the importance of having a shared strategy and narrative um and previous social um movements successful social movements have had high level goals and Milestones which then guided um organizations to focus on a particular area or issue for a period of time and they created unity and momentum around certain goals which were key to their success and some theorists talk about something called a grand strategy which is sometimes shown as this very Advanced uh strategic tool that we use a triangle with a long-term goal at the top called the Grand objective and then the next level down with phases or Milestones needed to achieve the grand objective and then each Milestone or phase would have Associated campaigns and tactics so for example the Civil Rights movement's goal was equality for African-Americans and they focused on a few well and I would say that that's that goal has still not been met and they focused on a,16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,18:02,few key issues of desegregation and voting rights with a diversity of campaigns and actions within each issue um and the freedom to marry campaign if you've been on any of our previous webinars you'll know that ATT really likes this campaign is and really uh finds it very inspiring for many reasons um and it's another example of a milestone along the way to equality for again lesbian people under the law and for a period of time this issue was the central focus of the movement and almost the face of it and and they won um but a couple of things I want to say when we talk about or when I talk about Unity um you know I'm not talking about you know a bunch of organizations and groups coming together to sign some kind of memorandum of understanding to say yes we're going to focus on a particular goal for the next five years um something that Paul Engler who is one of the authors of this is an uprising says a lot is that Unity doesn't build momentum momentum builds Unity so you,17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,19:03,know and as I understand it that's what what happened with freedom to marry and many other movements so just to clarify you know Unity doesn't necessarily mean some formal collaboration it's kind of um you know having a high level goal but also groups creating momentum around it and then bringing other people along kind of organically um and secondly a grand strategy is not a blueprint it's more of a path that people can easily understand and get behind and then autonomously design actions and campaigns um to support now a grand strategy encompasses both uh transactional and transformational approaches so transactional approaches are focused on achieving tangible incremental realistic wins within the existing system so this is the kind of inside game approach and then transformational approaches aim to you know really alter the climate of public debate to make more far-reaching changes possible over time and again both of these approaches are important the problem comes when people focus only,18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,20:04,on transactional approaches and incremental reforms without understanding the role of mass movements in creating transformational possibilities and I would argue that this is happening in the animal movement with a really heavy focus on incremental campaigns like cage-free campaigning and lots of money is going to these types of campaigns and very little is going to mass protest groups and the Grassroots and an example of a transformational approach is the victory around same-sex marriage and you know it might not seem that radical now but at the time many people thought it was impossible to achieve and in this as an uprising they write rather than being based on calculating realism the drive for marriage equality Drew on a transformational vision it was grounded in the idea that if social movements could win the battle over public opinion the courts and the legislators would ultimately fall in line and just as movements um well we feel need to have shared goals they also need to have a shared narrative and this is where different groups align their,19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,21:08,messaging and storytelling around a shared campaign or Milestone stemming from a deeper unified narrative a unified narrative that speaks to Shared values and an inspiring vision which can really help to shift attitudes and World Views and influence cultural change at that you know much more deeper root level and again the LGB movement won gay marriage in the US through a narrative shift from gay rights to the freedom to love show commitment share family and marry so that values piece is really important and with this new narrative they built an 11-year campaign strategy and uh helped to unite a fragmented movement and they won Okay so we've talked about a healthy movement e ecosystem and shared transformational goals and narrative and the third ingredient that I want to talk about is Grassroots people power so historian and civil rights activist Howard Zin wrote the good things that have been done the wars that have been stopped the women's rights that have been won the racism that has,20

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,23:12,well tenth and Stevens analyzed over 300 National struggles against dictators globally over the last century and they found that no campaigns failed once they'd achieved the active and sustained participation of 3.5% of the population and lots of them succeeded with far less however to my knowledge um this 3.5% rule which has I think become quite famous since ex Extinction Rebellion um has at least in the UK a lot of people know what the 3.5% means um but it's never really played out in a western industrial democracy um and also it's important to say that these successful movements were never really aiming to achieve this threshold they were aiming to speak to a broad population of their country and mobilize them to act and seek change so achieve aing this participation of 3.5% or whatever it is of the population shouldn't be the goal but instead a side effect of successful organizing and social change and you know others say you know have different percentages um for example social network theorist Damon centa has found a,22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,24:14,25% Tipping Point in shifting Norms in social networks and chenor herself also suggests in other writing that social change might require a committed minority of 25% of the population regardless of the exact number movements need both active and passive support and as Bill Moyer wrote the central task of social movements is to win the hearts minds and support of the majority of the populace because is because it is the people who ultimately hold the power they will either preserve the status quo or create change but how do we get the 3.5% or the 25% or whatever it is the active support and the majority passive support for our court and what does social movement history tell us about how we can grow a mass movement well chenowth and Stevens found that nonviolent campaigns were twice as successful as violent campaigns and this is because a much larger amount of people felt safe to participate in,23
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,25:14,non-violent campaigns it's the idea of bringing the grandmas along violence fundamentally scares people off social movements also need to force the public to take notice of the issue and to take a stance and as Martin Luther King said non-violent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and Foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue it seeks to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored disruption is also key to Bringing attention to a cause um so and for example so many of the iconic civil rights campaigns were disruptive and also frowned upon at the time but were later found to be successful in bringing attention to the cause and this slide shows how the majority of the public were against the Freedom Riders and another famous campaign in the civil rights movement and yet it won people over to the cause and you know disruptive direct,24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,26:13,action I think is really misunderstood but it's been used in so many successful social justice movements for good reason it gets attention it dramatizes the Injustice it mobilizes people to action and ultimately it can help it really helps change public opinion um and again you know with everything it can be done effectively or ineffectively but the principle of disruption is really important and a great example of a disruptive action that ended up getting wall toall media coverage um in the UK last year was animal rising's disruption of the Grand National horse race um and it was the number one UK news story for a day and a half and Survey suggest there was a measurable Nationwide swing to the sentiment of I support a ban on horse racing and through this action and a summer of actions they were able to grow both their active and passive support and it had an impact um significant safety related rules for the Grand National were changed as a direct result of animal rising's actions and while you know I'm sure they would also,25
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,27:14,agree you know this is clearly not far enough you know we want a ban on horse racing and all animal exploitation I think this really does show the potential of these types of actions to have significant impact um okay uh another really important concept that helps us to choose campaign demands that can actually mobilize people is the concept of a symbolic demand symbolic demands are demands which are broadly and deeply felt and they are designed to polarize the public and push people towards your cause and you know polarizing means casting an issue in terms of right or wrong forcing people to pick a side and the classic example of a symbolic demand is the Salt March 1930 from the Indian independence struggle you know Gandhi didn't frame the protest March around kicking the British out of India he framed it around attacking the British Monopoly on salt which touched almost everyone and really symbolized the Injustice of British rule it was totally symbolic but because it was deeply felt and broadly felt it was,26
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,28:18,able to build a mass movement the Nashville Lunch Counter sittings is another example you know segregated lunch counters were symbolic of the injust ice and indignity of segregation and something that was deeply felt by the black population you know something that they faced and were humiliated by every day and the stins asked people to pick aside and here's a great quote from Diane Nash one of the um leaders of that movement uh showing the two sides that the Nashville campaign presented it was basically kill us or desegregate which wasn't much of a choice really and that's that's the point so throughout history um high-profile trigger events have also been catalysts for change um and you might remember with the movement cycle the takeoff stage of of of the movement cycle there's a trigger event that happens um so a trigger event is something like for example the arrest of Rosa Parks for refusing to move to the back of a bus Which prompted the Montgomery Bus Boycott more recently the murder of George Floyd in the US which,27
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,29:21,catalyzed you know the latest cycle of BLM protests unsuccessful movements have the ability to create trigger events and also harness external trigger events to reshape the debate but this doesn't happen by chance movements and our movement needs to build the capacity to be able to respond quickly and take hold of the narrative and to really mobilize around these these events and I think these events are happening all the time um often Mass protest movements come up really quickly and then they disappear just as quickly um if they don't have strong organizational structures in place to absorb the momentum and the energy that they've created and this growth is what we need to build power um now I realize I've uh said a lot and packed a lot in but fundamentally you know the whole process of growing the movement can be summarized by something called the cycle of momentum or momentum-driven organizing um which is explored and discussed um and put forward in this is,28
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,30:22,an uprising a book that I've mentioned multiple times in this talk so far and it's one of you know at's foundational texts um so the idea is first we escalate using non-violent direct action we then absorb the momentum that this creates into a decentralized structure and then this helps us to increase active popular support and then the cycle starts over again so that's um the cycle to help grow the movement and something else I I really wanted to highlight um in terms of building Grassroots people power if we want to mobilize a significant percentage of the population we need to prioritize volunteer driven efforts over relying on a small group of paid staff and NOS we don't have the money to pay millions of people and the most valuable resource that we have is people and their time and their energy and their passion and their creativity and you know I'm not saying we don't need NGS we need all of it but we need much more of the social movement volunteer driven Grassroots people power piece um and the nonprofit,29
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,31:27,Industrial complex in so many movements has systematically directed funding away from radical Grassroots movements towards more moderate nonprofit organizations depoliticizing and demobilizing social movements so we really need to make sure that we keep our radicalism okay just to recap then um we need to according to me and build a broad deep and interconnected movement ecosystem build unity and momentum around shared transformational goals and narrative unity and build Grassroots people power through mobilizing the mainstream and momentum driven organizing so how is animal Think Tank applying these lessons well firstly we are taking an ecosystem lens and working to help further fill out the UK ecosystem with Community organizing and mass mobilizing um and given that the movement cycle needs a foundation of community organizing to prime the pump,30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,32:28,of mass protest um our aim is to build a network of local community-based campaigning groups across the UK which has the Strate you know each group has the Strategic capacity to run their own campaigns and also come together for National coordinated campaigns you know aligned with our broader strategy and our narrative um and last year we ran a bunch of local Pilots to develop our capacity to do this kind of community organizing and for the moment we're focusing on other work that I'll talk about but we will be back to the community organizing again soon yeah one of our main streams of work is developing our ground strategy and we have spent the last year surfacing ideas through Consulting both the me eating public through focus groups to identify opportunities to leverage and move public opinion um we've also done so many interviews with movement stakeholders across the UK ecology to identify strategic opportunities and we have learned so much from all of you that we've interviewed um we've also gathered ideas,31
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,33:32,from Grassroots activists through larger workshops and we've also been doing a lot of desk Research into various aspects that we've been surfacing through these consultations that we'll be publishing over the coming months um and I don't expect you to even be able to read this slide but here are some of the initial themes or strategic Pathways that have emerged from our consultations and for each pathway we've identified insights and strategic opportuni and risks and are now in the process of developing um strategy maps for each of these Pathways and I won't spend much time on this as I'm pretty sure we'll be devoting a whole webinar or maybe more to this um not too soon into the future but just some of the pathways we're looking at include political representation for animals so we're talking about things like a commissioner for animal protection similar to the Future Generations commissioner in Wales you know animals are not represented in politics and for some political theorists this is is the prerequisite to actually getting rights for other animals rather than something that comes,32
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,34:32,afterwards um the animal rights pathway you know winning fundamental rights for animals like the right to life bodily Integrity Freedom you know we're exploring Pathways that evolve beyond the tra traditional like property personhood or welfare rights divide drawing on more recent legal Theory and scholarship which has been new for me and I find really exciting to see what might have emerged from that so yeah there's there's so many insights into each of these these Pathways um and also to say that all of these pathways are connected and many of the opportunities that we're surfacing in one pathway um can help other Pathways move forward so it's really not linear at all and I think the key for us is to find those nodes that we can leverage and move multiple Pathways forward um but I'll be talking more about this at the vegan and animal rights conference in Manchester next month so those of you who are uk- based and if you haven't bought your ticket already you really should because it's going to be great um yeah but more on all of this strategy work coming soon from us um and then the other way that,33
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,35:36,we're applying this um what I've talked about this ingredient these ingredients is our narrative work um you know the current dominant Narrative of go vegan is at odds with society's values of liberalism and individualism which both Center freedom of choice and so we're trying to uncover the most persuasive narratives and messages that can reach people's hearts and shift World Views through research and public testing and these are um three narratives that we found so far that really increase people's pro-animal sentiment significantly I'm not going to say much more about this because you can find out so much on our um animal Think Tank Youtube because so many of our webinars webinars to date have been like uh have been developing and exploring different aspects of narrative um but just so that you know we've got lots more research in the pipeline so if you haven't already please do sign up for our narrative newsletter and you know this this narrative research that we're doing is relevant to everybody in the ecology whichever role that you're playing um and it's all explored more in detail in our messaging guide which you can find on our,34
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,36:39,website um and yeah we're collaborating with stakeholders across the movement to develop narrative unity and to build the movement's storytelling and messaging capacity and this is a picture at the end of a two-day messaging event that we held last year with 25 organizations from across the UK ecology to share ideas to discuss our research findings and strengthen our coms as a movement uh and finally you know through both the narrative and the strategy work we're starting to develop our cultivator role in the UK ecology so what does all this mean for you and what can you do uh well I've got some ideas um firstly I think it's so important for all of us um myself included to really understand how social change happens and to know some social movement history you know I think it's all our duty as stakeholders in this movement to educate ourselves and a really great place to start would be to read this as an uprising and also doing democracy by Bill Moyer understand your own and others,35
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,37:40,roles and theories of change and how they all work together um I think that you know learning this ecosystem framework for me has really broadened my perspective and has I think created a lot of empathy um that wasn't there before for other groups doing different things um to what I think is the right way and now I realize that all of it is important and all of it works together um and yeah appreciate that all forms of activism are necessary and important there is no one right way um I would also say that we as a movement really need to mobilize the mainstream we need to build a broad base of support and power this isn't some Niche leftist um Movement we have to be able to mobilize the mainstream everyday people across the political Spectrum um I would say all of us need to understand what the outside game is doing and also the potential that it holds for transformational change I think I've said that I think the outside game is one of the the least understood parts of the ecology and um because we,36
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,38:40,really don't have much of it going on I think it's so important especially as as that's the role that really helps to to to for the movement to take off um and yeah for those doing the outside game I think we need to really use disruption and polarization effectively and all of us I think and need to be more audacious because success is the child of audacity so let's be bold and um these are some resources um I think I've mentioned most of them change by Damon centa is also really really good um and yeah please do sign up to our newsletter and if you would like to learn more to chat I'm always happy to receive an email um and I think I'll leave you with this quote which I recently found out Angela Davis did not say and I have been using this quote for at least five years at the end of my talks but I think the sentiment is so um so what really speaks to me above all we have to believe and act as though transformational change as possible if we are going to build a mass movement that is powerful enough to win,37

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,41:54,some Paradox that basically like um you know in social movements activists become like end up being really alienated from the mainstream and also then get very entrenched in their views and we really have to work to be able to bridge that gap between you know the world that we want to see and and the values Etc um and where the mainstream is so I would just say that this is something that all social movement participants face um and in terms of having you know being able to kind of um you know uh stay connected with family friends mainstream I mean I'm probably not the right person to ask because my bubble like my family is all vegan and so I know I work at animal Think Tank and so I really live in a vegan bubble but I think um really developing our our empathy and our and the sort of the the skills and I think a lot of our narrative work could really help with that because it's um I think really connecting on a values level I mean all of us want to live in a world that's caring and kind it's just we're expressing it in different ways I'm wondering if that's actually what you,40
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,43:00,asking so hard when I can't see the questions um let me unmute Alex and you can tell us oh yeah Alex um yeah I want when I was 14 and I didn't meet another one until I was at Uni yeah and you get an onion instead of me on Sunday lunch my brother ends up two in taller and it's like I think a lot of people don't know people like us because we live in our vegan bubble yeah and it's like do we just Target the 10% that are ready or do we start moving people along who are currently buying Red Tractor I don't think we know the answer to that yet but um Martin Luther King and Gandy and Mandela solved it and we need maybe we need some psychologists animal think tank as well as sociologists oh yeah oh we need all sorts of yeah oh yeah Rob Rob we've got Rob um and I just want to like Tracy has said Jonathan smer says in his book that he doesn't identify as an activist because that lets everyone else off the,41
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,44:04,hook and I just I love that because I think ident having an identity that is separate whether it's vegan even though I identify as vegan also activist it does let others off the hook I don't know if that's a speciesist um phrase um but fundamentally it's like we are all ordinary people that want to make the world better and I really think that that framing is is so important and it's like this is how we are living our values and everybody wants to live their values I think it's just you know life is extremely hard we have not everybody's made the connection so just to say thank you to Tracy I love that and we've got another great question from Tom Harris he says the UK animal Liberation movement used to be comprised of autonomous local groups the modern movement tends to be structured more around local chapters of national funded organizations is this a help or a hindrance oh well what can I say I would say that for us at animal Think Tank um we I think subscribe more to the or the vision for our um you know the network of campaigning groups that we would like,42
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,45:10,to help um facilitate is more of the former um of sort of autonomous local groups but who are connected um and information is flowing and trainings are happening and resources are are flowing um rather than having you know a brand or an it's like it's not going to be the ATT chapter of you know in Bristol or whatever it is it's like autonomous local groups and I think I think having that creates a lot more diversity and creative thinking um because I don't think that you know the answer or the great campaign ideas are necessarily going to come from that Center where you know all the local groups are the chapter of I think they're going to come from the Grassroots um you know people know what their communities you know connected to communities they'll know what works there what doesn't work um so I would say I don't want to say whether it's a help or a hindrance but I would say that my personal um preference would be for local autonomous groups that are,43
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,46:09,connected and that can really you know share information and ideas so when something is working somewhere it can spread and others can do it thanks s I'm actually goingon to move to asking people to ask their questions themselves rather than people getting bored of my voice so Jessica if you're um happy to ask your question um so this is justess from HSI UK otherwise I'm happy to read it out for you yes sorry just scrolling up can you hear me yes I can hear you yeah um yeah so basically I just wanted to ask um we've obviously in our organization had a lot of petitions and that kind of thing like a lot of other organizations like asking people to email MPS and take actions and I've found over the past couple of years particularly since like all the broken promises of the government like the kept Animals still getting dropped and stuff like that I've just found people seem to be getting tired there is quite a lot of white noise coming from your sorry can you hear me yeah I'm thinking um people might struggle to hear this so do you,44
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,47:10,want me to read it out if that's yeah that's there is quite a lot of white noise sorry about that no worries yeah Jessica asked um I found over the past couple of years people seem to be getting tired of signing petitions and taking other actions for animals um like emailing the MPS partially after so many years of empty promises from our government such as dropping the kept animals Bill many will say what's the point nothing ever changes so the question is do you have any suggestions for how we reassure people that they do have power and can still make a difference by emailing their MPS well I would say firstly yeah I also feel that frustration um and I think that the fact all these sort of fail like the fail promises and I'm thinking about the the sort of um ending cages in the EU you know it just really says to me we need um an outside game sort of people powerered movement that can really put pressure on power holders and shift public opinion and I think petitions and writing to MPS have their,45
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,48:12,place they're really important and a lot of sort of the kind of more reformist type wins have happened because of that and we need to up our game and get really active so um I think I can totally understand why people feel like it's futile because you know writing letters and petitions and then you know broken promises and I think so rather than I guess reassuring people yeah reassuring people they have power I think we have to have you know more of a pathway or ladder of Engagement so it's yes um you know get involved uh on signing petitions writing to your MP and then there's got to be somewhere else for people to go to really get active um and to to come collectively um and in solidarity and Community with other activists rather than kind of the individual you know sitting at our computer that sort of thing and I would also say that through the strategy consultations and I I've consulted a few local counselors I think there's really untapped potential for local groups to actually be talking to like you know,46
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,49:13,face to face with their local counselors um rather than going straight to their MPS and asking them to do things and putting pressure on in that way so local groups still engaging at the local level I think there's huge potential as especially around things like Animal Welfare issues which is actually local authorities have um you know the remit over Animal Welfare in the UK anyway so yeah I think sorry that was a rather long-winded answer I think it is futile until we really really get active and that's more than signing petitions but that's important too um thanks we've got another great question from Tom Harris I'm gonna um if you want to unmute yourself and ask your question Tom about um us being an ally movement um yes I will just try and find my question again sorry um or I can read I was no I yeah I found it so um what is the path to building Mass public support for a movement comprised entirely of allies,47
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,50:14,which the public not only has no real stake in but in most cases is in some level engaged in the issues we're trying to confront I don't know Tom that is the million dollar question and this is why we've been doing so many consultations um I think I yeah I really think the the piece about being an ally movement um is something that we have to find ways through and sort of our normal or or a lot of the organizing literature and and our um sort of knowledge comes from movements which are not Ally movements and so we I think we are at an edge of learning and that we have to find the way it's not like there's an answer in in in books or research even though that gives us the foundation so I think a lot of it is going to be through experimentation and there's been a lot of you know success and experimentation like we're we're you know at is relatively new and this movement has been going for a really long time um but I think there's something for me around the fact that people care very deeply about other animals um often more deeply,48
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,51:20,I think and it can be more emotive and more moving for people than other issues that um you know ffect humans and when I say they care about animals yes I know when most people um say that they are animal lovers we're talking about dogs and cats and I think for us one of the strategies is um to kind of okay okay so dogs are family members cats are family members and to really find narratives messages and campaigns that can really broaden how we understand you know other animals as family as um you know who love who have their own families Etc and so it's somehow bridging um and and crumbling the hierarchies within you know other animals from Animal Companions farmed animals I mean that's some something that we've been talking about at ATT but Natalie I'm wondering if you have any thoughts because I think narrative plays a really important part here um yeah I mean this is definitely coming through in a lot of the focus groups we doing like people this idea of them being an animal lover someone who cares about animals really does seem to be like the,49
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,52:23,core of people's identity and it's something that they're proud to admit and you know research that's been done in the US by hatway Communications where they kind of pull people and ask you know what are the social justice issues you care most about animal rights conservation was number three like this is a big deal for people so I think like tapping into this idea of like this is something we already care about like we're allies but it's also like a deep part of who we are so yeah we're obviously doing lots of research and testing on this but we think that this um yeah there's lots of opportunity to this um thanks for that great question Tom we still have lots more so we'll just scroll down to another question um so we've got a great question from Amit about introducing um kind of some of this to celebes in schools so am if you're um happy to ask your question um you should be able to unmute yourself now otherwise I can ask it for you okay uh I'm I'm a great believer that children are a clean slate and it is,50
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,53:23,easy to talk to them and make them understand about it but what they are learning right now through their books and through their chapters is Old McDonald had a farm right from nursery and on his farm he had the animals we need to change this narrative so what you were mentioning about yes people are compassionate they are animal lovers but the speciesism gets in they are compassionate towards certain but what we need to do is uh explain them un help them unlearn the speciesist uh language right train the trainers train the teachers talk to them about it and they will come up with question questions about where do we get our nutrition from and your sister Dr Shirin Kasam has done a lovely job with this uh PBP so I uh whenever I'm talking to someone on the street and they ask me about nutrition I just tell them search for full letters PB HP on Google and you'll get all the information about it so I think we should talk to uh focus on the children and then take it on a higher level to their parents and all,51
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,54:25,yeah I me thank you um yeah no I think I think there's so much to be said about um getting in at the sort of the like the education system and and I you know children's Children's n natural compassion at the early age hasn't been completely squashed and disconnected from like you know us adults um so I agree with you um and I think there are groups that are trying to do this there's a great um organization called veganism in education that's getting uh veganism into the sort of uh re curriculum which is I think it's broader than religion it's more like moral um questions and philosophies and they've linked with um oh inter animal Interfaith Alliance I think um to do this I think the vegan Society is also doing this but yeah I absolutely agree I imagine that parents have um quite a lot of um sort of you know if parents were to be organized and also um you know put pressure on schools and ask schools for a broader curriculum and you know also,52
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz4EF2BtDI,How we win animal freedom,Animal Think Tank,13 Mar 2024,55:27,not abusing and using and exploiting animals in education I think there's probably a lot of things that we could be doing at a local level yeah I'm in agreement with you um we are almost at time so I think yeah given we only have two minutes I won't ask um another question but I've put the link in the chat again for anyone who's able to join us we've got another 20 minute session it'll be a more intimate space people can ask a more questions share their insights as well we obviously want to hear all the great work that other visiting and the movement so yeah for others who are able to stay on for a bit longer we'd love to see you in that space so yeah the link is in the chat and yeah we'll see you there in a couple of minutes so thank you everyone for joining hope you um enjoyed this as much as I did and we'll be sharing their recording we could share the slide deck as well and hope to see you at next month's webinar with Garett Ford thanks everyone thank you everyone,53

My name is Naomi Hallum and I work with Generation Vegan. Stories are powerful. Powerful enough also to distort the view that we built as children. They've taught us to stop caring, to stop connecting. They've taught us lies.",1

They've taught us that meat is a necessary part of our diet. What we've always eaten and what we should continue to eat. That meat is the definition of a man. That animals exploited by our food system are happy. These stories have been so powerful and so effectively told that they've disconnected me from my friends and made me see someones as somethings. But stories are powerful enough to disrupt that facade.",2

They put me on the path to who I am today and they shaped my idea of the world. Stories taught me that there are more things that unite us than differentiate us, that we all desire freedom and should be given freedom. They taught me to see animals as more than food, as individuals. They taught me that animals have rich emotional lives, are intelligent, form bonds and friendships.",3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfgjkl6-G_Y,The Power Of Visual Storytelling | Gen V CEO Naomi Hallum,Generation Vegan,26 Dec 2022,1:45,"They taught me to have compassion, to see these individuals as friends, not food and that they deserve so much better than the life that we subject many of them to. They're also teaching us that we can go against social norms, we can make mistakes and we can change our behaviors and try to do better. We can be part of the change and if we don't like something that we see, we can actually stop it.",4

So we've started to reach out to activists that are passionate about more than one injustice, and we tell their stories through the medium of video so that people understand the relationship between human rights and animal rights. How uniting against injustice can be powerful and how veganism can be for everyone.",5

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,1:07,that focus focuses specifically on on human values and what that means for us as individuals but also what values kind of um add up to culturally and what that leads to in terms of the ways that we act and think um and what we believe about one another and the wider world around us and so i've worked in social and environmental uh change for going on 12 years mainly in in campaigning roles um i've done the rounds of lots of the of the big um organizations uh focusing on both human rights uh development and uh more recently environment and and climate issues and but i'm gonna i'm gonna start off by talking to you a little bit about some of my experience and to help us kind of ground um the the wider conversation that we're going to be having about about values so like most people who work in sort of social environmental change um i've always been really preoccupied by by this question that you can see on,2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,2:12,on your screen and how can more people be encouraged to care about and to act on social or environmental injustice um so i believe this is to be really important as in getting more and more people to care about an issue i believe is really important even if you are adopting a sort of what's called an insider influencing strategy um tackling or trying to convince particular decision makers of particular policies or particular ways of working i still believe that um sort of public engagement having the public on your side is is hugely important um but in my experience of of uh working in the world of campaigning i um were sort of considering the scale of the problems that we are that we face in the world on on the one hand um but then i was looking at the tendency that we that we have to focus on on fighting for fairly small incremental policy changes um often driven by a real sense of of,3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,3:18,kind of urgency or needing to prove tangible impacts to to funders um and prioritizing working in that way over and above tackling some of the root causes um for some of the really long term systemic challenges that we faced so i was looking at the challenges that we face on one hand and looking at the approaches or the ways that i was being expected to work as a campaigner on the other and somehow this just wasn't wasn't adding up to me and this gained clarity for me in my head when i went to an arcade and played a game of whack-a-mole which has we could talk about the narrative implications of that game for a long time um but it kind of dawned on me that it's very similar to the way that we try to make change happen currently so it's this idea of um [Music] whack-a-mole for anyone who doesn't know it is a is a horrendous game where um you um are expected to hit a sort of plastic mole on the head with a plastic,4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,4:22,mallet and it's a game of reactions you're trying to hit as many moles as you can in a particular um period of time and and this for me felt really like what campaigning feels like where you are considering how you can go about solving a particular issue pushing back on a particular issue uh in in the best way in the best most effective way that you can or you know how you can best kind of whack that individual role um but no matter how many times you succeed in in winning one particular campaign which is hard and you don't always do that anyway there's another issue just around the corner there's another mole which is just about to pop up and it really got me wondering about okay well what's underlying um these problems what is underlying these issues that are causing them to appear again and again and again um this frustration led me to lots of of kind of reading and reflecting um and eventually it led me to the work of of common cause,5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,5:23,and others who are focused on on values and uh what we call deep narratives um so there's a really brief introduction to to common core sometimes called ccf um common core started life as as a report um my colleague tom crompton was working at wwf at the time and was wanting to explore an alternative approach to creating change uh based on an understanding of social psychology so based on an understanding of what motivates people to show concern for a really broad range of social and environmental issues and it started life as a report and then it sort of grew from there and now it's an established uh not-for-profit um i say established there's only three of us in the team we're super tiny um and what we focus on is fostering what we call values literacy so an understanding of what we can learn from the social psychology of values,6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,6:22,and and then experimenting or kind of exploring with different partners what bringing to life and understanding of values kind of looks like for for our work so all of our work is focused on on social environmental change and creating what we call the cultural conditions that are needed to um to create this kind of like flourishing environment for social environmental transformation to take place so this session is um pretty jam-packed there's an awful lot there's decades of research in social psychology into values um absolutely impossible to cram that into an hour so we're going to be taking you through some of the highlights and if you're left with lots of questions that is absolutely fine and we can we can take questions later but i'm also just an email away and if anyone wants to join values 101 which was the um the course that that natalie joined you uh you would be very very welcome to,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,7:24,so what i'm going to be talking about today so i'm going to introduce the concept of values and that is uh um as it is defined in the social psychological literature um and we're gonna explore some of the research findings um that exists on on how values interact with one another we're then going to consider why values are so important when we're considering social or environmental change and i will introduce you to two concepts um called intrinsic values and extrinsic values and then we're going to start to consider some of the implications of this research on on our work uh which how how does it apply how can it help us do our work more effectively so um to kick us off in much campaigning and sort of advocacy work today we rely on a theory of change um that sort of says that change happens um when we focus on issue specific tactics,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,8:30,so it's this idea that a group of us over here are going to focus on housing justice and then a group of us over here we're going to focus on animal freedom and a group of us over here we're going to focus on climate action etcetera and we're all going to work really really hard to solve our particular problem and that is going to add up to a transformed world where suddenly all of these incredible visions for the future that we all hold are real and happening around us now often this takes the form of defining a particular problem and then attempting to make people aware of that problem um stressing to them you know how bad it is this is an awful situation uh you need to take action and um trying to rely on on what we feel is um uh you know people's empathy um for either other others around them animals or the the more than human world um when we work in this way our work is often um sort of defined by a set of measurable objectives um related to,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,9:36,particular programs or particular projects that we're working on um and this this normally entails us kind of examining the factual basis for addressing um a challenge and then engaging in debate about the best practical approach to achieving that change but social psychology um uh and the research that has come out over the uh the field of social psychology over the last 60 years shows us that there are really two limitations to this approach so firstly is something called the information deficit model um and this means that although we as as campaigners often feel that it's a lack of understanding and that is the reason why people don't act or don't support the cause that we uh feel so passionate about so we want to give them all the facts we're going to try and raise awareness that is a term that you hear all the time in sort of campaigning circles um um is this sort of sense of if only people knew they would behave,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,10:38,differently they would feel differently um well unfortunately human beings just don't tend to make decisions in that way and we we aren't partic we aren't as rational as as we would like to think that we are and actually we we tend to make decisions largely due to how to how we feel and often that is very very subconscious um tapping into the to the level of values and emotion so just telling people the facts um really isn't going to be enough to get them to support whatever cause it is that you're championing the second um limitation that we learn about when we reflect on what social psychology tells us about how people are motivated is that organizations aren't sort of taking into consideration the wider culture in which their work taste takes place so this is sometimes called iatrogenic effects um iatrogenic in the medical terminology is an effect isn't is an unintended negative effect from,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,11:40,taking a particular course of medical action so either a medication or surgery something like that it's an idea that although that particular intervention could be really positive there might be negative unintended consequences that come about and we see this in our campaigning work we don't tend to measure it but there can be so there can be cases whereby we feel like we are acting in the most effective way for the cause that we are tampering but that actually we can be having unintended negative effects without even realizing um [Music] sometimes we refer to this as as kind of winning the battle but losing the war so before we go any further i'm going to kind of really make clear what i mean when i'm talking about when i'm talking about values um so in all of our work we convey particular values it's really inevitable,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,12:42,you might never have considered values before but um i can pretty much guarantee that you will have engaged values in in your communications work um but there is an abundance of social psychological research that tells us that there are some values which provide a better source of motivation for engaging people with what is tend to be called bigger than self problems so issues that may not directly affect them but affect the wider world around us so when i use the term values what i'm referring to is the principles or standards that we each carry throughout our lives and that guide and inform our thoughts our attitudes and our actions our values influence and are influenced by our experience of the society in which we each live they help determine what is important to us and how we interact with other people,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,13:44,and the more than human world these values in the way that i'm speaking about values the way that social psychology defines values is different to how we might understand corporate values or our organizational values this is much more about us as individuals as human beings and what motivates us um to to to act or believe or think certain ways so a common cause we use a particular values framework developed by an academic called sharlem schwartz so this colorful map that you can see here lists 58 values and they are the the individual um kind of bullet points around the map and then those 58 values are split into what's called ten values categories so these are things that you can see um bolded in in different colors so universalism benevolence tradition conformity etc,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,14:48,so social psychologists identified these 58 values following decades of research and hundreds of cross-cultural studies the 58 values that you can see represented on this map are the most consistently occurring human values when researchers asked what people value most in life so this is held over nearly 100 countries but like all frameworks it's not it's not perfect there are going to be things that are missing here um uh there there are communities that um social psychologists have not engaged with in terms of um building building this map so it's not perfect we use it because there is a lot of data on it it is the most widely used framework it uh forms the basis of the european value survey and the world value survey which tells us the most um about about people's values across the world so i'm going to introduce you to some basic facts about or basic principles about how sort of values work and how they interact with one another,15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,15:54,um so the values can be complementary to one another or they can be antagonistic and this is shown visually on the map by the position of each of the values of the individual values items so for example the closer they are so these two values up here equality protecting the environment they're next they're next to each other on the map they're very close together that indicates that they are more complementary and what that means is that it's it's more likely that one person is going to place priority on both of those values at the same point in time but when they're further apart on the map so here we've got protecting the environment in the top right and we've got social power in the bottom left uh the further apart two values are the more antagonistic they are and what that means is that it's difficult it's psychologically difficult,16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,16:51,for somebody to prioritize both protecting the environment and social power at the same point in time and this holds you can look at any values around the map let's look at um accepting my portion of life which is down in the in the bottom right hand corner um that's complementary to the value of moderate which is next door to it but it's antagonistic to the value of freedom up in the top left um and we can say this and when we refer to the positionality of any of these values that that relationship um is consistent whether two values are complementary or antagonistic and that explains why we have this this kind of spread of values it's not a sort of random scattering the positionality of each of these values is really really important so something else to consider is that everyone has access to all of the values on this map um sometimes when we talk about values we will make assumptions about the values that people hold so we might say,17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,17:56,well you know my uncle who comes to christmas and is always going on about the economy for example he sits down in this power category these are the values that he cares about and he doesn't care about any other values now that's not the way that values work for human beings we as individuals apart from potentially a very small number of psychopaths we all have access to all of the values around this around this map we may find that we we spend more time in certain areas depending on our upbringing our education our faith if we have one if we don't etcetera but we have access to all of these values and so we jump around depending on what um cues what triggers we're experiencing in in our life so when we're thinking about social and environmental change there are two groups of values that we're particularly interested in intrinsic values,18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,18:59,and extrinsic values intrinsic values are inherently rewarding to us while extrinsic seek external reward or approval so intrinsic values live up here in the top right hand corner of the map they are the values that come from the compar that comp comprise goodness me benevolence universalism and sort of this half the right-hand side of self-direction those are intrinsic values extrinsic values live down here in the bottom left-hand corner of the map it's comprised of achievement and power the values that make up those two values categories now we're particularly interested in these two groups for a couple of reasons firstly they're antagonistic to each other what we were just talking about intrinsic values are located or positioned in the top right of the map,19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,19:59,and extrinsic are positioned in the bottom left they're far apart from each other on the map so we know it's really difficult for somebody to hold extrinsic and intrinsic values to be important at the same time the second reason why we're particularly interested in these two groups of values is um that research has suggested and there is a huge body of research looking at this that when someone prioritizes intrinsic values when they spend more time um engaging those values of benevolence universalism and some of self-direction um they are more likely to report stronger connection to their community they're more likely to engage civically so they're more likely to vote they're more likely to volunteer they're more likely to report higher levels of well-being so they're more likely to be happy and importantly for us as campaigners they are more likely to show deeper levels of support for social,20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,21:02,environmental policies so importantly for us um as as campaigners and as communicators whether someone prioritizes intrinsic values is the best predictor of whether they are likely to engage in pro-social or pro-environmental behaviors and attitudes that is not to say that extrinsic values are bad and intrinsic values are good we need a mix of all of them um to be sort of well-rounded human beings but we know that there is a particular importance to intrinsic values in bringing about social and environmental change so when we're thinking about when we're thinking about change there are two um uh groups of values that we are focused on intrinsic and extrinsic what the research suggests is that we need to be considering how we can strengthen intrinsic values throughout our work and this is important for two reasons we've talked about the fact that um,21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,22:09,there is a correlation between people placing prioritization on intrinsic values and then showing deeper levels of support um for change um but there are a couple of other principles of how values work together that help us sort of cement um this argument so the first one is called the seesaw effect um so if i show you a piece of communication which engages the value of of social justice which is up in the top right hand corner it's an intrinsic value the value of wealth which is in the extrinsic uh category of values on the opposite side of the map that value is actively disengaged and the same holds the other way around so if i show you a piece of communication that gets you thinking about your social power for example in that moment uh the the um the value of social justice or of protecting the environment or of a quality or of a value that lives up in the in the top right hand corner,22

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,24:11,you for you to use those muscles in future values work in a very very similar way so the more that we engage the more time we spend in a particular part of the values map it becomes easier for us to engage those values in future and so although we can encourage pro-social or pro-environmental attitudes and behavior through engaging extrinsic values those values of wealth and power and success etc and what we're doing is strengthening the power of those values in the long term which we know has a negative effect because the um of that of that research finding that people that prioritize intrinsic values are are found to be more likely to engage um and show support for for social environmental policies so if i asked you why you do the work you do um or or you know what you feel the programs that you run,24

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,26:15,although we are unlikely to assume this so the good news is is that the majority of people do place priority on intrinsic values so this is some data from the uk so 70 74 of the uk population place importance on on those intrinsic values the problem is is that we as campaigners and as citizens generally um don't tend to to believe this to be the case we feel that you know we might believe certain things or we might feel certain things but everybody else is is really self-interested and that infiltrates how we communicate with them it maybe encourages us to use extrinsic values in our in our comms to try and prime those particular values because we assume that other people hold them to be the case so as an organization um we can consider the the kind of values that we amplify in in our own work and,26
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,27:16,we can do this in a number of ways so we can look at how we frame our messages how we can frame them in a slightly different way to elevate those intrinsic values we can also consider what values are being strengthened through the for the policies that we're advocating for for now we're going to just look at the uh at point number one we're going to look at um look at framing so i'm going to introduce you to to some examples i'm going to give you some time to read two different texts text a and text b i'd like you to have a read of both of them and then consider what text is invoking intrinsic values and what one is invoking extrinsic values so um some people find it difficult to read the text on the screen so i've just dropped a um a link in the chat box where which you are very welcome to to use instead of reading the text on the screen is exactly the same text so text a and text b i'll give you a couple of minutes just,27
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,28:22,have a read through and i want you to consider which text is engaging intrinsic values and which is engaging extrinsic so intrinsic is values like social justice equality protecting the environment care for our natural world care for those around us extrinsic values are those in the opposite side of the map things like wealth social power um status preserving my public image success okay i'll give you a couple of minutes just to read these two texts so text a okay could i have a virtual thumbs up from people if you've been able to read next day amazing brilliant thank you okay i will move on to text b give you a couple of minutes to read that,28

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,34:47,and through our through our communications um and that is because of our our work um plays a part in reinforcing and establishing the kind of wider culture in which we live and in in that wider culture is ultimately um where we see our campaigns uh succeed or fail so i'm going to expand on that just slightly so at the moment we live in a world which is constantly foregrounding and exercising our extrinsic values we receive thousands of messages um every day week month year that champions are extrinsic values that we should be thinking about money and our wealth we should be thinking about how we look we should be thinking about our success etc we should be thinking and acting in a way that consumes more and more and more um but as we mentioned and as i mentioned earlier values strengthen over over time so the more that um these values these,32
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,35:49,extrinsic values are being engaged for us the stronger that they are becoming and the more likely we are to draw on them when we're making decisions in the future so when we're deciding how to act when we're deciding who to vote for when we're deciding what to believe we um we we will fall back on values that are that are strong for us and this is a real problem when we think about social change when we think about that relationship that antagonistic relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic values so what common cause argues is that any organization that is seeking social environmental transformation has a duty has a responsibility to engage those intrinsic values through their work to strengthen those intrinsic values through their work not just because they are the values that are going to make our own communications more persuasive but they are the values that we need to see strengthened across our culture to create those conditions to create that public demand um that is so needed,33

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,42:05,and so yeah i have spent a lot of time talking with people about their career choices um after values 101. thanks um does anyone else have either a comment or a question you'd like to pick daniella hi thank you so much thank you first of all root that was amazing um for me particularly was the first time hearing about this i mean i think we we already we were already using values but not knowing that we were doing that so i think my question to you is don't you think it's possible i know you talked a lot about they them they being antagonistic but um some somehow i think we try to include all in our communication and maybe that's a mistake so we try to include those intrinsic values but at the same time empowering the person and i can give you an example so it's like take action today you're gonna help millions of animals only you can do this so in this quick example here is like you,39
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,43:15,bring the world a necessity the thing that you're helping uh animals environment whatever it is but on uh with the way that you conduct the text you you empower the person saying that only they are capable of doing so so i don't know i always thought that they were complement complementary in that sense but can you talk a little bit about this you think it's possible to bring everything in the same copy yeah oh really good really good question daniella and um yeah such a common comms tactic i think when we're when we're trying to engage people um so a couple of things spring to mind so firstly um there sometimes we can get a little bit muddled with how we're thinking about values and that's that's not made easy by the fact that the social psychology literature has like a very specific definition of of what is included by values whereas values as a word is sort of thrown around in our like public rhetoric um you know all the time so firstly i would say that there is a difference between values as a,40
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,44:21,characteristic and values as a motivation now i'll explain a little bit what i mean by that so the social psychology is interested in values as a motivation not as a characteristic and the difference is um i'm gonna ask you to picture um uh nelson mandela in your mind now he is somebody who was really motivated by those intrinsic values you know that's he gave his his whole career his life was hugely um uh determined and influenced by those intrinsic values now we could say that he was also someone who had a lot of success he had a lot of he had a big public image he might have even had a lot of wealth i don't know um kind of off of the back of um the way that he lived his life driven by those intrinsic values so we could say that his motivation was intrinsic values but he could be described as someone who had a characteristic of sort of success or public image status something like that whereas if we think of someone like,41
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,45:24,donald trump and i don't know donald trump so i might be wrong but um i can imagine that donald trump is someone who maybe is really motivated uh um because of four extrinsic values in and of themselves his motivation is success his motivation is wealth his motivation is power etcetera it's not those things aren't characteristics for him those are his end goals and so when we're talking about values we're thinking about those intrinsic values we're thinking about motivations so somebody can be um in that in your example daniella of sort of um you know take this action you're going to help etcetera the motivation i would argue is probably still intrinsic values um but somebody might have a characteristic of then having you know made themselves feel a little bit better i've done something good today so that's not necessarily a bad thing um,42
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,46:22,what the other thing i would say is that we have to be very careful when we're constructing our comms as to what values we're engaging so there are different ways that people could respond to or or an organization could change their tactic when they're thinking about values um one of those is to um be heavily influenced by a sort of social marketing um approach which would be to um try and see okay well we think our particular audience are really motivated by extrinsic values hedonism values you know all that they care about is having good time or all they care about is getting more money and so we are going to try and sell or persuade that audience to engage with our work through speaking to those values so you see this a lot in um an environmental campaigning where it's like buy this buy this environmentally friendly car and you're going to look,43
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,47:24,super cool and sexy and speaking to those sorts of values but trying to do something intrinsic that's one way you can respond the second way you can respond is what i often call like throw spaghetti at the wall is sort of just engage everything and hope something sticks for somebody and this i think is often what organizations do they engage intrinsic they engage extrinsic they engage every value they can think of and they hope that something jumps out in that comms for the individual now what has happened is in the research is that um people firstly feel like that sort of commons is is inauthentic they're kind of like what are you standing for here i don't really understand what you know what is your motivation for telling me this thing um but more importantly the comm shows that and i think this is probably due to the cultural setting that we're in um culturally extrinsic values are so strong that when we read a text that has,44
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,48:23,a bit of everything in it it's extrinsic values which are the most prominent they jump out the most for us and so uh in a text that that primes a bit of everything it's likely to be um extrinsic values that are the sort of the sticker so we say we should intrinsic values in all of our comms and it isn't joe uh will will engage everything but as long as intrinsic's in there it's okay it's specifically engage intrinsic and do not engage extrinsic um i think with your example danielle of of kind of um making someone feel empowered that's probably more to do with the framing of how extrinsic that is as to whether you did it or not um [Music] you could talk about um [Music] you can remind somebody of the importance that they place on those,45
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,49:23,intrinsic values it's through reference to um you know the world around them um animals um [Music] the importance that animals have for our kind of ecosystem as a whole etc and then um invite them to join your you know you know join with thousands of others across the world who are taking action today etcetera it's it's extrinsic but it's it's intrinsic i mean but it's sort of still got that empowering aspect it's reminding people that they are one of many in in a way that is maybe slightly different than focusing just on them um that's what i would that's what i would say those are the things that came to mind from your question anyway thank you and jeremy i think you have a question next yeah um i uh apologize i did join a bit late so i apologize if any of this was covered i look forward to watching the um the video back though because this is a fascinating subject i mean communication especially language is just that's,46
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,50:23,that's that's my jam so um the intrinsic versus extrinsic thing i find quite interesting because i think when we look at motivating people um there's so many things we can speak to and i guess a few things like yourself fruit that sounds like a few things kind of come to mind when we're trying to unpack these massive subjects but i guess if we're appealing to someone for extrinsic things is that going to be like a lasting motivational moral change um and and i guess alongside that you know the common thing i think that's done in the animals movement is to appeal to the the the holy trinity of the of you know animals earth and health and i'm just worried if by you know your example of throwing spaghetti at the wall we're actually diluting the message a bit when we do that and um yeah yeah yeah really great question jeremy um so i'm gonna take your the second half of your question first um that's it's super interesting that you've said that that like there's this that potentially there's a there's a sense that we're diluting the issue area,47
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,51:25,if we if we sort of combine um animal freedom with any other type of issue area that we might talk about um i i completely understand why you feel that way and that is often uh i mean it's the way that we have sort of designed civil society across the world is to be kind of like we're going to work on this issue over here and then we're going to work on this issue over here and um sometimes we'll collaborate if there's some direct policy overlap but otherwise it's it's almost a world of competition whereby you know i'm trying to speak the loudest to the public to get them to realize that the problem that i work on is the most urgent and the most awful and they need to give our you know give me attention so that or give me money or whatever it might be um encouragingly that's not actually how sort of social psychology works that's not really how we as human beings um understand issues and so there is a another kind of element of research which we cover in values 101,48
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,52:28,but we haven't gone into detail here um called the bleed over effect which is a really horrible name for something that i actually think is is really powerful and this is again it refers to the positionality of those values on the map so values that are very close together people can hold to be very important at the same time so actually what has been found is that when somebody reads a text say it's talking about the environment they can read a text that's intrinsically primed getting them to think about their love for the natural world and then they can be asked to support a disability rights organization and they will be more likely to do that than if they were to be given a text that was extrinsically talking about um the benefits of of supporting disability justice so it we're not um our kind of the way that we approach issues as individuals is is much um more sort of blurred than how we approach it as campaigners um,49
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,53:30,people everyday people when they are reading a piece of comms that is priming their intrinsic values they will they will understand the connections between maybe not on a pragmatic sort of policy sense but the values that underpin their care for the environment and their values that underpin their care for health and that the values that underpin their care for the environment are the same values and so when you strengthen one you sort of strengthen them all and so there's a whole body of of work um that that talks about um no causes in ireland and there's a a research report on our on our website about this that actually we have come to separate out causes um very deliberately in our work but that's not supported by the social psychology by the social psychological literature and how we as human beings actually um care for numerous things at the same time which um yeah i find really encouraging um and the first half of your question,50
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,54:32,i'm now gonna forgotten what it was was you remind me sorry yeah you know i appreciated a two-parter didn't mean to sleep on you um i guess just like when we're looking at the motivations like and i guess it goes back to the second part of the question that the motivation is you know i want to lose weight like if we're not doing it for our fellow animals then are we actually doing it for not just the right reasons but you know from a psychology perspective um my understanding is the research that it's very limited but that's the most powerful motivator there is you know and and i don't know some people might start the dietary aspects of veganism and actually gain weight you know and all of a sudden they were told to do this for their health they're gaining weight and if they're not doing you know if they don't have the right white power um you know what will the the change be sustainable and really connect on a deep moral level that i think is necessary not to just do it for a week or a month or a year but you know for a lifetime yeah absolutely so um you can prime people through or you can get somebody to behave in a certain way,51
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,55:32,or to take a certain action through engaging their extrinsic values so you can say you know you're going to look really great if you become a vegan like you're going to look as the sexiest you've ever looked etcetera that could make somebody engage with your campaign that could make them adopt the behavior that you are encouraging them to adopt but what it does is it strengthens a particular set of values which are um a counter to the values that we need to see strengthened at that cultural level um uh for kind of systemic support for um social environmental policies so what would happen is you engage them through an extrinsic prime there might be a small take up in um in in behavior they might uh you know recycle or whatever it might be that you're encouraging them to do but uh that is soon going to kind of plateau out again whereas intrinsic values if we're engaging for intrinsic values what we're doing is strengthening those intrinsic kind of muscles,52
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,56:36,um making it easier and easier for people to um refer back to those values when they are making a decision and i'd say refer back to this is never a conscious process or very very rarely a conscious process this is something that people are doing very automatically um and also feeding a culture in which we are a group of people we are a society that believe that um treating animals with respect and dignity is the right thing to do and we're sort of creating that culture in which any decisions any institutions that we build any policies that we make any laws that we pass are done in a culture where that narrative is really powerful um and that has much longer lasting um uh kind of power i guess so yes there there is a sort of there can be a short term gain in in engaging through engaging somebody through extrinsic values but that has long term negative implications for for our work,53
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,57:38,and i'm always trying to find a different um metaphor because i don't really like the the imagery that comes with losing um like winning the battle but losing the war but that is the kind of that's the kind of idea that i guess um i'm i'm getting at thank you thanks um jeremy and yeah just in kind of relation to that point i remember you saying to me ruth during the court in the course the 101st values course i was asking about testing because that's something we're going to be doing an animal think tank and asking about you know testing certain values and that through testing extrinsic values messaging might actually show to be more persuasive than intrinsic but we should never kind of go with what seems more persuasive if it's extrinsic because it's going to be that thing of short-term gains but long-term it could really hinder us over time so yeah i really took that away from the course um,54
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,58:36,we do have a question from aim apologies i'm not pronouncing your name correctly but um i'll read it out unless you want to jump on and ask ruth directly um i'm happy to go ahead and read it oh are you gonna speak okay yeah um so first sorry that i cannot open the camera but i mean state that way it's better to be off so my question is um i'm not sure if it's like a practical to answer but do you think that these strategies can be applied to the eastern world as well because as we know that in cultural psychology or social psychology research mostly focus on population from the western world and have like specific characteristics that are shared which is really really small um percentage compared to other sites like other parts of the world and i i personally uh care i'm curious that um if i would like to apply these strategies and findings in countries,55
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,59:45,like for example in thailand is there anything that i can uh look out or keep in mind something like that thank you yeah a brilliant a brilliant question thank you um so well i guess there isn't there isn't uh um a clear-cut answer for this um because any research any framework has its limitations like this is not a a sort of silver bullet unfortunately um i think the the issues that we face globally are far more complicated than any framework that we could apply so these are principles and i think they sit alongside lots of other best practice in in communications and public engagement and having said that so um the social psychology research base in which this framework uh it kind of comes comes from um is has has looked at values um and gathered information about what,56
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,1:00:49,people value in just under 100 countries across the world um those span um uh europe north and south america africa and asia so they they have data on what people value from from all parts of the world and it is surprisingly consistent um what people value where where we differ so let me just let me just get up um the picture of the map because i see the map in my sleep but um you guys might not um so um [Music] all of these values have been found to um uh be important to people from all different countries so in every country where there has been research done around this so just under 100 and those are across different,57
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,1:01:58,continents um these are the values that that most consistently come out as being important where cultures differ is um the prioritization that they might place on certain values so for example in the uk benevolence values this group here it's one of the intrinsic values categories are the most important values for people they come out as number one nearly every time um these values are just super super powerful for people um but that might be different to the the value group that comes out as being the most powerful for uh people in in thailand or people in mexico or people wherever most of the time benevolence values is number one from every data from most of the data i've seen i think it is rwanda that is the only country that doesn't prioritize benevolence values um they it's still important to them but i believe they put more priority on tradition now we could speculate as to why that is,58
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,1:03:03,um but and and i i might i'm not the last time i looked at that research was a couple of years ago so it might be out of date now maybe there's maybe there's differences and covid that could have made some real impacts for people across the world etc um but what i'm trying to say is this framework roughly it's not perfect um can be used across different countries where i think there is um more sensitivity is um in countries that have um maybe a more authoritarian government so in cultures whereby perhaps there is more stress on conformity in tradition values for example now we have we we don't really talk that much in in the in this session about the other the other groups so i've i've spoken to you about self-direction universalism benevolence and achievement and power those are extrinsic the top ones are intrinsic um often people will ask well what about all these other value categories in in,59

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,1:05:07,on um on on the data so it's not perfect um but in terms of its kind of top lines um that most of us across the world seem to value this selection of values we seem to jump around this kind of this map um and we find it difficult to prioritize both intrinsic values and extrinsic at the same time that seems to hold kind of culturally across the world and so we work with activists in in different parts of the world um who work in very different political economic social contexts um and uh yeah there's there's various degrees of success um in in each of those but they all come with their own their own kind of um questions and complexities i hope that helps yeah thank you for answering and now do i see you have a question yes hello um ruth thank you so so much it was very eye-opening very very much,61
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,1:06:11,so i do activism work in both the uk and in turkey and my question is how you said we need to strengthen the intrinsic values messages in our communications my problem what makes me question that is how do we do that without sounding so preachy and in our moral high horse because in my experience i've found um i've been i think vegan for almost 10 years i draw people in through extreme extrinsic values you know health um clear skin um you know fitness beauty um and then once they get hooked in i expose them to intrinsic values and i know that sticks i know the intrinsic message sticks um but how would it work the other way around if i you know,62
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,1:07:09,in my experience that hasn't worked for me i've done lots of student activism but how how can we do that without sounding um preachy and um you know morally um yeah morally preachy i'd say how what's your top tip it's a really good question and um yeah something that i think people come up against when when trying to implement this kind of approach and practice um it can be it can you know there's a risk of it being preachy there's a risk of it being like all we need is love and kindness which i think can make people feel that's that's just so wet and soppy and that can't possibly be the answer to the huge huge challenges that we face globally um so completely understand the the hesitation um i'm gonna um show our trusty map again um so i think there's a couple of ways um around that part partly it's it's a,63
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,1:08:11,framing issue being able to engage um universalism values in a way that doesn't sound preachy that sounds um really authentic and reminds people of um the values that they already hold um so it's not saying like um you know don't you care about uh animals or don't you care about the world around you or whatever it might be um but but reminding them of but of care they already place so saying something that's much more about um um you know we as um we as as people um uh have some of our happiest moments in in nature for example or something like that that's still an intrinsic frame but it's framed very differently um i would also say that something that we really a trap that we fall into a lot as campaigners and i have done this for my,64
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,1:09:12,whole career um is is is focus on these universalism values and only those that is um you know partly because we ourselves are probably motivated to do the jobs that we do because we are really motivated by these values these intrinsic these universalism values and so we we sort of go in with these like really big grand messages about like well this is just and this is moral and this is right etc um which i think can really be infuriating for a lot of public um what i i love about intrinsic values is that there is these other ones too there's benevolence and there's self-direction those are also intrinsic values they do the same job as universalism values but they allow us to talk about issues in a slightly different way um in a with a different framing so um you know sometimes in our training we play a game um called value sushi which um allows us to uh to get someone to be,65
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,1:10:12,thinking about a message that they want to send and then they have a pack of cards that has the list of of all of the intrinsic values on and they pick a card and if they get the value of let's say creativity they need to think about how they frame their message using that intrinsic value of creativity or maybe they get the value of loyal etcetera it's a good way of trying to stimulate um ideas for different types of messaging that pull on intrinsic values but aren't the constant ones that we always draw on which are probably protecting the environment unity with nature a world of beauty um last point um is something called the benevolence pivot so what we see in uh more sort of right wing messaging often is that um an audience member will be primed to be thinking about benevolence values and benevolence values of the love that we have for our friends our family our local community so the sort of us i guess people that we could would consider to be like us,66
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,1:11:15,um will be primed to think about those and then um the comms will pivot down into thinking about tradition and conformity and into security values so you see this an awful lot with um messaging in in the uk for example and also in the us around refugees so there'll be this sense of um you know look at the beautiful community you live in isn't it wonderful that you get to uh be in this in this great place and this is at risk because of um you know uh illegal migrants or illegal refugees coming over etc we need stronger refugee um policies laws whatever um what what is a is an opportunity for those uh more progressive communicators to do and isn't something that happens often is to pivot the other way so to prime benevolence values remind people of the love that they have for their friends their family those around them so in the terms of animal freedom this could be pets this could be pets this could be animals that we see on our commute to work every day you know,67
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,1:12:21,animals that we see in our local parks whatever and then expand that circle of us so universalism values our values uh is is the um the love the admiration that we feel for those that are further away from us so people that we wouldn't necessarily include in our us category um but we can extend that social of care that that circle of care so we can prime benevolence values and then pivot outwards into talking about other animals or other people or other environments etc that's another common tactic which um we can we can use we can employ to try and shake up our the way that we frame those intrinsic values and and get a little bit more creative and benevolence pivot is particularly can be particularly powerful because so many people place importance on benevolence values um i hope that helps that was amazing thank you and so um you would say starting with benevolence values prior,68
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,1:13:27,to all the other interes intrinsic values is more effective it can be it's not so there's there's very little research on the power of benevolent of of the of the possibility of the benevolence pivot it's still a fairly new tactic i suppose that's being explored and i i think if you think about those around you those in your life people you know most people the thing that they care most about is their family their friends and their family you know maybe their house like where they live um those are really important to people and they that that plays a big part in how we act um what we think and feel what we believe etc so there can be a sense of uh it can be quite quick to remind people of that by priming intrinsic by priming benevolence values and then what we're wanting to do is sort of expand that circle of care out into uh people that maybe don't live near us don't look like us don't share the same,69

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,1:16:37,terms of these values i'm wondering because it seems more intuitive to actually speak to this um audience with uh extrinsic values you know like profit uh market etc and i know that that there are uh people behind the the corporate uh identities um but still i find it challenging to to find the right language and that's why i'm looking for knowledge and sources to approach that topic so i'm wondering if you maybe have some thoughts on that or some experience yeah brilliant um great question cassie and it comes up without fail um every time every time i talk to people about about values um is is kind of this makes sense but what about this particular group of people or what about this particular audience like we have to speak to them in extrinsic ways because that is is that's their motivation um,72
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,1:17:35,um there's a couple of things to bear in mind here i think there's a big difference between um public communication so public-facing communications that seep in into the kind of public consciousness and help um reinforce that kind of cultural surround the cultural waters that we all swim in every day and there is a difference between comms like that and comms that are behind closed doors so if you are working with um i don't know the finance the chief financial officer at um a big supermarket um they might be sort of professionally constrained to be thinking about profit and to be thinking about things that that potentially fall into that achievement and power category maybe they're thinking about the brand risk for the organization they're thinking about their success as a company what their stakeholder what their shareholders are going to think etc now you might decide that you need to speak to them in an extrinsic way but,73
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,1:18:37,that is happening kind of behind closed doors in a meeting room um and that's kind of contextual to the conversation it's not necessary it's not the kind of public facing comms um that's my first point so i think there is there is a there is always a sense of you know what risk do we want to to weigh up here um [Music] and i think occasionally we're working with individuals who are professionally constrained to be thinking about extrinsic values and we need to then engage them through extrinsic means um but that can happen without the public facing kind of comms of the work uh being extrinsically motivated you can you can frame everything else to all of the other audiences intrinsically and have that kind of closed-door meeting with whoever you might need to um,74
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,1:19:37,the other thing i would say and people sort of roll their eyes sometimes with this but i i kind of i do believe it's really powerful um is that people in those roles are people who have perhaps been drawn to that role because they um place a lot of power that because they place a lot of priority on those extrinsic values or they can be someone that you know found themselves in that sort of role in that type of job and because they are having to engage with those values every day they become stronger for them um there has been incident instances uh where people in those sorts of roles have come forward and said i found it so refreshing to be spoken to like an individual um and reminded of these things i care about that actually my job gives me little room to explore so an example of this is um nick clegg,75
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,1:20:39,who was a senior politician here in the uk he was taken on so an environmental organization was wanting him to to bring in a particular policy to uh try and pass a particular policy through our our government and he they'd been campaigning for years to get this to happen um and he'd been really reluctant um he was eventually invited to go for a walk in in a forest in a protected natural area um here near london and it it engaged intrinsic values for him he was out in nature which in and of itself is proven to be this kind of intrinsic experience we're able to be reminded of how much we love our natural world and he he found that a truly transformative experience and this policy he backed this policy after years of campaigning work um and that was because he suddenly was connected on that level as a sort of human being so i'm not saying that that always works,76
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QUKzeCIJ4,Unlocking the Power of Values in our Communications - Ruth Taylor,Animal Think Tank,10 Aug 2022,1:21:44,and it's not going to always work and you know it really depends on who the person is and what the context is etcetera but i think that we're we're quite often so quick to cancel out the possibility of talking to people in in a different way because it's not what we normally do that um uh we miss opportunities there so yeah that that was something and um and also highlights the the importance of experience that it's not just comms um where our values are engaged our values are engaged all day every day um by by kind of you know walking through the world that we live in and engaging in the world that we where you know we all inhabit so if you can find ways to engage people that kind of go beyond comms as well that also can be very very powerful thank you,77

drag queen in Brazil.
 
2
00:00:05.00 --> 00:00:10.00
I had no reference
of vegan people in my life,
 
3
00:00:10.01 --> 00:00:12.30
but I have a degree in physical education
 
4
00:00:12.31 --> 00:00:15.00
and I have always been
interested in healthy eating.
 
5
00:00:15.01 --> 00:00:17.00
I began to research
some things,
 
6
00:00:17.01 --> 00:00:19.00
and a friend of mine from the gym
where I work,
 
7
00:00:19.00 --> 00:00:22.00
asked me to watch
some documentaries.
 
8
00:00:22.01 --> 00:00:24.30
Then I watched Cowspiracy.
 
9
00:00:24.31 --> 00:00:28.50
And I was really shocked
by all the information
 
10
00:00:28.51 --> 00:00:32.00
that was there and that
had never reached me
 
11
00:00:32.01 --> 00:00:34.00
through any media.
 
12
00:00:34.01 --> 00:00:37.00
So, then, I watched
Meat Is Weak,
 
13
00:00:37.01 --> 00:00:39.00
it was the second documentary
that I watched.
 
14
00:00:39.01 --> 00:00:42.50
And when I saw what
happens to animals,
 
15
00:00:42.51 --> 00:00:45.00
that they didn't just appear
in the butcher shop,
 
16
00:00:45.01 --> 00:00:49.00
for me it was impossible to
keep living that way.
 
17
00:00:49.01 --> 00:00:50.30
The day I watched
Cowspiracy,
 
18
00:00:50.31 --> 00:00:54.00
I was at home, cooking, and
frying meat.
 
19
00:00:54.01 --> 00:00:56.30
And the day before,
my mother and I,
 
20
00:00:56.31 --> 00:00:58.00
had gone to the butcher shop.
 
21
00:00:58.01 --> 00:01:00.00
♫ The freezer was full
of frozen suffering, ♫
 
22
00:01:00.01 --> 00:01:03.00
♫ animal suffering.
I'm out! No way! ♫
 
23
00:01:03.01 --> 00:01:05.00
♫ Mercy for life, mercy for all. ♫
 
24
00:01:05.01 --> 00:01:09.00
And the next day, I said
that I wouldn't eat that anymore.
 
25
00:01:09.01 --> 00:01:11.00
I told my mother:
“I am going vegan.”
 
26
00:01:11.01 --> 00:01:13.30
And my mother didn't
understand what that was.
 
27
00:01:13.31 --> 00:01:17.00
I didn't even understand
because I had no reference.
 
28
00:01:17.01 --> 00:01:20.00
I just knew I didn't want
to be part of that anymore.
 
29
00:01:20.01 --> 00:01:24.00
I go to many places where
people offer me meat,
 
30
00:01:24.01 --> 00:01:25.30
even when they know I'm vegan.
 
31
00:01:25.31 --> 00:01:28.00
“Come on eat, it's just today,
it's no problem.""
 
32
00:01:28.01 --> 00:01:31.00
But veganism is not
about “just today”.
 
33
00:01:31.01 --> 00:01:34.00
Veganism is about
a concept,
 
34
00:01:34.01 --> 00:01:36.00
it’s about animal suffering.
 
35
00:01:36.01 --> 00:01:38.00
I believe veganism is about that.
 
36
00:01:38.01 --> 00:01:43.00
And “just today,” a few thousand
animals suffered. And it's not fair.
 
37
00:01:43.01 --> 00:01:45.00
So I don't agree
and if I don't agree,
 
38
00:01:45.01 --> 00:01:49.00
I don't take it into my life,
not just today, not just this minute,
 
39
00:01:49.01 --> 00:01:50.00
not just this hour.
 
40
00:01:50.01 --> 00:01:53.30
When people tell me
that veganism is expensive...
 
41
00:01:53.31 --> 00:01:56.00
Well, we need a deep breath, right?
 
42
00:01:56.01 --> 00:01:58.30
Because we know that this
person has no information.
 
43
00:01:58.31 --> 00:02:01.00
Because people who know
veganism know that
 
44
00:02:01.01 --> 00:02:06.00
veganism is possible, as well as
any form of diet.
 
45
00:02:06.01 --> 00:02:08.00
If you go to the market, at the end
of the market’s time when things are cheaper,
 
46
00:02:08.01 --> 00:02:11.00
it’s less expensive.
 
47
00:02:11.01 --> 00:02:14.30
So if you really do the math,
it’s not expensive.
 
48
00:02:14.31 --> 00:02:19.00
Unless you buy fast
foods, obviously
 
49
00:02:19.01 --> 00:02:21.00
it will be more expensive for anyone,
not just for vegans.
 
50
00:02:21.21 --> 00:02:25.00
The vegan representation
that I have is me.
 
51
00:02:25.00 --> 00:02:30.00
♫ Love and more respect to minorities, 
to black people and to the LGBTQIA+ people. ♫
 
52
00:02:30.01 --> 00:02:33.00
♫ For you who doubted,
I'm here, I'm living proof. ♫
 
53
00:02:33.01 --> 00:02:36.00
♫ I'm black, I'm proud,
I'm queen, Leyllah Diva. ♫
 
54
00:02:36.01 --> 00:02:40.00
As soon as I became a vegan,
as a drag queen,
 
55
00:02:40.01 --> 00:02:43.00
I had no other references
here in Brazil.
 
56
00:02:43.01 --> 00:02:45.30
I had to do it by myself,
following my feelings,
 
57
00:02:45.31 --> 00:02:48.00
my emotions, and the things I believe.
 
58
00:02:48.01 --> 00:02:52.00
And I think this is really great,
I think this is very important,
 
59
00:02:52.01 --> 00:02:53.30
I’m proud of this. I'm proud of being in this
drag queen universe
 
61
00:02:57.01 --> 00:03:04.00
- which is a universe of makeup,
of big looks - and of becoming an example
 
62
00:03:04.01 --> 00:03:08.50
of a universe that does not
use any animal products
 
63
00:03:08.51 --> 00:03:11.00
while also being able to bring good looks.
 
64
00:03:11.01 --> 00:03:13.00
I want to bring this,
I want to be that example
 
65
00:03:13.01 --> 00:03:17.00
for other generations of drag
queens who are here in Brazil.
 
66
00:03:17.01 --> 00:03:20.30
I believe that we
have to be the example
 
67
00:03:20.31 --> 00:03:23.00
of what we want
to change in the world.
 
68
00:03:23.01 --> 00:03:26.00
It's pointless trying to 
force someone to be vegan,
 
69
00:03:23.01 --> 00:03:31.00
or tell them that they need to wear 
a specific kind of piece,
 
70
00:03:30.01 --> 00:03:31.50
if I don't do it.
 
71
00:03:31.51 --> 00:03:36.00
So I have been
the way I am.
 
72
00:03:36.01 --> 00:03:38.00
And it affects people
around us, because
 
73
00:03:38.01 --> 00:03:43.00
they see it's possible 
to live a life  without the consumption of meat, milk,
or any animal products.
 
75
00:03:49.01 --> 00:03:52.00
It's amazing, to deconstruct.
 
76
00:03:52.01 --> 00:03:55.30
And show to other people
of our family, of other relations,
 
77
00:03:55.31 --> 00:03:59.00
friends, that it is possible to
have a healthy life,
 
78
00:03:59.01 --> 00:04:02.00
a life without animal suffering.
 
79
00:04:02.01 --> 00:04:02.59
That's it.

Who looked at the damage each sector farming does to the environment. Now we know there's no way to farm without causing some environmental issues. But we all want to reduce our impact, right? So there is actually something of the planet left for future generations. And the bit I want to tell you about",1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekPovoHbbMM,Science Doesn't Lie: Plant-Based Foods Will Save The Climate,Generation Vegan,1 Dec 2019,0:23,"is how the production of certain foods impacts climate change. This abacus shows how many pounds of greenhouse gases are created for every 100 grams of protein. And since different methods of farming create differing amounts of greenhouse gases. I'm going to show you the range for each. Okay, so let's start with beef. Depending on the method of production, beef produces between 231 pounds and 44 pounds",2

That is bad news for the planet. Now we come to farm crustaceans. That's crabs, shrimps and lobsters. And hundreds of billions of them are farmed each year. Their production creates at the high end 77 pounds of greenhouse gases for every 100 grams of protein achieved. And at the low end 11 pounds. For lamb and mutton the range is between 60 and 26 pounds.",3

Then there is cheese, that's between 40 and 11 pounds. While pig meat creates between 31 pounds and 10 pounds of climate changing omissions for every 100 grams of protein.

But this is where it gets interesting. Let's look at plant foods. Tofu, it creates just eight to 2.2 pounds of climate changing gases per 100 grams of protein obtained. So this a great replacement for meat. Nut trees actually take a lot of the CO2 out of the atmosphere, so they have a net benefit, which is why their range is from 5.3 to negative 4.8.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,2:08,that much of it did shock me back then I have terrible memories of some of the things that we had to do when I was a kid growing up and then for a long time I buried all of that I I didn't let it bother me anymore like like so many trauma survivors you learn to put it away and not dwell on it and forget about it as best you can but then later in life as I begin to get involved in animal activism it all came rushing back and and I know describe some of those incidents uh which we may talk about later in the program but so somehow back in the 70s I started working with an animal group and one of them suggested that we should look into factory farming which was not known about yet none of the animal groups in the United States had any knowledge of farmed Animal Welfare issues none of them had a program and my boss Alice Harrington Friends of Animals said let's look into factory,3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,3:12,farming so I did and then I met Peter Singer and together we agreed to write animal factories which came out in 1980 and it was really at least the United States of course you had Ruth Harrison's animal machines but we had nothing like that so Peter's in my book and his book animal Liberation where the first books to really show factory farming to American audiences and made quite a hit it uh made a lot of people angry and I think it really sort of um to boils so to speak on what happens with farm animals and uh then the book came out again in 1990 so factory farming was there to see for all and I think the strength of the book when it came out was the photographs that we had we had Vivid black and white photographs of the Interiors of factory farms so that really was shocking,4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,4:12,thanks Jim and yeah do you want to talk about why you felt compelled to write an unnatural order yes in the wake of writing animal factories once it came out I kept really being obsessed with the thought of farm animals where did they come from were they wild animals I mean I just didn't understand that there was a domestication process so in the early 1980s I was reading everything I could get my hands on about the history of domestication and it led to dozens of books which if you've done any research every book leads you to dozens of more books and then I was so lucky in the 70s because I knew some radical feminists and where I was living in Connecticut at the time and they were lesbian separatists they were quite radical and very politically active and they had a vegetarian restaurant and one of the leaders the founder of Selma was a buddy of mine and she every time I'd go there for lunch or dinner she'd stick a book in my face and she'd,5

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,6:21,knew enough to sit down and write the book that became an unnatural order so there it is yeah thanks I mean yeah like I said you can really see the level of research that's gone into it um I guess for anyone in the audience who hasn't read the book can you like briefly say what do you see as what does like most of society view as the natural order and what do you and many other people view as the natural order just to give this a bit of context before we go deeper I think the natural order was the way it was before agriculture what we call forager Society sometimes called hunter-gatherer society and that's the longest part of human existence that's the thousands and hundreds of thousands of years before we settle down to live in in villages and race crops and and manipulate animal sex lives so that's the natural order of things that's what we were brought up on as a species then we started farming,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,7:23,and that meant settling down living in cities having hierarchies having governments taxes rules regulations and a lot of social conflict especially in the form of War so that's the unnatural order that's not what we were brought up to do and in the course of living like that of course we had to make a break with the past which is why the ancient herberries if if you read the Bible lately it tells it how they had to destroy the idols the graven images which represented the old religions where we used to not worship but be in awe of the powers of nature that and felt a kinship with other animals that's Financial order yeah and you'll put that too kind of exposes how the when you talk about hunter-gatherer culture like the hunter aspect of it has kind of been exaggerated and really we were more gatherers about me as a species yes it has because it's been written mostly by men,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,8:27,let's face it early anthropology was a male Hobby and a hobby of Rich privileged males and of course they all love to hunt so whenever they looked at the past they tended to see things through their own lens let me show you a book that um I don't know if you can see the title but it's called The Way of the animal Powers it's by Joseph Campbell and it really explains what life and culture was like before agriculture when we lived in an era where animals were important not so much as meat and and Laboratory subjects but kinship Ken fellas that's a great segue to my next question Jim which is how were or so are other animals important to us as humans like how and why though this is the most important idea and one I think we agreed to talk about the most because it's very it's little,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,9:33,known not too many people understand what we mean when we say the animal Powers which is a shorthand for the way we regarded animals other animals in the living world before we became farmers I want to read a passage from a book by a writer Henry beston this is from his book The outermost house and this is the way uh this is the way he describes animals animals he says he writes in a world more complete than ours they move finished and complete gifted with extensions of the senses we have lost or never attained living by Voices we shall never hear they're not Brethren they are not underlings they are other nations cut with ourselves in the net of life and time fellow prisoners of the Splendor and the travail of earth oh my god of course I've choking up reading this because,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,10:37,it's such a good way to describe how we used to regard animals and we need to recover that yeah yeah we really do um are you able to talk a bit kind of briefly about how animals really were held up um yeah in kind of human culture before they're kind of fall as it were well some good examples of the importance or the power of animals on human mind and Consciousness before agriculture good examples one is the famous cave paintings which everyone's heard about in the caves of France and Spain these are probably painted 20 some 30 000 years ago when we were still forger people living mostly Outdoors living with animals and animals moved us because they were so impressive those cave paintings are very important here's what your lord Kenneth Clark has to say about,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,11:38,those paintings which again says a lot about how animals were important to the human mind before agriculture Clark says this personally I believe that the animals and the cave paintings are records of admiration the painters are saying quote this is what we want to be like these are the most admirable of our Kinsmen they've felt kinship of the other animals they were impressed by the power of animals by the Beauty and the grace of animals don't forget people were living mostly Outdoors at that time they heard animal sounds throughout the day and night they saw animals in action they saw animals doing all the things that were familiar to us and the Vivid things things the body chasing other animals uh hiding in the shade getting a drink in the in the,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,12:38,pool eating something having sex with each other uh anything that humans could identify with so this observation these observations puzzled that early human mind and made people wonder what are they who are they who are we it gave them a sense of reference to the natural world and a very important thing a sense of belonging to the Earth and when we became farmers and agriculturalists when we learned to take power over other animals in the natural forces that's when we began to feel like separate from nature separate from not a part of nature in fact to this day people deny that we are animals they don't like to think about it so this is what I said in the book this broke this agriculture changed the way we think about life and the world view and it broke what I call the Primal Bond with the Living World which was a sense of familiarity of kinship of belonging,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,13:50,in life here and in your book you actually use the term like oh animal cousins and it's really that sense of like a bigger wider family um and it's yeah can you describe like what does kinship mean to you yes it it helps to know a little bit about Evolution uh you know we are descended from a common ancestor with chimpanzees and the other apes and that occurred about seven million years ago and for the first several million of those years we live pretty much like just another animal Outdoors no clothing no shelter no fire yet we were like one of the Apes and the thing that distinguished us from the other Apes that that where we branched off was we walked on our hind legs we became bipedal which enabled us to leave the forest and the jungles and live out in the open and the other thing which is often lost when you read,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,14:52,anthropology the other distinguishing thing about this new breed this new genus of hominin was it had a a better brain a better awareness cognitive ability ability to think and the thing that stands out for me was this animal had measurably more the sense of curiosity about the world it was a very curious ape and millions of years go by and then we become modern humans they think about 200 000 years ago when we become cultural humans and all this time we've been impressed with the animals around us so no wonder when we went to shelter in the caves we would paint pictures of animals and the other big proof of the importance of animals if you read about what they call and spouses called creation stories every tribal people has a story of how they came to be like the Lakota people or the Comanche people or,15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,15:59,some other tribal people uh almost all of these stories the way they explained the beginning of the world is that animals were here first and then humans came along and the Animals taught us how to build fire how to find food how to live so that shows again the importance in creation Stories the importance of animals the the creation stories anthropologists say the most important myth of any culture because it sets out the basic worldview of that culture so it's kind of striking that almost all of the creation stories have the world beginning with animals teaching us how to live yeah yeah and um yeah I mean what really came across like for me and reading your book is that kind of like war and reverence we always had for other animals and I love how you also show how we still have that like it's obviously been warped and fragmented but we still have that in our,16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,17:02,culture in our society and you even mentioned how like in nurseries and you know with children especially is that like you have a sense of belonging and curiosity about other animals it's impossible to lose isn't it most of the intellectuals of the 20th century that I've read all talk about what they call man man's alienation from nature and it's considered to be a basic problem with the modern the modern lifestyle alienation from nature if you know the Frankfurt School Max horkheimer Eric Fromm Walter Benjamin all of them wrote about alienation from nature and that's what happened that was caused by breaking the Primal bonds with the living world breaking off kinship to see ourselves as a separate creature not an animal a human being and that you know went downhill from there in my view yeah yeah I mean you've,17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,18:04,kind of you've made that reference before like about how animals yeah were held up with gods and then obviously they're not really seen as good as society and obviously this is a big chunk of what the book is about and like there's so much to it but just if you can kind of give a brief summary for anyone who hasn't read about read the book about that kind of fall from them animals other animals as Gods to to goods and how that came about through agrarians that is okay so once I understood this idea of the animal powers how important they were to the human consciousness and culture and mind and language I began to think oh my God what did this do to us when we enslaved animals when we took power over them when we castrated them separated them by sex manipulated every aspect of their lives took them out of their natural habitat put them in pens and and stables and and took power over,18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,19:05,them so I thought that probably was a great blow to the way humans lived and several other intellectuals have said the same thing like there's a famous writer Jared Diamond I don't know if you know his work but he wrote a famous essay uh oh about 10 or 15 years ago that caused a bit of a stink he wrote it for a popular magazine he said I think the title of the essay was agriculture the biggest mistake in the history of the human human race and that was my thinking exactly oh my God that's where we first went wrong was breaking off our sense of belonging with the world and so that's really what my book is about it's about the Fallout or the repercussions of taking control over the lives of animals and taking them out of their natural habitat and making them captive slaves for meat milk hides leather all of the,19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,20:10,things yeah and and you know a lot is is about 100 environmental harm that of exploiting animals and obviously the harm to human house as well and also the harm directly caused to animals but and this is something that your book really goes into when you've kind of referenced her as well can you go in more detail about what you see as the Deep psychological harm that has caused us and other animals and our relationship well I think the first and the most obvious and the most direct uh byproduct of animal enslavement was a patriarchy a lot of people have trouble understanding that we didn't understand how the sex act produced pregnancy and the birth of babies before agriculture before animal husbandry this was a woman's mystery and it gave women quite a bit of status and power within the,20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,21:11,group within the tribe and the in the immediate family women could do things that men could not women would bleed monthly and yet they did not die and blood was extremely important and powerful and that day and it wasn't understood that the pregnancy was in any way related to a man's activities the sex act but wants to begin to cat and keep animals captive and manipulate them which had to do with manipulating their sex lives separating males from females and living among the same animals over time they began to understand that the male goat or sheep mounts the female and makes it pregnant and babies are born so this really busted up The Mystery of the female powers and all of a sudden women were not considered as important as before they lost their power so patriarchy begins and if you,21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,22:09,know anything about the anthropology of the nomadic herds people they're very male dominant it's a it's kind of a male culture and we get this of course we get pieces of it in the Bible the lifestyles of the uh the ancient Hebrews but they were just one of many all of the other people in the ancient Middle East that that hurted were herders of sheep and goats and cattle had the same kind of patriarchal structures it was a male dominant Society males control the animals which was the wealth so patriarchy begins and women begin to be demoted through misogyny which is the change the belief women were no longer mysterious and Powerful women or slaves now and their slaves primarily for sexual purposes for recreational sex in the form of their slave girls and their concubines and also for the family wealth in the form of more children than the patriarchal family so it was a big,22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,23:13,link between the herds people and their control of animals and the busting up of the old views of women and sex and male roles so that's one link and if you want to go on about this I think another link is when we begin to take power over nature and began to be full of ourselves and the controlling of the rivers clearing forests for cropland controlling animals we began to have a kind of a contempt for the natural world that it was not under our control yet the agriculturalists sees uncultivated land as wild and crazy and needing to be controlled in fact the the word Wilderness if you're familiar Wilderness comes from Old English and it was three words in Old English willed day or Ness which is literally the place of the wild beasts they feared the Wilderness the Wilderness was awful to them and they,23

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,27:36,that which I elaborate on more in a book is it makes us pretty squeamish about things about our bodies and our sexuality and our bodily functions we tend to hide those because and to be embarrassed by them because they remind us of our animal state I don't know if you've read about how women upper class women in the 19th century had to hide breastfeeding and they usually farmed it out to a wet nurse because it was considered embarrassing to nurse your baby because that reminded you of being an animal a mammal and the other thing of course hiding bodily functions which we do in the bathroom anything that reminds us of our animal state and nudity and so forth yeah and we can still see that in current yeah culture so much can't we um yeah kind of touching upon what you've already said about um kind of that link between animal oppression and other oppressions and,27
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,28:41,kind of colonialism as well and capitalism like how do you see them all as like entangled and do you see that we can kind of address any of these in isolation or do we really need to be thinking of this as like one whole kind of Oppression that manifests in different ways yeah it's pretty hard to get the the depth and the complexity of this across I think the feminists are most likely to see it in fact many of my feminist friends have actually I totally turned me on to the books about how patriarchy begins with sheep and goat hurting people in the Middle East so there's an obvious link there the rest of it is kind of hard to get across but there is a development in Academia now which I'm sure you have over there as well it's called intersectionality where people activists in the various forms of Oppression whether it's on racism or uh sexism misogyny or trying to show the intersection of forms of Oppression and,28
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,29:44,I'm trying to help them understand that there is a common route in the early centuries or Millennia of Agriculture much has been written about the impacts of Agriculture as I told you the greatest mistake in the history of the human race most of that the elaborates on plant agriculture the ancient Sumerians and our fields of grain and their trade in Grain and their shipping of grain and how it made Rome wealthy but very little is said about the animal side of that I don't read a lot about the impacts of animal Agriculture and I think that's what we need to do and the time is ripe too because now with climate crisis there's a lot more talk about the impacts of animal agriculture on climate problems that's uh recent I didn't hear that 20 years ago well some are saying it 20 or 30 years ago when we weren't listening but today they're saying that animal agriculture is one of the major,29
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,30:46,contributors to The Climate crisis and I think that we want to show that agriculture animal agriculture has affected not only the earth and the land and the waters and so much consumption and the cruelty involved but how it has affected our culture and then connecting that to patriarchy and slavery and racism and colonialism so there's a lot to connect there when we can get some understanding of the intersectionality of these other kinds of Oppression but the common root historically I think we'll make some progress I think we can do that yeah yeah um so how kind of best kind of building on what you said do you think we as a movement communicate to other Freedom movements that actually we're part of the same struggle and we're working towards the same vision yes we have something to overcome they they tender the others I was a part of a leftist,30

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,33:57,yeah kind of come for yourself and kind of regain a sense of kinship with other animals okay that's a good one I see a lot of this now when I do social media and I see the clips on Tick Tock and Instagram and Twitter and all these social media that a lot of people are showing video clips of animals doing I call them heart warming heartwarming things where like a baby lion is cuddling with the dog or a kitten showing animals playing together animals jumping and running and doing wonderful things that we love to see in animals and these are so heartwarming to me because it shows that animals love to play that animals feel Joy animals feel a kind of a kinship of each other in playing and eating together and doing nice things that we can't even seem to do as human beings so I would think that those seem like some of those little Clips are kind,33
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,34:59,of silly to some people but they do tell us a lot and uh they come up on us daily when I see such a clip of uh a young woman who had brought up a baby donkey that she had rescued and after many years of course a donkey went to the sanctuary and she grew up as a college kid and she came back this donkey ran ran to her and nuzzled her and was like I recognize you I see you I smell you you're my friend and if we could show more of that kind of thing oh my God it says so much more than showing us terrible pictures of horror and Gordon cruelty which I think uh have a place if they're educational but if we would show more of this commonality and behavior this,34

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,37:05,agreement and German yeah you just said what's kind of touched upon silicon at the end of your book you you say you see Society our culture coming full circle can you expand on that a bit more before we um yes it's happening uh oddly enough to see perhaps seems ironic that it's happening because of science which has always been our enemy because of experimentation on animals so animal people tend to have a kind of a not a kind of a dark view of science but science has brought some reality to our worldview and you know we have to know that we are animals we are mammals we have so much in common with animals and our nervous system in our anatomy our physiology all of that has been brought to more common knowledge now than ever so I think that is a basis for a sense of kinship that's both emotional and cultural and now scientific,36
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,38:11,um we can kind of prove kinship what is the what are the numbers on the DNA that we have in common with chimpanzees it's like 98 points something or rather that we have the same genetic material as a chimp so we could probably and it's in order thought to some people we could probably interbreed with chimpanzees and produce hybrid animals as Horses breed with donkeys and produce mules and other kinds of hybrids not that we want to do that that's not to be done but we're so close to our common ancestors and our common um uh kin folks um yeah that's probably a terrible example and this turns people off but we are very close to animals and we understand that from the scientific knowledge that has come to us in the past Century about how how much like animals we are and I think that it's a good thing to explore that to understand that and for animal people that are kind,37

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,44:34,me I ah I think there's a lot of more power and intensity in the emotional connection with animals that is the push-up yeah that's the perfect answer Gemma is like we know don't we feel it um had a great question from Nancy she said in your book and our natural order you go more into how hunting by men was a way of men compensating for the powers of women and being able to reproduce new humans and this involved violence and cousins of animals and was the beginning of men's dominance over women because only men who were stronger hunted and brought home food I.E carcasses so and Nancy's asking would you talk a bit more about the beginnings of patriarchy and hunting um than herding that's true there's a there's a some anthropology that the hunting the cultures that depended on hunting and this would have been,43
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,45:36,the peoples who were pushed into uninhabitable and poorly habitable ecosystems desert ecosystems and the cold North Siberia and North America where you couldn't really uh forage for plant life because of the climate so they had to turn to hunting they were squeezed into those regions because of the crowding caused by agriculture for example the Inuit people pushed into the polar regions in Siberia they've only been there for five or six thousand years they haven't been there for hundreds of thousands of years the pressure of agricultural expansion pushed a lot of people into these marginal zones where hunting was about the only way to get food and they tended to be male dominated because men probably sought to kill animals and I suggested in my book it sounds like a stretch to a lot of people that the hunt was more for power than protein,44
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,46:35,that they needed to eat animals because there wasn't any other kind of food out there and it kind of fell to them in to see this as a way well if we bring in powerful animals you know will enhance our Prestige with a family group we'll be seen as doing something important now a lot of people sort of titter and giggle about this but think about it if those people saw animals as powerful as having special powers in fact in totemic society some animals were considered the the ancestors of the tribe and there was a strong relationship and they had to ask permission to that leader of the animals that would have been maybe the great elk of the great Buffalo or some other powerful animal that they were going to go out and kill and bring in to impress the family they had to ask for permission they had to go through elaborate rituals and these were the male hunt clubs the male hunt groups that would do this before a hunt they had to do all kinds,45
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,47:43,of rituals to bless their weapons one anthropologists said that it would not like women anywhere near the weapons that they were going to use in the hunt because the female power might affect the male power and their weapons to kill the animal there's a lot going on there between views of men and women and killing animals and animal Powers so I I suggested in the book and it wasn't exactly tongue-in-cheek that maybe those Hunters went out more for power than for protein yeah thanks Jim um Victoria has asked the question when you talk about people turning away from imagery of war and suffering of other animals do you think there is a place for um for these types of visuals in the modern animal rights movement or should we stop documenting the harms we do to animals and focus on the positive stories instead oh yeah it's uh I don't know I always think that uh when,46
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,48:44,you show images that turn people away you know are going to lose their attention uh I know we have to do that because we have to document what factory farming does to animals specifically pigs and in the case of dairy the tearing of the calf away from the mother these are the realities of what's wrong with that and I know we have to show that but I've been told that you don't want to show some really cruel off-putting images unless you can follow that with some positivity unless you can make it a teaching moment so that you don't just get them to turn the channel and then go on to some ball game or something if you are going to show the cruelty to the pig or the dairy cow You're Gonna Go quickly from that to something that we can do about it in a positive way so yeah I'm not ruling out showing painful imagery I'm just saying we've got to use it properly because uh,47
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,49:51,you know a steady diet of a Gore is not going to attract many viewers yeah and I guess it's kind of showing that contrast between the nightmare the reality and the dream like how things should be or kinship with other animals and that can be quite powerful so yeah yeah I hear what you're saying and gym um Nancy's come back with another question um wasn't hunting before um agriculture as Nancy's pet agriculture um for example 40 to 70 000 years ago when humans were curious and wandered too far north when it was cold and not as late as animal agriculture around 10 000 dudes ago yeah it's uh a lot of anthropology to look into there I got a whole section in my book about the the um exaggeration of the role of hunting and Primitives excuse me societies one of the things that biases built into anthropology,48
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52d5cJZBZo,"In Conversation with Jim Mason, author of: An Unnatural Order",Animal Think Tank,8 Sept 2023,50:53,Because by the time there was a real science of anthropology in 19 early 1900s and 20s and 30s and they looked to find examples of what we used to call primitive societies that is pre-agricultural peoples the only people that were left were the peoples and the uninhabitable ecosystems deserts in the far north so when anthropology starts looking for so-called I call them Primal cultures hunter-gatherer forager people the only ones left I think I gave the numbers in the book the most of the the societies they looked at some two or three hundred most of them were in Northern North America and in Siberia so of course they're going to be hunting cultures so then the anthropologists come home back to the office and they write about primitive cultures being Hunters because all of the plant-based 400 people had been wiped out,49

That was when I had that ""aha!"" moment, that the kids were the primary reason for us getting clean with our diet.

Not only mentally you could see them deteriorating, but physically they were deteriorating. And when you look at their food diary, you would see what they were eating, predominantly animal products and processed foods, they weren't really eating much plant matter at all. So they weren't eating high volumes of fruits and vegetables,",3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNenwkTOumI,Celebrity Coach And Nutritionist Shares His Wisdom,Generation Vegan,25 Nov 2019,0:57,"they weren't eating whole grains. Very rarely were they eating nuts and seeds or sweet potatoes and things like that. And as I started changing their diets, not only did they start losing weight, but their energy started increasing, they start feeling better and they start looking better. And as they would keep coming back to me, we'd start seeing, because they'd been going to a physician, their blood pressure is going down",4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNenwkTOumI,Celebrity Coach And Nutritionist Shares His Wisdom,Generation Vegan,25 Nov 2019,1:17,"and their cardiovascular markers were improving and everything so it was pretty fascinating how well I was seeing results with clients with plant-based eating. I would fine-tune clients even more, so we'd get clients that would be dropping 150 pounds in a year. People would have blood sugar of 600 and start going back to, now 125, reversing heart disease, diabetes would go away.",5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNenwkTOumI,Celebrity Coach And Nutritionist Shares His Wisdom,Generation Vegan,25 Nov 2019,1:40,"It was amazing. Kids with attention deficit, hyperactivity, violence, all of a sudden changed their diet, then I start changing their lifestyle and boom. Kids would pop back to normal, as if they were normal again. And people would run up to their parents saying, ""What medication is your child on?"" And they'd say, ""No, we just changed his diet and his lifestyle."" So one of the main things that we need to do",6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNenwkTOumI,Celebrity Coach And Nutritionist Shares His Wisdom,Generation Vegan,25 Nov 2019,2:00,"is we need to increase the volume of vegetation. So we need to increase the volume of fresh fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables are basically the highest levels of antioxidants we can get, other than, say maybe spices or essential oils, but what we normally find in our daily life are fruits and vegetables. So the more fresh fruits and vegetables that you consume, the more antioxidants you consume",7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNenwkTOumI,Celebrity Coach And Nutritionist Shares His Wisdom,Generation Vegan,25 Nov 2019,2:20,"and that prevents premature aging. Those are kinda like your internal bodyguards, they're protecting you against stress and pollution and damage that might be occurring in the day. And for most people they're not occurring at a normal rate, they're at accelerated rate, and so the average person, maybe 90, 92 or more of their diet is animal products and processed foods. Not only do those foods not have antioxidants,",8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNenwkTOumI,Celebrity Coach And Nutritionist Shares His Wisdom,Generation Vegan,25 Nov 2019,2:42,"but they have pro-oxidants, so they're causing you to actually prematurely age. So by adding fresh fruits and vegetables into your diet, you can slow down the aging process for sure and the easiest way to do it, aside from eating more fresh fruits and vegetables, is have a smoothie. Just basically get a non-dairy milk, put it in a blender, put some organic frozen blueberries in there, right,",9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNenwkTOumI,Celebrity Coach And Nutritionist Shares His Wisdom,Generation Vegan,25 Nov 2019,3:02,"put in some kale or any green that you like, and maybe put in another sweet fruit like mangoes or whatever it is you like, blend it up and you're good to go. You're eating more fresh fruits and vegetables in one serving of that than a lot of people eat in an entire week. It's not uncommon to have a client lose 150 pounds in a little over a year. So these are pure blown food addicts.",10

When you're looking at processed foods, those are definitely, you're ringing the bell in the brain with the processed foods, and it's very similar to drugs. But after a while you adapt, you neuro-adapt, and it's the same thing with your diet. You're running on this super high all the time. Either you're super excited with caffeine,",11

So it's one or the other. Once you start getting healthy and you start neuro-adapting, your body starts regulating to a different speed, so you're not functioning at this high speed all the time, and you're okay to be here, that appears to be normal for you now. So when I work with clients,",12

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,0:00,hi everyone thanks for joining I'm just going to share my screen um great to see so many faces here so this session is going to be talking about how at animal think tank we really think uh having a narrative strategy can help us as a movement win animal Freedom so I'm sure everyone feels that um you know trying to even achieve animal freedom feels like a really massive uphill struggle and often the whole world feels against us but at animal think tank we take a lot of inspiration from other social movements so a big part of our research is not just public opinion research it's also researching other social justice movements and you know in my role it's like really learning from The Narrative strategies what worked what didn't work so lots for us to learn from be inspired by and even though obviously we're a unique movement we're an ally movement there's definitely lots of lessons that we can take from other movements so when I talk about narrative strategy what does that even mean very simply it,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,1:06,means changing the ideas that we live by both individually and as a society so I'm going to be looking today at three movements and campaigns in particular and their success stories and the reason why I'm focusing on these ones is they were really intentional about narrative strategy doing public opinion research and pivoting where needed so I think there's a lot for us to learn as a movement so the first campaign I'm going to be focused on is the truth Campaign which was a is still ongoing in the US which is focused on um encouraging teenagers to stop smoking to quit smoking so it's basically an anti- tobacco campaign so in 2000 22.6% of Youth in the US smoked and by 2021 only 2.3% smoked and this is in big part to the Truth camp and obviously during that time vaping did come in so this is part of the reason for the decline but V vaping also declined in that time so um,2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,2:12,in I think it was 2019 it was 18.1% and in just two years it went down by to 13.3% so both smoking and vaping declined in this period and many people attribute it to the great work of the truth campaign so how did they achiev that massive decline well firstly they really spent time uh speaking to their target audience and they found out what mattered most to them and they found that one of their key aspirational identities of teenagers in America was to be seen as cor and rebellious particularly by their peers and the tobacco industry really already understood its audience and it had been targeting their aspirational identities and tapping into that for a really really long,3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,3:16,time but and this kind of narrative strategy of the tobacco industry of big tobacco has really influenced pop culture so you know seeing icons smoking and this is just really infused throughout pop culture over decades because a brilliant narrative strategy by the tobacco industry but these are what standard anti-tobacco ad tactics look like and it's often resorting to things like shock and disgust and fear um these can be effective all of those things do have a place but to a degree and they're probably only effective on certain people as well and the truth truth campaign did Ed some Shock tactics but it did so really sparingly and it made sure that it still did this while speaking in teenagers language so you know it very much use this framing of take control and they also very intentionally,4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,4:17,used humor and light-heartedness in their ads which is quite unusual for anti- tobacco ads and really kind of yeah channeled these emotions and connected with their young audience in kind of Innovative and fresh ways the truth campaign did use facts again quite sparingly and it made sure that it made these facts relevant and relatable to their target audience the the truth campaign also knew that emotions values identities and stories are much more persuasive than facts facts definitely have their place but it really is emotions and values these aspirational identities and stories that can really help connect with people and help shift narratives those big ideas that we live by over time so the truth campaign was really really effective at reframing cor and rebellious that really aspirational identity of teenagers as it not being about not smoking that was what was,5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,5:19,called un rebellious and they tapped into this and used a clear call to action so another key aspirational identity of um teenagers in America was to be seen as empowered and independent and the truth campaign through its very name framed itself as truthful which automatically framed big tobacco as deceitful and a lot of their campaigning was about exposing industry tactics and framing kind of big taco as the enemy and really trying to shame them into changing rather than focusing just on individuals shaming them into changing about shaming the industry and forcing them to change and exposing their tactics underhand tactics and showing how they profiled teenages and particularly um black communities as well so the truth campaign was very careful about framing teenagers who,6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,6:17,didn't smoke as smart as independent and really as change makers so really again tapping into those aspirational identities and connecting with What mattered to teenagers and they framed individual changes empowering but also this wasn't just about individual change this is about Collective change they use this framing of we can be the generation that ends smoking so it's really that feeling of being part of something bigger about being part of social progress and obviously social progress is a narrative that all social justice movements do use very effectively and the other great thing that the truth campaign did was it created a sense of a unified us and they use language like this is about us together and they also shared lots of Journey stories of really relatable trusted Messengers so people who talked about why they um stopped smoking how their views had changed and this is really they used a lot of different diverse messenges that made sure that that it engaged with a variety of um kind of,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,7:20,demographics and psychographics within the US team population and they were also really strategic in in connecting with certain interests of the uh us uh youth community and you know particularly Gamers so really kind of channeling what was important to certain teenagers and they also connected with their concerns so concerns such as mental health concerns about the environment and linking how tobacco was um destroying the environment and also really linking it with this is a social justice concern this isn't an individual choices isn't something about lifestyle this really is a social justice concern so why did the truth campaign work why was it so effective I think a lot of it is down to this idea of aspirational identities and really connecting finding that sweet spot between what matters to individuals what is their aspirational identity and what is the wider cultural identity,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,8:25,what's that overlap between how teenagers perceive themselves and how they want to be perceived by others and the rest of society and also the truth campaign was very strategic in finding that sweet spot finding that overlap about how they frame themselves as a campaign and as a movement and overlapping with their target audience and with the wider culture as well the tree campaign was really great at showing not telling its audience so it didn't tell teenagers not to smoke it really helped them Reach that decision by themselves they were they sided these kind of messaging pitfalls such as these like vaping is not corol or smoking is not cool and as linguist George Lov says activating a frame even when rejecting it strengthens the frame so unintentionally ads like this actually kind of give free air time and free marketing to The Vaping industry because people have to activate a frame that,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,9:25,vaping is called to uh negate it and the other strategic thing about the truth campaign was they pivoted when they needed to so they continued doing public opinion research so inter interviews focus groups polling surveys to really find out how these communications were Landing with their target audience as the years went by so in 1998 to 2014 their focus was really about framing the industry as the enemy like it was about framing teenagers as protesting against industry manipulation but if we go back to that graph again you can kind of see in the middle that kind of communication starts losing traction and it starts Plateau so they were very quick to yeah try and figure out why that was happening why this kind of this framing this narrative strategy was no longer having the traction that had done previously so they pivoted in 2014 and,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,10:28,this is still um yeah as I said they're still communicating this is still an ongoing campaign and they use this framing of finish it and it again it was this idea that we can be the generation to end smoking so it was about positive Collective action and really driving social change it wasn't so much kind of a negative focusing on the industry it was much more on the positive on this aspirational shared identity of teenagers so how can we apply these lessons from the truth campaign to our movement again I think one of the big takeaways is really thinking about what are the aspirational identities that we want to tap into when we're communicating what are the individual identities that really resonate for different groups of people and obviously it's not going to be the same identity for everyone but are there kind of more resonant identities that do track across what is the cultural identity what's that kind of aspiration how do we see the UK or the US wherever we're situated,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,11:31,how do people view Society how do they want to view it and how do we frame ourselves either in our campaigns or as a movement as a whole how do we find that sweet spot that overlap where we can really get strategic and think about the big ideas that we live by and how we can change those so people can think about this issue in new ways so some of these identities could be vegan um it's definitely become it's being seen as more aspirational but is it the right um aspirational identity for enough people is it something like animal lover is you know the UK or I'm sure many other uh cultures and countries is it this idea of being a nation of animal lovers does that connect with people what are the shared values that connect with different people so this is a lot of ongoing research for us animal think tank but I know there's uh other organizations already looking at this too so it is really as a movement kind of looking through this lens how do we connect with how people see themselves and want to see themselves and how can that motivate,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,12:33,them to live up to those aspirations so another takeaway is being mindful of the images that we use um I think as a movement we're very good at showcasing the problem the nightmare of um animals being oppressed and obviously that doesn't need to be ried but also bearing in mind how that lands with our audience and if people are just seeing kind of graph horrifying um imagery does it bring them in or does it turn them away and often that is you know dependent on where people are in their Journey but as a movement could we be using humor and light-heartedness more too just like the truth campaign did to connect with different audiences with different segments and takeaway three uh is really about it could be about framing the industry as deceitful so we've done early research on this and we have found it as persuasive we're doing more research to kind of test different frames of this but I think it's important um our movement is different obviously big tobacco um yeah,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,13:40,it it wants to get people addicted to nicotine whereas farming obviously is about feeding people so I think we need to be careful around enemy Framing and you know expose what uh areas of the industry are doing show how that is deceitful but also really frame the industry as being able to change and I think what is really key is also showing you know many farmers many kind of different aspects of the industry that already is changing to really convey the changes possible to people um and it's really about framing individual change as empowering that this isn't about what we have to give up that this is really about us kind of living in line with our values and also that this isn't just about individual change because that can feel overwhelming and it can feel like you're not really kind of making a difference just you by yourself but this really being framed as part of a collective change that this is about social progress so again this is testing that we're doing animal Think Tank uh ongoing testing so the next movement I want to,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,14:42,talk about the next campaign is the freedom to marry campaign I'm sure many of you have heard us talk about freedom to marry and we think tank before because it is a really big inspiration for us and I think um I personally I read about it lots because I think I always take something else away from this movement because there's so much depth and richness to it so campaigners were told by a really respected us poster that they would never see gay marriage in their lifetime because they had been campaigning for this and in the polls there was just not really much movement at all in US population they were just against the idea of gay marriage but within about 11 or 12 years they had won marriage equality within all 50 states in the US so how did they achieve this phenomenal fee again like the truth campaign they really took the time to speak with the conflicted middle so the people that really toggle between agreeing with some aspects around G marriage but also,15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,15:45,having fears and anxieties and disagreeing with other aspects so they really focused on the people who were ambivalent rather than the people who were already in agreement or people who were definitely opposed and they really spent time through figuring out what were their barriers and concerns to this issue and interestingly they found that some of those barriers were how the movement and the campaign had been communicated so they pivoted they realized that this framing that they had been using around rights and Justice um people kind of these are abstract terms that don't really mean much to people when people think about marriage they're not thinking about rights and Justice and they're definitely not thinking about tax breaks but tax rakes was something they did use in some of their Communications to kind of convey this sense of um there should be equ quality that everyone should get tax breaks and you know gay couples shouldn't miss out on that so they they pivoted from doing this research and they realized they actually needed to communicate what why marriage mattered why marriage was,16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,16:49,important to the gay community and it was the same reason that it's important to everyone it's shared values like family like love like equality and also so you know a core value of America and also many uh countries is this value of Freedom that everyone should have the freedom to marry so you see in their logo as well these values represented here in the kind of icon of the house the family the heart for love and the equal sign for equality so people were kind of being exposed to these values over and over even just seeing the icon another great strategy of uh freedom to marry was making this into a societal issue and again they realized that their own Communications had been uh kind of limiting and hindering how people connected with the issue so they have been framing it as about gay marriage and when they did research with people they realized that this very much framed it as a niche issue something that only affected a small section of us,17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,17:51,society and people were like well this doesn't affect me I don't really have an opinion on this so they pivoted and and just this small word shift this small language shift from gay marriage to marriage equality actually really opened up the issue because equality again is a value that is very important to America and this was about everyone having equal opportunity to marry this wasn't just about gay people this was about marriage equality in the US and another great strategy of um freedom to marry is they framed this as a win for everyone that every one benefited this wasn't just a win for the gay community this was a win for love this was a win for America and again you see this in the the white red and blue that they used over and over in their messaging this was always a win for America not just for the gay community also strategic um was their use of Journey stories so very much like how the truth campaign used Journey stories of um people who were relatable,18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,18:55,to their target audience uh freedom to also spent time researching who would be trusted Messengers and really researching what would be kind of strategic stories that would help shift people's thinking around this issue so they used trust in Messengers like people of faith and they shared stories showing how they were discussing how they changed their minds without compromising their beliefs or their religious values in order to support the freedom to marry they also expanded the frame so they didn't just feature uh stories and messages from gay couples talking about why they wanted to marry they feature many stories of heterosexual couples older couples as well parents talking about how they wanted their gay children to be able to celebrate their love and the same way they did and these are really moving stories and really recommend people going on the freedom Tom marry website they've got a whole archive on their stories which are really worth checking out and they use a lot of relatable,19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,19:57,Messengers as well just like the truth campaigned it so they used everyday families of all generations and of all ethnicities on why they wanted their family members to be able to marry the loves of their life and they also use a lot of unexpected Messengers as well to really help shift The Narrative around this issue so they used police officers and firefighters on why they supported the freedom to marry for their gay colleagues so it really helped all of these different diverse unexpected messenges really helped open up this issue and people were able to see that actually a lot of America across section of America cared about this was in support of this and this really acted as a form of social proof and these Journey stories offered people the chance to think and act in new ways and really think about this issue in yeah different ways than they had to had been previously and really help them be able to change their minds in a way where their defenses went up because they were actually listening to stories and messages of people who were just like,20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,21:02,them and as the founder of freedom to marry Evan wolson said we turned this from what do you think about gay people to what do you think about your own values and I say this quote a lot but I think it's really really important for any movement and especially for us as a movement like how do we pivot how do we kind of shift what people are focused on about this issue so how can we apply these lessons from freedom to marry to our own movement so takeway one is connecting with shared values that was very key to um what freedom to marry did in their narrative strategy through doing their public research they realized they needed to move away from Ab abstract terms that didn't really have much emotional resonance with people and really connect with What mattered to them and for us it's like how do we reframe this not as an animal issue not something that just affects other animals but really this is an issue that is about our shared values it's about who we are as a,21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,22:08,society and another key takeaway is around Journey stories and again you see this in so many successful movements and their narrative strategies and it's really thinking that Messengers are just as important as the message and research shows that people are much more open to listening to messages if they're hearing it from someone who is like them or someone they look up to and they respect so really Messengers are just as important as the content of the message and we do already have some great stories in our movement so the filmmaker Alex Lockwood who's done some great short films about former industry workers talking about how they changed their minds and if anyone's seen uh the vegan society's future normal campaign they've got some great journey stories on their website it's really talking about uh people discussing how they connected with other animals or even how they had a light bulb moment and changed their thinking so again it just offers people that chance to think about this issue in new ways and to think about how they too can change their mind because they're,22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,23:14,hearing this message from someone who might be similar to them and another key takeaway is us at the moment framing animal Freedom as something where everyone wins this isn't just something that benefits other animals because I think when you know through doing research public uh research animal Think Tank people very easily get into Zer and some thinking and they think oh if you know other animals getting rights that means humans um humans interests are being jeopardized so really it's about framing this as everyone wins that we all benefit from a society where animals are able to live free the final movement I'm going to be discussing in this session is the together for yes which was a campaign in Ireland to legalize abortion so as I'm sure many of you know Ireland is a very devout Catholic country and for a really long time abortion had been illegal and was very frowned upon yet they achieved uh yeah majority,23
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,24:19,success and people voted in the referendum to make abortion legal so how did they do this how did they shift people that quickly again like freedom to marry they really connected with shared values and they realized that how they had previously been communicating as a movement this idea of CH choice that this was a women's Choice actually limited how people thought about this issue because it really individualized it and made it just about individual women and not about wider society and they realized to open up this issue and get people to connect with it they really needed to speak to Shar values so they didn't use they intentionally didn't use the word they used values like care and compassion and again these are aspirational values these are values that people like to see themselves as and this spoke to people both on an individual level and a societal level because people wanted to see themselves as being car and compassionate and they also wanted to see Island as being like that as well and through a lot of their Communications they referenced how,24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,25:19,Island had changed in the past and how it was a caring and compassionate Nation it really help people understand this issue about Island living in line with its values and people doing that too so it connected with both shared values and people's aspirational identities and they did feature individual stories of women but they did so really like framing them with dignity so it was talking about kind of the difficult decisions they had to make the emotions they felt and they really kind of dived deep into this in a way that was really nuanced emotive but framed women with dignity but they didn't overuse this technique of focusing on individual women because they knew through doing their research they really needed to open up this issue to make it a societal issue to get Island voting for yes so what was key was framing this as an issue that affects everyone and they were very intentional and Direct in a lot of their messaging with messages like these that sometimes A Private Matter needs public support and that really named what were people's barriers,25
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,26:26,to engaging with this before that this is a private matter so they they directed that head on and they're like this still needs public support and they put people in the frame so they didn't just share stories of individual women images of individual women they showed communities coming together and it's was very clear it's like communicating a story just through the these images of women coming together fors and communities coming together and looking happy and joyful and proud to be doing that and they really understood that they needed to make this relatable and really connect with people and open up this issue so they use messages like she lives on your street to really communicate that everyone knows someone who's affected by this issue it could be your neighbor it could be your friend your sister your mother your wife your lover it could be anyone so really this does affect all of Ireland this wasn't just an individual issue and they used used trusted Messengers so again through their research they understood that the people uh that those trusted most when talking,26
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,27:31,about this issue and people they considered experts were nurses and doctors so they use these as trusted Messengers to really help people connect with this issue and they also like uh truth and like freedom to marry use journey stories and if anyone uh isn't familiar with this really great podcast words to win by I highly recommend it and it features a really moving Journey story on there as well about a woman talking about how she previously have voted for abortion to be illegal and why she changed her mind so they shared stories like that over and over radio TV and print and again these Journey stories really help people shift their thinking and also made it kind of legitimate and valid for them to also change their minds on this issue so how can we apply the lessons from together for yes to our own movement I think a key takeaway is seeing that what we're asking is not just about individual choice this really,27
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,28:32,is about shared values and how can we connect people with this issue through a new lens that this isn't just about dietry choice or lifestyle choice this is really about us connecting with our shared values as individuals and as a society living in line with those another takeaway is putting everyday people in the frame with other animals too and really again it's just communicating that this is an issue that affects all of us and again it communicates this idea of social proof that when you're sharing images of you know diverse people caring about other animals taking action for other animals it makes people realize that you know a broad cross-section of society does care and again that idea of social proof that there's enough people caring about this that maybe they should too and another takeaway from both the together for yes campaign and the other campaigns and movements that we discussed is the idea of trust and Messengers and for us as a m I think one of the key trusted Messengers is vets because they are really seen as experts,28
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,29:37,they're seen as like true animal lovers people who are really knowledgeable and through research we've done ourselves surveys vets come out as number one they're seen as the most trusted Messengers on this issue so as well as featuring stories of everyday people that others can relate to and connect with I think that's is a key one as well so narrative strategy is really about changing the ideas that we live by both individually and as a society and it's about connecting with shared values and it's about connecting also with people's aspirational identities helping them to live up to how they see themselves and how they want others to see them and also how societies see themselves it's about communicating the issues through trusted messages and using strategic Journey stories from a variety of different trusted messages that really help open up the issue and key is really um communicating our vision like what we're for so you know thinking back to freedom to marry they were very clear like what,29
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,30:44,their Vision was and it was always about this is a win for love this is a win for everyone and it's like how do we really frame that what we stand for not just what we're against and how can we communicate that the problem isn't just about poty or suffering or death of other killing of other animals this is really about a violation of our values as a society how can we open up this issue so others feel that they too are kind of experiencing this the problem on an individual and societal level this isn't just some side issue that can be dismissed and also how can we communicate the solutions both future Solutions and also current Alternatives so people can really understand that change is possible and hopefully that change is inevitable and desirable as well oh sorry so yeah as I said we've done a lot of research on different social movements and there's yeah lots of inspiration from other movements I haven't been able to discuss in this webinar um very happy to in future webinars as well but yeah there is much for us to learn and be inspired by by,30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,31:52,other movements that really thought big that were strategic and really help bring about social ch that has benefited all of us so if you'd like to find out more you can um check out our website we have a newsletter which I think many of you are already signed up to but if you're not I'm think Lea will be putting some of the links in the chat as well um please reach out to us like if you're doing research if you have ideas like we always always want to hear from people if you want to collaborate with us and please do get in touch and yeah we have a messaging guide we have a research report these were from last year we're bringing out new ones um in September and we'll also be bringing out a social movement report which is talking about a lot of the stuff I've covered today and also uh insights from other social movements as well so that'll be coming out in the next couple of months as well um and lastly for anyone who wants to join our next webinar Lela is going to be talking about where Vision meets strategy so how can we as a movement craft our 40-year road map that can take,31
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,32:56,us closer towards animal freedom in the UK so would really recommend I've heard L talk about this before really recommend people joining so yeah I hope you'll be able to join us for that it's the 3D of July and again I think lel's going to be putting the link in the chat for people so yeah I'll stop sharing and open up the space for any questions that people might have wonderful thanks so much Natalie I hope everyone found that as interesting as I did my brain is wearing um we've got some a couple of really great questions um in the chat so I'll just dive straight in so sard is asking I know some research supports the use of moral shock or graphic images especially for animal sympathizers uh but it makes sense that for other groups this could create backlash do you know if there's any research comparing this to the use of humor in animal advocacy um that's a really great question I don't know if there's a specific study that compares the two and,32
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,33:59,if there isn't there should be um again yeah I think it's that thing of like thinking about where people are on their journey and I think yeah you named it exactly right sard that for some people who do already care about animals like this does connect with them like this is what worked for me because I already empathize with other animals um and this is what was like the big push for me but for others who maybe don't already feel as much empathy for other animals don't see them as kind of worthy of equal consideration sometimes kind of shock tactics can really uh shut people down and get people into kind of zero some thinking or scarcity or fear mindsets which yeah is like a barrier to people connecting with the issu so I think humor can be really disarming it can like you can kind of get interesting messages in through humor than I think he would be able to otherwise so yeah very glad we've got comedians like Simon amstore in the movement who yeah I think is great at doing things like that and yeah it'd be great to see kind of more ads that bring in humor and see how they land with,33
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,35:02,people great um so we've got um another question from Ashley it's rather long so I'm going to say it quite slowly or I can also just put it back in the chat because I know what it's like to be um told a question rather than reading it it's quite difficult sometimes so Ashley is saying building on sard's question about how some messages can Inspire some groups while alienating others so for example go vegan can trigger um you know om's defensiveness um Ashley is curious for your thoughts on reaching polarized or even just simply hetrogeneous or audiences in ways that one really speak to aspirational identities that might not be shared across all audiences um and to avoid appearing hypocritical as an organization if we are using messages that could be in Conflict like this is a really great question I'm also curious what you think Natalie did you get that kind of interested to maybe haven't fully understand understood the second part of the question but yeah like in terms of addressing the first part like,34
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,36:05,absolutely in agreement and we're doing some research actually in collaboration with others in the US as well it's going to be quite a big research project for us where we're doing segmentation because absolutely like some messages will work for certain people and not for others it will make some people motivated whereas it will make some people defensive so we really want to understand okay what kind of groups of people what values what aspirational identities what narratives what messages connect with them what motivates and inspires them and what doesn't and again for different groups and segments and really figuring out through that way how we can tailor our messaging to be more persuasive to those groups um I think there are some messages that can cut across I think those kind of Topline movement messages sometimes can um but yeah I think it's not a case that every narrative and every message is going to for everyone because we're all so different but it really is about finding this is about creating a toolbox I guess isn't it so how we can reach the broadest audience possible so yeah we'll,35
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,37:08,be keeping people up to date with our segmentation research but is going to be quite an involved project so yeah if anyone has uh any experience with segmentation and would like to help out with us like I said we're collaborating with the us we've got a couple of exciting organizations involved such as hatway Communications who are also involved with freedom to marry so really EXC exited to be working alongside them um yeah L could you re ask the second bit of that question yeah so the second bit of the question which I think you've partially answered is um how do we avoid appearing hypocritical as an organization if we are using messages that could be in Conflict oh okay so using messages that maybe aren't authentic to us yeah yeah so like if we've got different identities and we're targeting targeting different identities with different messages but it's like you know we're in this organization yeah yeah yeah that's a really really great question I think that um for me comes down to this idea that every social movement really has like a deep narrative that is very,36
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,38:10,authentic and true to what motivates them what powers this movement and I think if you're always drawing from that it is authentic I think obviously if you're communicating to different people sometimes you need to tailor that in different ways and I think yeah for public facing Communications I think really important to connect with people's intrinsic values I think um as a society we often think people are more motivated by extrinsic values so values like you know success or taste or wealth or fame um but actually know people are motivated most motivated by intrinsic values like care for others care for the planet so yeah I think it's really about connecting with the values that resonate most of people and not just thinking okay I need to communicate to yeah kind of the values that we are surrounded by when yeah that's kind of pushing onh helpful um values about Society um I'd also say yeah Beyond kind of public facing messages sometimes you know if we're if an organization is communicating with Farmers or with corporations or politicians and they,37
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,39:16,lobbying you're going to have to tailor your messages very differently while at the same time understanding these humans too who also have values and aspirational identities so there's definitely ways we can connect with them but also bearing in mind that yeah there's going to be different kind of framings and narratives that will need to be used that really kind of connect with them when they've got their say business hat on so I hope I'm answering that but if I'm not like yeah come along to the second session I'd love to hear you unpack it more great thank you Natalie um so Liz hi Liz um is saying are you familiar with the work of Frank Lun and George lov's work on messaging um similar to an shenka osario work on messaging that can speak to people's values and not letting the narratives of the opposition be the focus are you familiar with their work um yeah yes yeah yeah so I did um reference George Loff um in one of the slides I think one of his quotes but yeah really recommend don't think of an elephant if um people haven't read that,38
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,40:19,he really talks about how I mean it is US Focus but I think it's um very applicable to other societies but how we get polarized and divided um kind of on political lines and he talks about why it's very much about kind of people's World Views and yeah how we can kind of communicate differently without polarizing people so he's done a lot of work on that and I think and that shenar actually worked with Geor Lov so she's very you know aligned with this idea of not reinforcing unhelpful frames um and yeah Frank glun um I think there's a lot to learn from him um again another great book to read of his is um hang on it's something like words not words to win by because that's a Nat's podcast I think words that work um but yeah I'll have to do a Google search that I have read it and it's really great and he was actually um one of the people who coined the term climate change through doing public research he realized that global warming was too alarming for people so to help uh fossil fuel Industries they,39
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,41:25,actually reframed it as climate change which sounded much more pleasant and less alarming so yeah we have Frank Lun to thank for that but yeah there's definitely lots to um learn from him because he's worked for many different organizations and politicians and he's done tons of focus groups as well so we need to be learning from yeah many different people and yeah great to hear you yeah you're familiar with all of these yeah and Liz has just put yeah it's words that work by Frank Franklin thank you Liz yeah um okay let me just find the there's another question I wanted to ask okay so hope hi hope um she says I like to use live vegan instead of go vegan as go feels more like finger wagging what yeah what about the word vegan itself there are some who feel that we need to move away from this word or this messaging whereas others counter that we just need to remove the negative stereotypes associated with it and reframe the word and connect it to compassion the animals Etc what are your thoughts,40
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,42:30,Natalie um yeah I I agree with that I think um for some people it's going to resonate and I think again it's like where are people at with their Journey like where is their kind of mental model already around veganism like for me I was vegetarian and you know seeing horrific stuff around animals and then being told to go vegan I was like oh my God yes but you know for other people that would not be that's not where they are at their point in their journey and yeah that would not be persuasive so I think yeah I think we need to be approaching this from many different angles and I think the movement has already done a really great job at making veganism less weird and more aspirational like obviously we're not as far as um we need to be but yeah again I think we've done research on this animal Think Tank like people very much when they hear the word vegan it puts them in a food frame so I think it's like a massive job to reframe vegan ISM as not,41
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,43:28,about food but about ethics so is that too big a task for us is do we need to be communicating to values um yeah I think that's open Tobit we're doing kind of testing on that but again I think it's down also to different segments and this is where our segmentation research will hopefully help us that knowing does go vegan or live vegan which I think is much better framing I agree hope um yeah does that resonate more for certain people than other calls to action so yeah we'll be really curious in the after hour session to hear others thoughts as well I think it's a big debate for our movement absolutely um there's a question from Alex I'm a bit confused was this to Natalie or to Hope Alex uh was it to Natalie um can you say a bit about the eight waves of campaign activists um Market segmentation who are the early adopters um this is quite long um basically yeah I think um yeah Alex is asking can you say a bit about you know the different waves of um campaigns at SL the,42
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,44:38,different market segments like from early adopters to um those who follow is there yeah any thoughts that you have on that yeah now I think that is a really good framework to think about like where people are at like both individually on their Journey but where societies at as well and you know hopefully we're Beyond like early adopters but is basically for people who aren't familiar it's like this bell curve so it's like you know um yeah basically kind of tracking change and it's very much a marketing tool I can't remember like the actual specifics hopefully um Alex can share those but yeah is this idea that people who are earlier doctors are much more open to this idea of change and then other people only kind of join in when they see more people doing this so it is really like once you reach a t Tipping Point then that acceleration happens much sooner and yeah who who knows where we are um as a movement I guess only time will tell are we like further back than we think we are we further ahead and Chang is going to happen more,43
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,45:38,quickly um but yeah I think it is a useful framework to think about yeah where we are as a society on that bell curve thanks Natalie um so amit's got um a thought here so yester he says yesterday my four-year-old um little one had a jar of smoothie and got a green mustache and he says I'd like to see a campaign um with people with a green mustache like got smoothie or something to overwrite the got milk campaign and I know we've talked about um like the check off got you know got milk and all of those sorts of things at animal Think Tank I'm just wondering if yeah you have thoughts on that yeah I love I love that um Amit I think yeah you should be communicating that to others and I think just these things like it's it's flipping the narrative but it's doing it in a really humorous way I think yeah kind of using kids as well um yeah that would be great to test something like that yeah for sure um Liz um is saying reframing the word vegan might possibly feed into a,44
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,46:40,reactionary response that plays into constantly explaining why this negative word should be positive I'm not sure if reframing the word vegan in some spaces or countries might change people's minds who already attach socially negative feelings to it it would be interesting to test it yes agreed yeah great are there any other questions or Reflections um I was going to just ask Natalie would you would you mind explaining a bit more about segmentation because I know um you know for me that like that's been a new thing that I've learned at animal Think Tank and I might not be familiar with um people yeah sure yeah it's um I mean it's known by different names either like personas or psychographics so it's it goes much further than demographics is really understanding like where are there clusters of certain groups of people who say perhaps motivated by similar values who have similar um aspirational identities who perhaps um have similar trusted messenges like understanding,45
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,47:44,where are they getting their information from where are they sharing it and then through all of I mean it goes much beyond that it would be things like what are their thinking processes are they kind of introverted are they extroverted do they have a abundance mindset a scarcity mindset there's yeah a lot of kind of nuance to all of this but it's really understanding who are these people on a deeper level what are their interests what motivates them what um kind of shuts them down what kind of actions are they likely to take as well and through Gathering all that data both through um kind of quantitative like big surveys and also qualitative you're really able to build up these segments and understand these groups of people who have a lot of um similarities in common and then you're able to test kind of tailor messaging and test it on these segments and work out okay these kind of narratives these kind of frames really resonate with these people but they're really turned off by these kind of narratives and frames and then because you've also understood okay this is kind of the people who they trust this is,46
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,48:48,where they're getting their news these are the kind of websites they go to you're actually able to kind of Target those channels and reach those people um much more strategically so it really helps understand yeah what what resonates to people because at the moment you know animal think Tech we've been doing large scale message testing but you know we are finding these messages that are these kind of frames and narratives that are more persuasive but we're not at the moment understanding are they only persuasive to certain groups and they're very persuasive for those groups or are they persuasive across the board so segmentation just allows us to have a lot more data a lot more insights into people and really connect with them um in ways that will be hopefully much more motivating and enable them both to hopefully take action and really engage with this issue great thanks Natalie um so Benjamin is asking do you have any advice for stories to tell that convey things like carnism cognitive biases inherited biases Etc I'm guessing that,47
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,49:52,means stories that can disrupt things like kism yeah I think like going back to other social movements I think um kind of pulling the curs back on the tactics of the industry can be really helpful and help lower people's defenses because you know they're not feeling like they're the one at fault they're the ones to blame but they're realizing that actually you know as a society we've been conditioned by an industry to think a certain way so really exposing the tactics can kind of expose the framework and then once the framework is exposed um it's not as solid as it once was so I think that yeah like I said this is kind of early research for us but is something we have found is really persuasive when people kind of start to get to grips with the levels of um kind of Deceit and tactics that the industry uses they quite um enraged um I mean the,48
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,50:48,problem with this it is it can move people to a sense of utility where they think okay you know if they're just lying about standards about welfare standards like what's the point about even trying to buy higher welfare I'll just buy cheap meat which is obviously not where we want to take people so it's really about um yeah communicating exposing um what the industry is doing but like I said not framing them as like an enemy that isn't able to change um but holding them accountable I think is important yeah so I think yeah really kind of putting back the curtain on this can um kind of really shine a SP light on it and make it much more kind of vulnerable and yeah kind of hopefully overtime weaker those narratives that uphold it much weer great thanks Natalie uh we've got a couple more minutes um I'm not seeing any other questions in the chat I was going to ask you um so you said vets were um really trusted Messengers um for the animal Freedom Movement are there any other um types of people um that you,49
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,51:53,think or that we've found to be trusted Messengers um I think yeah I can't remember I need to like double check the data but I'm pretty sure that actually some animal organizations came up quite highly as well which um we were surprised by um so yeah we' want to do kind of more research into which one specifically imagine you know organizations like rspca um and maybe certain sanctuaries um would be seen as trusted Messengers um whereas others who perhaps are seen as having some kind of agenda um maybe less so great thanks Natalie okay well we've come to time almost um lots of um people in the chat saying thank you for all this interesting information so I've put um the link to the after hour session in the chat um and I'll leave um this meeting open for a few minutes so that people have time um to click the link um if you want to hang around and ask Natalie some more questions or share some of your ideas and some of your findings and your campaigns um um but,50
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTT0Rq8kM-c,Why Having a Narrative Strategy Can Help Us Win Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,29 May 2024,52:57,thank you so much Natalie that was great as always um and yeah look forward to seeing some of you in the next session thank you thanks everyone,51

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAAVeJ7-eNk,"How we will win Animal Liberation - Laila Kassam, ALC 2019, Berkeley California",Animal Think Tank,16 Jul 2019,34:26,for us it would be you know maybe some kind of constitutional amendment or some legislation that changes the paradigm from property to plasma hood for other animals and then we can think about what are the milestones or the medium-term phases to actually achieve background or grand demand and then we can go one stage lower and think about what are the campaigns that we can do that can help us to achieve those milestones and then at the bottom level we can think about one of the tactics and methods that will help us to achieve those campaign demands okay so if we think about the civil rights movement we can I'm just gonna use this as an example I'm sure they didn't strategize like this even though they digitized very heavily but their grand strategic objective could be something like equality for people of color which still has not been achieved their milestones could have been desegregation and equal voting rights then campaigns the desegregation could have been the national lunch counter sit-ins the Birmingham campaign the,32

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAAVeJ7-eNk,"How we will win Animal Liberation - Laila Kassam, ALC 2019, Berkeley California",Animal Think Tank,16 Jul 2019,37:39,idea of symbolic demands now symbolic demands are designed to polarize before and polarization means costing issues in terms of right and wrong so again it's sort of helping or asking people to pick a side and like I said before the natural logicounter system campaign in the segregated lunch counters was symbolic of their oppression they knew it wasn't going to end segregation but it was a symbol of their oppression so they went after that and in a really classic example of a symbolic demand the bullet campaign was with thumbietot March he did it mobilize people around clicking the British out of India he mobilized people around this the injustice if the British monopoly on assault which I mean something it seems kind of random but it's something that touched that people almost everybody followed because it affected everybody and it was through this that he was able to build a mass movement okay so we've talked about the power of people the power of momentum,35
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAAVeJ7-eNk,"How we will win Animal Liberation - Laila Kassam, ALC 2019, Berkeley California",Animal Think Tank,16 Jul 2019,38:45,and at heart strategy what does all of this have to do with animal liberation how can we use these ideas and concepts to win I mean it's so difficult because it's like these be these them concepts and strategies are very complex or rather they're difficult to actually apply to the animal liberation movement I have distilled ten lessons which I think it can provide a starting point for us you know some food support as we move forward and this is actually part of the work that animal think-tank the collective that I'm part of is committed to do you know how do the lessons of past social justice movements apply to our movement and how can we use them to win Animal Liberation so if we want to reach this three point five percent of the population then we are going to have to mobilize people who are not vegan yet and this might sound counterintuitive to people and it may be even hypocritical I mean for a long time they've had a hypocritical to me but we need to,36

When my child was born, I was asked if I plan to breastfeed or use formula, and I planned to do both actually. And I chose to use a plant based formula an FDA approved one",4

For the same reason I don't want to put dairy products in my body, I felt that it wouldn't be right to give them to my daughter. I know that dairy would increase my risk of certain cancers. It's really high in hormones and other kind of things that really I wouldn't want in my body and certainly wouldn't want in my daughter's body. I explain this to my pediatrician, and actually she was really cool about it. She was like... ""Well you plan to use an FDA approved formula",5

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,0:01,um thanks yeah and um I'll be talking about um disrupting dominant narratives and how we can Empower animal advocacy with data so I'm gonna just start straight away with what is a narrative um so a narrative um is like a set of stories myths ideas or beliefs which propagate through a culture um and they have an influence on the way we see the world and the way we act so it can affect how we interpret events and which is the way we perceive the world and it can also influence the way we behave because they can kind of sort of dictate and shape social norms and just a couple of examples um of real world narratives so the first is the American dream um which is one that kind of says like you know if you come to America everyone's got the equal opportunity to work hard and kind of make the life that,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,1:06,they want and it this kind of like um emphasizes values of like individualism and hard work and things like that and then um in back in 2016 um I can't believe it's that long ago already um we were debating should the UK leave the EU and um there was kind of two sort of opposing narratives going on so levers said you know we want to take back control of our sovereignty and get control again over immigration whereas the remainers were saying oh but that's going to come with um all this economic risk and we're going to lose certain rights and protections and um so I'm going to kind of describe our theory of narrative change so when we're communicating to people about animal Freedom um you know you've probably heard the phrase like oh we've planted a seed there you know we like to think of ourselves as planting ideas in people's heads and hopefully over time that will grow into something and but I feel like at the moment we're,2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,2:10,living in a world with like an infertile cultural landscape the dominant narratives are kind of fostering these beliefs and attitudes which kind of prevent these um seeds from germinating so hopefully by changing the narrative we can find new narratives that will change the cultural landscape and sort of facilitate all of these seeds to germinate and so here's what we want to do we want to improve attitude towards other animals and we can do this by first centering animals in our messages and stories through positive portrayals and reinforce existing helpful narratives about them and we also want to see new persuasive narratives and hopefully what this will achieve is to kind of crowd out those harmful narratives that are currently,3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,3:08,um sort of maintaining the status quo and the reason we believe this can work is because it's worked in previous social justice movements and this is just two examples so the freedom to marry movement was um well more of a campaign I suppose to um legalize gay marriage in America and previously they'd been their narrative was one about rights and deserving the right to marry and they changed it to one of um having the freedom to marry those that per the person that you love and you know in America the concept of Freedom that resonated really well with people and by targeting values that people had they were able to change the way people voted and in quite a short space of time they were able to succeed in like in their campaign similarly black lives matter you know I think everyone's heard that phrase,4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,4:11,um The Narrative they're saying there is all these killings were being treated like our lives don't matter and that short um phrase made it spread really well and it captured the light guys so that you know it's very tweetable um and it's become like a household phrase I suppose okay so his narrative animal think tanks narrative research project we want to find the most effective cultural narratives that will help us win public support for animal freedom and so I want to um first kind of give you a bit of a taster of what it's like to take part in our research um and Natalie will be helping me with this so I'm going to show you a couple of um uh questions or statements and I want you to think how much you agree with them uh so for each statement I just want you to type in the chat,5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,5:15,um the number that corresponds to how much you agree or disagree with the statement um so the first being eating animal products is a part of the natural food chain or cycle of life and so just enter the number in the chat for me and and because I'm sharing my screen Natalie's gonna have to uh watch the chat for me and maybe you could share kind of what people are put in cool thing yeah we're getting lots of ones coming through some people strongly disagreeing or we've got two in there as well so disagree but yeah mainly um all ones and just I mean color me sharks really you know that was an easy one I suppose um so the next one is humans have a unique value that sets them apart from other animals so yeah just like before one to seven and please enter the number and that corresponds to how you feel which way I can't see where to enter it but I'm just gonna meet people um because we are recording,6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,6:24,yeah getting um a real mix actually and lots of ones in there the odd two and three even um a five so somewhat agree that today yeah yeah yeah I sort of had a feeling that one might be more mixed um at the narrative Workshop in February I sort of asked a similar question and that one was quite mixed as well um but yeah I guess there's a bias towards disagreeing in general [Music] and then finally uh the third one is animals should be recognized as sentient beings who feel pain and emotions so yeah if you could put into the chat your the number corresponding to how you feel on that yeah lots of sevens come in you know all seven is actually from what I can see brilliant cool anymore is that it yeah um that's great so basically our,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,7:31,research involves asking people to fill in surveys with many many more questions than just those three and some of them will involve qualitative questions where they would kind of expand um either through write written text or talking to us about their feelings their thoughts experiences and then some will be a little involved experiments that I'll talk a bit about later um where we test the effectiveness of different narratives um and there's some different things we can do with this data so the first is to create profiles about people based on the way that they respond this array of questions um it helps us understand the General on attitudes and beliefs of the population and hopefully we can then track these attitudes changing over time and it helps us predict you know are these different types of people responding differently to different narratives,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,8:33,and so here's the research questions that we've got um so previous research has kind of already identified lots of harmful and beneficial narratives that I will be describing a bit in a moment um but so far these haven't been Quantified in the sense that we don't know how widespread these narratives are or how strongly the general public endorses them and we also don't know like which narratives work um or how how well they work so that's something we've been doing um in our two kind of research streams so I'm going to start with which harmful narratives does the general public endorse um and I know we've got people from all over the place um but this is a representative sample of the UK so hopefully it's kind of generalizable but obviously just something to bear in mind and I'll go over this um graph more later on but basically we've,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,9:36,kind of found seven dominant narratives um that the general population endorses and they endorse them to different levels as well um so I'm going to kind of go through these different narratives that we'd identified first and then we can talk about it in a bit more detail uh so the first one um this was found in the academic literature first but it's really reassuring that we can kind of replicate it um it's the four ends or normal natural necessary and nice and these are like the top four justifications that people give for eating meat so you know either everyone does it so why can't I uh it's natural I.E my ancestors ate meat lions eat meat so therefore I should be able to um necessary there's a strong belief that you can't have a healthy balanced diet without meat and then finally it's nice you know it's associated with,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,10:35,certain memories like um Christmas or it just tastes nice and people enjoy it and so when people fill in our surveys and people that endorse this um narrative will agree with things like I was raised eating meat and it feels normal to continue doing so or the example I gave earlier eating animals products is part of the natural food chain or cycle of life um and yeah so not surprisingly our sample here today is pretty low in endorsing this particular narrative um but it is quite an influential one and it's one that the um that that that's pushed by the industry quite effectively so here's an example of an ad campaign where they've got kind of the meat as the center of the dish and to a meat eater I'm sure this looks really appetizing,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,11:34,um so they're kind of tapping into the the niceness aspect of it but the tagline is also we balanced um basically implying that the only way uh you can have a healthy balanced diet is like with a big chunk of meat and a bit of salad on the side and also of course you've got the glass of milk there in the top right totally essential the next common narrative that we've identified is one called anthropocentrism which is a belief that sort of puts humans as the sort of top of the hierarchy of moral worth and it basically says that humans are kind of uniquely special and separate from the rest of Nature and that because of this these features uh we have the right to use other animals for our for our ends and so people that endorse this narrative would respond to us would agree with these sorts of statements like humans are inherently have more value and rights than other animals or that humans have a unique value that sets them apart from other animals,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,12:46,the next narrative is economy and this is basically the belief that we kind of need the meat dairy egg industry um to support and maintain the the economy that we currently have and that you know Farmers need us to continue purchasing these products in order to keep their livelihoods and their jobs um also now that we've kind of going through this period of kind of financial insecurity there's this um element of kind of needing to feed the population at large and a belief that without you know animal products we wouldn't be able to feed the whole population affordably and so people that endorse this narrative um would agree strongly with these sorts of comments um rural communities often depend on animal farming for their livelihood and the meat Dairy and egg Industries are crucial for the economy providing jobs and Revenue,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,13:47,and this is another one um that at least in the UK that I'm aware of is pushed by the industry so you can see like the British flag there kind of tapping into the the idea of britishness and supporting each other by buying local British food um back British farmers and so on um another narrative we found is one called meters manly um so this gentleman on the left here is a YouTuber uh who goes by the name liver King and he's known for endorsing this carnivore diet where you basically entirely eat um animal products and a lot of his videos involve him eating raw liver um so he he was kind of selling this idea that um that's how you know that's the diet you need to be this like alpha male with loads of muscles until it was kind of found out that he takes loads of steroids but I mean who would be,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,14:52,surprised uh not just looking at him um so where does this like belief come from um I think it comes from in part this kind of traditional idea that you know the men go out hunting and they provide the like essential nutrients uh to the rest of the tribe um and so as a result of that meat represents like strength power virility and the Act of Killing kind of represents dominance and power and so by like consuming meat your kind of strengthening the gender identity of being this like provide strong and powerful provider basically and so people that believe in this narrative um would agree with these sorts of statements like eating meat is associated with strength and masculinity or refusing meat can be seen as a sign of weakness or femininity um yet another one that gets used by the,15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,15:53,industry so here's an example of an ad where they're trying to convince men to buy more bacon to put on their burgers basically saying like if you want to be manly you need to eat more bacon um yeah the final one um that I would consider as a harmful narrative is that of welfarism which is basically the belief that animals should have their welfare protected which you know that that makes sense um but that it's okay to consume kind of high welfare animals I think the problem with this is that the public are actually largely in the dark about where what how high welfare animals are actually treated you know I think the chicken on the left is kind of how a lot of people imagine free-range chickens get to live their lives and but when they're actually polled about like for specific practices that go on in high welfare Farms the vast majority of people are against them um so examples of the types of,16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,17:02,um statements that a welfareists would agree to agree with would be animals used for food clothing or other purposes should be treated humanely or I support standards and regulations that ensure the welfare of animals used in farming um so here's a kind of what I think the problem is with this is that it can be used to um kind of alleviate people's guilt so believing that you're kind of consuming an animal or product Animal product that came from an animal that like lived a good life and like a painless death um kind of perpetuates um the purchasing of those products um so like this example here you know they're representing the lives of these chickens in a way that's just not representative of the vast majority of of chickens farm that are farmed however we did also find some helpful narratives so what are those that people,17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,18:03,endorse so the first is kind of the vegan narrative um and um you know you might not see that as a narrative um but it's kind of like a set of beliefs it gets spread throughout the culture um it's a way of framing things and it basically boils down to avoiding animal products is better than consuming animal products it also entails this kind of idea that change for this like change of the system takes place at the individual level so like your responsibil you're responsible for the harm that you do and you can kind of control that basically and so people endorse this view would respond to questions um in agreement with things like choosing not to eat animal products is a more ethical lifestyle or society's acceptance of veganism or vegetarianism is a sign of moral advancement and the final,18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,19:07,um narrative that we found was that of sentientism so sentience is the capacity for an individual to have a subjective internal experience which gives them the ability to have feelings and perceive things and feel Pleasure and Pain and it also entails the belief that animals other than humans are also sentient and therefore because of their sentience they have personal interest and therefore their rights should be protected and so um people who um our sentientists would agree with these statements animals should be recognized as sentient beings who feel pain and emotions or animals deserve legal rights that protect them from harm and exploitation so kind of the aim of this project was kind of to see like how widespread are these narratives uh we know they exist how how common are they,19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,20:10,and this kind of goes back to the plot that I showed you at the start so each kind of column represents a one of those different narratives the the height of the blue bar um represents the proportion of people that agree with that narrative and the height of the kind of pink slash pinky Red Bar is the proportion that disagree while gray represents kind of indifferent people and so we find the top two narratives are the welfarist narrative and the economy and narrative so perhaps these are the two that we need to kind of be sort of undermining or overshadowing as much as we can luckily though sentientism and veganism the two positive beneficial narratives come in third and fourth place um I actually find it quite surprising uh that the veganism narrative um is endorsed by 60 of the population when um you know only like two percent of,20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,21:15,people are vegan and maybe up to I think it's like up to about 10 or some form of like vegan vegetarian pescatarian reducitarian um so that's really useful to know and I think what this shows us is that the public actually feel conflicted um on the one hand they recognize what the right thing to do is and they recognize that animals are individuals with personal interests who can suffer but on the other time other side they're supporting this like really kind of abusive industry and unfortunately a lot of the time uh this conflict has to be won by one of these two narratives and it often goes in the wrong direction because there's these like dominant narratives that we've already talked about so how do we bolster beneficial narratives and find new ones so this is the second stream of research that we've been doing um testing messages so we recruit a,21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,22:20,group of participants and we expose them to a different set of narratives so this could be reading um a trans it could be reading like a document or it could be watching a video um that forms an ad campaign for example um promoting animal Freedom um but different participants will be exposed to different narratives um and we then measure their attitudes about animal Freedom like the ones that I've been showing you and the aim is to see do the people are exposed to certain narratives end up reporting better attitudes towards animals so first I'm kind of going to show you a couple of narratives that didn't work because after all um this is science and you don't know if it's going to work until you've done it so unfortunately we do get no results uh one of them is identity so kind of appealing to people's identities so for,22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,23:25,example we had messages that said things like you know we're a nation of animal lovers so why do we allow Factory the practice of factory farming to continue or similarly you know we're all caring individuals um so why do we let factory farming continue another one was um descendants so you know we're going to be leaving the World Behind right we're currently descendants of future generations and we want to leave a better world for them and but unfortunately we found that none of these appeals to Identity actually had any effect on people's attitudes um and uh apparently also in the environmental literature similar studies I think someone's just unmuted similar Studies have attempted to appeal to Identity and also found it doesn't improve like environmental behaviors so maybe,23
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,24:26,um kind of targeting people's identities doesn't work but we could Target the values that are associated with their identity like maybe someone doesn't like see themselves as a caring individual but they do care about others and so kind of future research will be um kind of targeting those values um the next thing that didn't work was um using the the terminology speciesism and oppression um so we actually found that when these terms were used they actually made attitudes worse um I think there's a couple of reasons for that first is these are kind of like activist jargon um it's not the usual language that most people use and it sounds weird to the average ear um it also kind of paints The Listener the receiver of the message as like the bad guy like we're responsible we we are speciesist and we're responsible for their oppression,24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,25:31,um so I think what's happening is it kind of creates like a feeling of reactance and like kind of stealing yourself against the message um so I think we need to either avoid these types of terminology or do more work to make these um these these terms more widespread so for example you know when feminism started a feminist um um or sexism were like new terms but they're now like widespread common common household words but luckily we have found some narratives that have worked um and I'm gonna explain those now so the first is social progress so Society basically this narrative entails the idea that Society is progressing all the time and the animal freedom is just the next step in that progress and that you,25
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,26:31,know you can refer to past movements such as the suffragettes um in as part of that we also found that um messages that were about social progress but made no mention of animals but also um improved attitudes towards animals um so that's known as a spillover effect so basically in one message uh we talked about like um LGBT rights and how society's moving along and making it more it's becoming more equal and fair and there's now rights to protect people um and that's a good thing and we found that people had then had higher attitudes about animals and we believe this is because it's kind of activating the same values of like universalism and benevolence the next one that works quite well is reminding people of the unique about abilities and diversity of abilities of,26
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,27:33,other animals like all other animals have their own unique kinds of intelligence um and this can help create a sense of bore and reverence towards those animals and then finally the third that we found worked quite well was um emphasizing morality framing the issue is this is a moral issue what you know we the right thing to do would be to facilitate animal Freedom uh one way this can be done is you know invoking the Golden Rule which a lot of people believe in that is we should treat others the way we would wish to be treated so with this all in mind what can we do about it first is I think a strategy known as pulling back the curtain so researchers found that if you just present the harmful narratives as they are to um to people that might believe them it kind of like they kind of see it as as it really is so if you say like you know a lot of people believe,27
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,28:45,um eating meat is okay because it's natural um people the the person that hears that can like recognize that um actually like that doesn't really make sense if you think about it um and I think here's two ad campaigns that that do that quite well so on the left um Elwood's organic dog meat um is a sort of parody site kind of um where they um uh pretending to sell dog meat and they use all the same lingo from the meat industry like it's delicious it's local free range humanely harvested um and obviously this Riles people up and then when they go to the website they see um they're they're just trying to point out that the these reasons are not good enough um similarly on the right is an ad trying to break down the Humane myth um by saying like Humane milk is a myth um and it raises the the awareness of people by mentioning that Dairy carves are separated from their mothers and so,28
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,29:51,that humans can take their milk so I think another thing we can do is flip the narrative so for example with the four ends um we can raise people's awareness about vegan food being natural normal necessary and nice and we can also raise people's awareness about there being nothing natural or nice about things like industrial factory farming um similarly the belief that meat is manly we can ask people like what does it actually mean to be a man you know I would say that caring for others is the mark of a true man and then similarly uh the economy narrative could focus on the plant-based transition and supporting Farmers to keep their livelihoods but just doing something else um and examples of organizations already doing that uh the plant-based treaty and animal Rising um next is I would I would argue for values based messaging so I think people,29
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,30:57,already have the right values their hearts are in the right place but like I said earlier they feel conflicted and there's this kind of a lifetime of narratives that have been instilled in them that are very hard to overcome so I think using messages that activate the right values without arising this internal conflict um might help there and then finally we need to use narratives that work so we've found that these three narratives social progress abilities and morality are ones that are more likely to increase people's reported attitudes so um we're going to have like a kind of q a session now and before we go on to that um just want to draw your attention um to the webinar next month uh which will be with Jim Mason um who authored a non-natural order and this book's been really influential for,30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,32:01,our thinking um at animal Think Tank and similarly if you'd like to sign up to our newsletter if you haven't already and you'll hear about more webinars and the research that we're doing and if you would like to support our ongoing work and research you can scan the QR code there to donate so I guess we'll open up the conversation now and yeah I'd love to hear what everyone thinks thanks Rob do you want to um stop sharing your screen and then we can see everyone's face yeah I was thinking um of leaving it up just for a minute in case people want to scan the codes oh yeah good idea um but would you mind like facilitating the uh like questions and stuff yeah sure we've got a question from Maureen um she'd like to know how you selected survey respondents respondents yeah yeah so um it depends on the specific study so,31
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,33:02,um they recruited online um and there's platforms that allow you to kind of create your survey you put it on the platform and it gets sent out to people who've signed up to um to take part in paid research um and they have options so if you want for example to um have a representative sample they've got all that information about the demographics and so on and so you can kind of tick the box for that um yeah and then also Natalie's doing some work on kind of the the supportive base and she's um targeting kind of like I guess vegan Facebook groups and things like that um yeah I hope that answers the question um so yeah if people want to put their questions either in the chat or put their digital hand up and um yeah you can ask directly um corinda yeah so I'm like thank you for coming and um,32
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,34:03,my question is Bang Bang also I want to know why people um pinning anymore I'm really sorry that like audio quality is really poor um can you try again or maybe just type it in the chat no I want you to know lying people and pinning animals like wild people like blinking animals um not very nice and important easy anymore and also when people are thank you when people were vegetarian [Music] um so why why do people kill animals and then why do and then I couldn't hear the second part sorry like how do people with people with happy fairies yeah yeah,33
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,35:15,how does it work when they're vegetarian yeah like can you clarify what you mean like how does what work you know what inspires people and motivates them together yeah yeah yeah we're doing more research into that I don't know if you want to speak to that anymore Rob um yes I guess that second part of the question it's hard to answer right now because we haven't got the results yet um it seems to be I don't know do you have any kind of have you had any insights yet Natalie since you're spearheading that um yeah no still results coming into two um early to say but yeah just to make people aware of some research we've got going on at the moment it's um focusing on people who already care about animal issues and support animal issues and finding out what motivates them and inspires them to care about these issues and also and take action as well so we'll be able to share the results of that in the next couple of months yeah and then as for like um killing you said killing animals do you mean just like why do like people like every day why would and every day,34
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,36:22,yeah yeah um well I mean I guess it's rare for someone to directly do it um hunting I suppose um they might have they might believe in the uh meters manly narrative or some narrative about um welfare you know the if the animal has lived um a wild free life then that makes it okay as for like you know like animal abuse um I can't really comment I don't know to be honest it boggles the mind um webinar next month with Jim Mason he really Dives deep into the big kind of deep cultural narratives that like really inform like how people think the way they do like how we kind of yeah kind of going to think this way as a society so really encourage people to come along to next month's webinar because he kind of really pulls back the person on that as it were um Courtney you have a question,35
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,37:23,yes thank you all this is really as a you know as I continue to to engage with the research you all are doing I continue to be impressed and I think it's very important for us to do it this step-by-step manner that you all take um I'm particularly curious about the social progress aspect and I think that ties up very well with other elements of the research you've done this evolving narrative that's important for people and the idea that um you know people aren't necessarily just seen as consumers but as people who can create different narratives and live in a culture in which their citizens I'm wondering my question I guess is about what level of agency do you think and this might be grounds for further research that that we should bring to people on this social progress um vain I mean should we be saying this is happening and you should just be aware of it and and become um be amenable to it when it shows up or what role do you have to uh Advance this,36
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,38:26,and I I do think that you'll probably get a a lot of general buy-in philosophically to yes I could see this happening down the road and you know that seems okay but like now you need to you know right now you need to start your behaviors need to start reflecting this shift I think there's a big difference so yeah just the thoughts along what that looks like in terms of what we ask from people yeah that's a really good question um I think uh maybe this isn't a satisfying answer um but yeah maybe we do need like a range of levels of agency so they're kind of like people on the the extreme um are we're going to be asking like Get on Board and do something uh the people in the middle sort of movable middle maybe just changing their their opinions and values will be enough because it will make those kind of more radical extreme people be perceived as like less extreme um yeah but like you said more research is needed yeah I guess it's kind of like two,37
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,39:31,problems isn't it Rob like we're looking at what can change people's attitudes but then also what can motivate them to take action as well so um yeah definitely further research needed um I think Barbara did you have your hand up first and then I'll come to you Pamela I I had but you can continue with other people and I can still like in the end because if you don't have time I can talk to you like privately sure okay thanks um Bob we'll come back to you Pamela do you want to ask your question yeah hi so thank you um it's been really interesting um presentation um and yeah food for thought so I'm I've got a couple of um questions about the wording that you're using when you talk about narratives um obviously I understand what narratives are yeah but I sometimes think uh that well I'd be interested in hearing your views on using words like propaganda because narrative seems to imply that you know the uh the the whole thing is just somehow sort of like you,38
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,40:36,know magically appeared and is quite a sort of it's an unloaded term and I think that uh is in itself part of the problem so that's narratives then there's using words like meat um I was interested to hear that you were using it uh alternatively with words like animal products and again simultaneously I tend to use or I tend to think that it's better to use uh words like animal body parts or you know I mean although it's quite long I feel like it's you know it's like what's the name um that woman that wrote the um what was it the absent reference Carol what was her name Carol I'm sure you've read all or read all this that by having um the word meat you're taking the animal away from it um so yeah I'd be interested in in what you've got to say about those words and then I'm also interested in your concept of saying that speciesism is a turn off uh and I can't remember the other word you used uh and is it it,39
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,41:40,may be a turn off well I think in the same way that feminism and feminists are they they identify something that previously was really unidentified I think um and therefore it's kind of quite key to uh re reframe the conversation if it is somewhat uh people might be a bit hacked off but I mean how yeah how hacked off are they really or are they just feeling a bit like oh it's a bit jargony but is it like geography but it's so okay so those are my sort of starters for 10 really um I'll probably have to ask you what they were again but I'll just go with my initial kind of like uh feeling of that so um I think it's a there is a bit of a double-edged sword isn't there like on the one hand like since sort of doing this I've been trying to change like the language that I use um you know like I used to always refer to animals as it and now I always make I,40
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,42:43,make a conscious effort to refer to them as they and now it's just it feels weird to refer them to them as it and that's helped me see them as like more individual and so on um the example of meat I suppose I just use it as like a kind of shorthand maybe but I totally get like the issues with it um I think it's a double-edged sword because um on the one hand you wanna it helps to use the language that people naturally use I think on the other you don't want to like yeah on the other if you use the more kind of I don't know PC language for one of a better word um it has the risk of turning people off and I think it goes back to this like conflict people have that they're very it's very easy to get people to go into these like cognitive sort of defense strategies where they sort of try and protect their perception of like a good person,41
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,43:45,um and I think if you start if we if we use language like animal flesh for example it's it's very I think people find it very easy to then switch you off and then they're not listening um hope that answered a bit of the questions you want to like refresh my memory yeah I'd also like to um come back to you on that one it was uh what was it uh if it but it's actually a fact isn't it I mean meat is not a fact and flesh and animal body parts oh perfect and and surely part of the I mean it's not like people are going to be automatically on board I mean this is the thing talking about you know you're talking about basically claims making and sort of theories but I'm I'm kind of uh I just feel like it's really important to call it what it is I am jumping here because yeah we have read like Howard James Adams and Joan,42
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,44:46,denier and yeah that is really influential for us and we obviously do want to like shift towards more Pro animal language but we have found that people do have this resistance and actually like it turns them off the message so a long like part of our research is understanding how far we can take our language at this point in time but thinking like we shift it incrementally um and that's just unfortunately the way it is you kind of have to speak to people in the language that resonates for them and keep pushing them in that direction because otherwise it just jars and people will just shut down and not even listen to your message it's kind of got to be they've got to hear the message rather than just the language we're using if that makes sense Pamela well yeah but that's that's I don't know how much that is actually I mean you're saying that with a lot of confidence and presume that you you will have done some research on that but I come back to you know using words like you know not you using words like feminist you know or or black person rather than the pejorative,43
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,45:46,terms that were used um you know as we all know uh not so very long ago and and I and I don't I don't I mean I can't I can't imagine a similar conversation you know like say back in the 60s we had people advocating who sort of you know women's rights and so yes well we don't really want to use those like feminism because it turns people off it turns people off because it's the dominant culture and yeah and I suppose what what would that what would you would you we have said then if if your animal Think Tank was like sort of like feminist think tank or something not in the 60s what would you be saying then I mean what would you be saying you know well we don't want to use the word feminist although it clearly is a position that most people don't understand and it creates a reality that is invisible to most people I I just don't I don't understand it and I wonder if there's some sort of like exceptionalism in animal causes because this often not not not um necessarily intentionally but,44
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,46:54,um because it is other animals right humans and I'm concerned about that because again the other the other word that I was interested in or focusing on was propaganda rather than that was it yeah so yeah and I think because you know it's all part of a propaganda um sorry just to jump and I'm just like time checking here if Robert's able to answer your question then we can open them to other people yeah hopefully Pamela we can have a really good in-depth discussion about this at some other time because I think you've raised some really interesting and valid points um totally gonna take this away and have a think about it and also you know we we're not claiming to know the answer and with research especially it's always evolving um and maybe next year I'll say actually we need to go hard on this I don't know and then with regards to the propaganda point I'd love to like do some testing,45
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,47:53,around that because it's yeah like raising people's awareness that they're being kind of lied to um by these kind of greedy Industries I think that has potential to work yeah we're kind of inspired by another campaign who's the truth initiative that kind of did a similar thing against the tobacco industry and that was really um powerful as well so yeah that is like quite high up on our list of projects to focus on in terms of research and how people respond to this idea of like deception from um the industry um do we have any other questions um otherwise I'll come back to karinda and then Barbara before we close um anyone else like to ask the question who hasn't already spoken if you've got any in the chat um corinda do you want to ask your question and then I'll come back to you Barbara bye oh I have two questions [Music],46
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,49:18,behind you animals than what sorry we film or study animal behavior no no this is more about like human attitudes about animals um yeah there's lots of great ethology books out there corinda if you're interested that do film and study um animal behaviorists so you might not speak off um Jonathan balcon they're really great ethologists that you can look into um yeah yeah and then about losing weight I mean like it's yeah I guess I don't have the expertise to give like dietary advice I mean I think you can lose weight on sort of any diet um but that not that that would like justify um kind of what has to be done to the animals to I don't think that would justify eating meat or animals um Barbara do you want to ask your question yeah yeah uh yeah I really loved your,47
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,50:20,presentation Rock uh yeah very good and I didn't know like all these discoveries um I I just uh like with this result about like narratives that work like social progress abilities immorality I was thinking here if you have been thinking about like where to circulate these narratives because uh for example social progress is a narrative that I'm not sure if it's going to work with uh like right wing uh population uh and maybe abilities in the end would work for animal lovers even though they don't identify as animal lovers so yeah so I was wondering like uh if you have started to think about like in like which Target groups you could like put these narratives there yeah that's a really good uh question um I mean I haven't started thinking about it in depth but it's definitely,48
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,51:21,part of the plan to eventually look at kind of how different segments will respond to different narratives so like you said social progress probably won't resonate with right-wing people um and also another aim is to do um is to um yeah look at like how the effect of how the The Narrative is um kind of propagated um so like only one example I can think of off the top of my head is um Studies have sort of shown to use like trusted Messengers so like if a farmer or um maybe I can't think of another example bomb is giving the message it's more likely to be accepted than some like EK Warrior Lefty vegan um yeah but yeah it's like research that we're gonna do eventually and wonderful thank you um any other questions,49
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,52:22,um Evan James the viewer muted to ask a question oh yes I have a number of questions I think first of all that um and I've delineated them in the chat I'm sorry I didn't know how to raise my hand um yeah first of all I think that we need to have a change our perception of uh who the world believes that we are because I think that they think that people who advocate for things like this are these elitists uh and we need to sort of dumb down our message the lowest common denominator if you will because the you know truth be told those are the people who are consuming most of the Mead um they're uninformed and they refuse to believe that anything is wrong with any of the current systems so I think we need to sort of get down to the bottom level which is kind of like against what I think most of us would want to do um and just make it explain it to them in the simplest terms I think we need to appeal to people's,50
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,53:26,growing fears of what's happening with with climate change uh without maybe using those trigger terms like climate change or global warming but appeal to them to the fact that look what's going on around you look at all the flooding look at all the um fires look at all the droughts look at starvation levels Rising the Food Supplies are are becoming endangered in so many areas because of these things and let them know that you know these things are happening they're real they're coming to you soon and if we don't shift away from you know our current attitudes about what it is we eat and what we need to sustain the planet that we're all gonna die I mean without sounding too alarmist which is a tricky very very tricky line to walk but somehow we need to incorporate all those things into our messaging um being very very clear being catchy but being simple and appealing if you will to people's fears because I think,51
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,54:29,in this case that may be the only way to get through to them um we do need to do you know to massively shift our Global food production system this is obvious just and we should sort of sort of hear it if you if you if if I may with our need to shift our dependence away from fossil fuels the same sort of things there are two streams there they need to happen at the same time concurrently sorry to interrupt them just so we're ready for a couple of minutes did you want to formulate a question for Rubble was it more just kind of sharing thoughts in him like well yeah I don't know more more like suggestions um and the one question I do have is in the U.S where I am um the lobbyists are so powerful for the meat and dairy Industries um it's really really quite daunting to to try to make an inroad in there um in terms of like lessening their their Stranglehold on the on the food system you know production system in the,52
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,55:29,United States how might we best do this such a big question yeah it's sort of like the mean of the meat no pun intended um yeah it's like more than an uphill battle isn't it um oh yeah yeah um I just I don't even know where to start and these are just things to sort of think about because I sign a zillion petitions all the time I share information I try to increase awareness but you know I'm up against these powerful and well-moneyed interests yeah yeah and that's sort of I mean so our kind of approach is like a systemic like a systemic approach um you know actually trying to change the system and create narratives that will like get lots of people on board um yeah because you know like I was saying in the in the talk like people's,53
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,56:30,values are already there it's just making that connection and kind of overriding the power of these like lobbies and things in people's minds but even if it's just for long enough to get them to act and I kind of hope like these sorts of um social changes like they kind of happen exponentially so it's going to feel like a really long time when nothing's happening right and then all of a sudden there'll be some like trigger um usually a disaster or some kind of catastrophe that's that's what that's the only way that humans ever actually do anything yeah I mean um I don't know I think there's examples of like social justice movements where that's not necessarily been the case like um you know but it'll it'll certainly take off I hope I'm really I I'm I'm hopeful I feel confident that that's going to be the case and I'm really sorry just jump in like really encourage people to look up freedom to marry as well because they were you know they have this strategy,54
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,57:34,they were at it for a really long time and it was only when they did a lot of public research that they understood what people was kind of barriers were like where there were like opportunities to leverage like and they understood that they really had to message to their values and within 11 years they had marriage equality in 50 US states whereas they've been trying for decades before and that was through a lot of public research on through the strategy of narrative change so um yeah that is a really inspiring example of how this yeah this can happen right which is what you're endeavoring to do and I I'm totally behind you I mean I think that messaging has to be very clear and as I mentioned earlier it has to really just sort of head home with people in a very easy sort of catchy way which is really kind of tricky um but you know uh because there are people people's attitudes are so ingrained and most people I mean I'm in my 60s you know I was raised eating meat but then my mother became a vegan later in life um and my whole family actually shifted,55
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90M-tohpKc,Disrupting Dominant Narratives: Empowering Animal Advocacy with Data,Animal Think Tank,31 Jul 2023,58:39,over once I told them we are at time okay but yeah if people want to stay on afterwards I'm going to stop the recording now and thank you so much to everyone who joined us really great um questions and insights coming up and yeah hopefully you'll be able to join us for next month's webinar on the 30th of August with Jim Mason that's like really insightful conversation and to look forward to and yeah thank you rob for your presentation thanks and thanks for everyone's enthusiasm and passion I love it it's great,56

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,0:02,um so animal think tank is a bit different for most think tanks uh we see ourselves as I think and do tank um as what we're doing is putting Research into practice uh building a social movement for animal freedom in the UK as well as thinking more long-term uh strategy wise in terms of strategic campaigning uh how to effectively organize and mobilize people to push for Change and creating a resilient movement culture for the long term a big part of our focus is on narrative change and that's where I come in as narrative Lead Animal Think Tank um and specifically um we look at how we change the dominant narratives in society about other animals and our relationships to them that's why ATT is reading on a long-term narrative research project uh to determine what can most persuade people,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,1:07,into joining animals into supporting animal freedom um as well as then taking this research and sharing it for free and offering guidance to others in the movement uh we're actively collaborating on Research with others and thinking about long-term strategy for our best to embed helpful narratives in UK culture so to continue animal think tanks webinar series after a bit of a Hiatus uh this session we're going to take a look at the relationship between deep narratives and World Views and the interconnection between the two I'm going to demonstrate this interaction using examples related to animal Freedom specifically but this is an interaction that takes place in many many different Realms in every realm you could imagine but before we actually dive into what narratives and World Views actually are I'm going to talk a little bit about stories and why they're such a powerful mode of communication,2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,2:11,So Stories um connect emotionally facts connect intellectually as humans we're hardwired to respond to stories rather than facts while facts are persuasive in a very logical way uh we all know that humans aren't that logical creatures stories are persuasive in ways that actually appeal to us the emotional way they have the power to move us and connect with us in a way that facts alone just can't um I think a good example of this is the I think most of us remember John Lewis's Christmas ads more than we remember the slogan never knowingly undersold uh and that's because we respond to plots uh stories um then we would to a factual and explanation of why John Lewis is good value for um people zooming in from uh countries as in the UK John Lewis is a is a department store here in the UK and,3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,3:15,every Christmas they have uh an advertisement that um tries to make you cry uh with us with an adorable story and that's and it's this isn't to say that facts don't matter I'm sure that some people respond to John Lewis's slogan that they're never knowingly undersold and but facts are remembered more and they mean more if they're communicated within the story I'm going to read you a quote now from Sharon Blackie who some of you may be familiar with she's a psychologist and a mythologist and this quote is on why storytelling is important to humans stories matter not just entertainment matter because humans are narrative creatures it's not simply that we like to tell stories and to listen to them is that narrative is hardwired into us it's a function of our biology and the way our brains have evolved over time we make sense of the world and fashion,4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,4:22,our identity through the sharing and passing on of stories and so the stories we tell ourselves about our world and the place in it shape not just our own lives but the world around us cultural narrative is the culture okay I'm going to throw it over to you guys in the chat uh what do you think she means by that last line the cultural narrative is the culture uh please feel free to type your thoughts into the chat cultural narrative is the culture do we have any it's okay if not because I can just tell you what she means thanks Courtney yeah the stories we tell create the culture we live in yeah that's part of what she's getting at definitely okay I will see if anyone trickle in within a couple of seconds but I won't put you on the spot for too long,5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,5:38,yeah so what Sharon's getting at is that the dominant cultural narratives about Society create the dominant culture exactly like Courtney says narratives and stories have the power to shape our culture and culture in turn shapes the dominant narratives we're surrounded by so there's a real Synergy a real interaction between the stories and telling the culture we live in I've had a good weather there we go graphic some of you may be familiar with um if you came to uh one of our events in February but I'm using it again because it helps us illustrate what Sharon Blackie was talking about when she refers to cultural narratives the stories and narratives were surrounded by influence how we view the world uh with some narratives more dominant than others but before I go,6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,6:39,into these terms in detail and unpack them I'd love to hear first of all how you all understand the concept of narrative sorry I'm putting you on the spot with the chat again because you know we've got to interact here what does narrative mean to you that can be you know a little bit simple feel just write your thoughts in the chat um I'd be very grateful familiar template followed to tell stories yeah like a like a a plot a setting Etc yeah that's one way to to understand the word narratives commonly understood story of a cultural group the underlying meaning yeah somebody subjective experience a way of understanding others oh that's good job somebody's subjective experience hmm oh we have a load of we've got a load of different interpretations that's great narratives and master friends are quite similar okay yeah great okay thank you for sharing those,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,8:00,everybody uh so this is how we sort of use uh these terms in a um in a more theoretical sense that animal Think Tank because obviously you know the way we use narrative in day-to-day life may not be how we we use it in this context so a deep narrative right at the bottom of the mountain here is what we Define as a grand cultural idea that shapes and reinforces ideologies and World Views it's so deeply embedded that it's just seen as common sense it's not seen as something that's been constructed over time that some it's it's just common sense uh it is what it is deep narratives underpin higher level narratives stories and messages and um and other big unifying ideas or themes that connect all of them,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,9:01,um an example of a deep narrative that was used to good effect in the uh in the fight for lgbtq rights is the Deep narrative Love Is Love which is particularly um good because it also acts at the level of being a message it's it's a slogan um but it's also this all-encompassing idea that unites many higher level narratives stories and messages another example of a deep narrative and this time um a more harmful one is the idea of fearing the other so you can you can see how that deep narrative is one that would show its face in Myriad different contexts so you see it in uh horror movies about you know murderous extraterrestrials killing all the crew on a spaceship um but you can also see it in negative discourse about people seeking Refuge um and also lgbtq people and also other animals particularly those that we deem,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,10:06,as pests when we move on to narratives uh above the level of deep narratives so these higher level narratives they're the unifying idea that connects related messages and stories further up the mountain they work to give these messages and stories more meaning uh they often also act as a cultural memory so go back to the theory of the deep narrative um a narrative that can spring from that and I'll use the um lgbtq example here is this cultural idea of trans women or gender non-conforming people as predatory somehow who pose a danger to cisgender women a very harmful narrative there stories um higher up this is where we get to the level of cultural products and this is what sometimes we call narratives in day-to-day speech so a story is something that has characters you know,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,11:12,uh it has a plot it has a challenge of choice it has an outcome little red white Riding Hood is an example of a story we're all familiar with them but what they do is communicate and reinforce the narratives and deep narratives that they stem from um I'm going to again continue with the uh narrative about trans women or or sort of gender non-conforming people a narrative example of them being sort of someone who should be feared is the Hitchcock film psycho uh it presents us with Norman Bates and that's a man who cross-dress dresses and and murders women um and while this you know probably wasn't intentional on the part of the filmmakers it does it's a story that pulls on this deep Narrative of fearing the other and fearing those who are gender non-conforming uh the same thing happens in Silence of the Lambs of Buffalo Bill this is a story that we tell ourselves again and again in our culture foreign and now I'm going to move on to this top level messages I've mentioned them once,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,12:16,or twice but they are basically micro Communications so communicated piece of pieces of information they take the form of slogans quotes uh even memes hashtags leaflets little things like that so I've used an example as I've talked through uh this diagram related to transphobia but I'm going to populate it now instead with an example related to animal freedom to put this in a different and more sort of relevant context for us these slides will cooperate of course okay so with the level of deep narrative that uh looks over too quickly we have the idea as humans being separate from nature this is the we're all familiar with this as um people in the uh and Freedom Movement but it probably wouldn't be apparent to people outside it this is the basic idea of human exceptionalism so we aren't animals we're Masters Of The World,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,13:21,um and that there's something intrinsic to humans that differentiates us from the national natural world and puts us in a unique position from this deep narrative humans being separate from nature that Springs are more culturally obvious narrative here um that Human animals sort of naturally fit into subservient relationships with humans and even enjoy it whether that's the naturalized relationship of a pet and an owner a horse and a rider or a zookeeper and captive animal moving up to stories now there are going to be many many examples of this of this narrative and deep narrative reinforced being reinforced by stories but these are the first two that that's brought to mind for me uh Black Beauty um and animal park so Black Beauty uh is a novel that was actually good in the Victorian era for generating sympathy for horses as individuals but it still had the effect,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,14:27,of normalizing the master servant relationship um this other example animal park for um this is a uh a daytime television program we we have in the UK um about the captive animals and keepers at longleat Safari Park uh which presents this this sort of um relationship as natural positive mutually beneficial and finally uh moving on to the level of messages we are again at this level of quick minor micro Communications again just like with stories there are going to be countless examples of messages that pull on this map of meaning that pull on this steep narrative and the higher level narrative that we have around human animal relationships but I chose this particular Pro Sea World hashtag um because it's a nice and simple one to show our diagram essentially it fits in that small triangle it positions SeaWorld as caring about,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,15:30,other animals by keeping them captive and brought them into form which you know obviously highly problematic so again I'm afraid I'm going to talk to you with the chat again um can you think of any other stories or messages that pull on this narrative and deep narrative if you want to stick them in a chat so the idea of humans being separate from nature and then drawn from that animals enjoying captivity and master servant relationships yeah this one is a little bit hard to ask you to do off the cuff so I'm going to just give you to give you a little time yeah we balanced great uh yeah horse horse racing as a as a message yeah to be reinforced by stories I I guess yeah Charlotte's Web yeah reinforces the sort,15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,16:36,of relationship there between um oh I can't remember the names Wilbur Wilburys the little girl hmm the idea and tropes are animals protect animals yeah yeah so these are some some uh great examples of messages and a couple of stories in there and it gives us a feel for how deep narratives can show their face in so many different ways than in so many different context again sorry I'm having a technical difficulties oh yeah we've explored what deep narratives narrative stories and messages are and how they they all Interlink how they build upon one another and all of these are shaped by as well as shape our worldview so we're moving on to the sort of interaction between deep narratives and worldviews now I'm sorry for this to be so chat intensive but I like to keep you on your toes before I uh talk through what do,16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,17:47,you think makes up a world for you you know try and keep it concise I know that you could you know there could be essays written on this um and just write some thoughts in the chat if you have any about what makes up a world for you yeah just go to Disney a chance to have a break and a drink thanks Alex culture plus lived experience most upbringing values and social norms yeah very well thought out set of beliefs that inform structures and actions yeah culture experiences exposure education yeah great great thank you and this is um there is a lot of thinking and research around World Views um and yeah you've captured quite a lot of them believes by his experience yeah you've captured quite a lot of what I'm going to show you next um and these are some of the key components that make up worldviews so values yeah we had values we had beliefs uh assumptions is another layer,17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,19:03,attitudes and ideas and these factors influence our goals desires relationships and behaviors so I'm going to uh talk through these now um about the foundation of World Views so first of all beliefs that's a belief about what the world is like though How the Universe was created human nature are we inherently good or are we inherently bad uh the direction of society are we uh doomed are we doomed or are we moving forward in an inevitable positive March of social process progress uh values um another Foundation is what the world should be like uh in terms of our world for you so um do we value equality and freedom or do we value money and security uh constructs now these are mental structures that organize how we perceive the world um and a good example of this is uh what it means to be a man what uh,18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,20:12,expectations and behaviors do we place on the the social role of a man this is a construct that that can uh affect the foundation of our worldview and now we move to emotion motion is a is very foundational to our World Views because we're incredibly emotionally invested in maintaining our worldview in protecting our worldview and when it's threatened we experience anger and fear which is an effect that I'm sure that all of you will be familiar with in your various lines of work within the animal Freedom Movement and then finally uh stories narratives and Frames these are how we choose to explain things congruent with our worldview this is is how we I guess broadcast them um and a good example of this is an origin story of the universe so if you have a religious world view a religious belief about how the universe was created you're you'll probably have an origin story to go with that in a you know due to a Christian uh Traditions,19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,21:18,it's seven days um creation by deity I think the simplest way to put it is that a world view is what we believe but narratives and also our emotions are how that belief is expressed and communicated and the narratives that we're surrounded by really shape our worldview because this is a symbiotic relationship just uh just as the dominant worldview can shape which cultural narratives are more dominant so narratives and World Views can both influence and reinforce one another so this is kind of a very very sticky very uh complex concept worldviews can be so hard to change because of this real sort of emotional investment and this complexity they're deeply deeply embedded in our deepest fears and insecurities and,20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,22:23,um maintaining World Views um really fulfills fundamental human needs the first one is a need for meaning uh understanding how the world works a need to manage educational fear and anxiety so you know the concept dealing with the with the fact that we're all gonna die one day and also a need for a shared sense of reality so it's you know it comes really down to our to our deepest um needs of social animals to help maintain cohesion within a group I'm going to talk to you now about two opposing World Views that come into play when it comes to human animal relationships the dominance and kinship worldviews um ideally it is animal Freedom Advocates we would rather that the kinship one was the prevailing one in,21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,23:22,society uh but that's not the case unfortunately at the moment a dominance uh worldview with relationship with regards to human animal relationships is the dominant one but that doesn't mean that the idea of kinship is a new world view that we have to create we're not we don't have to make it up out of whole cloth because it's actually an ancient worldview uh before animal husbandry that wasn't really this distinction this other than distinction between humans and other animals um we were sort of seen as part of Nature and we felt more kinship towards other animals as recognizing them as part of the uh as as you know an equal part of the world and the um I suppose the ecosystem but eventually when we started to control other animals through Agriculture and husbandry it led to this dominance worldview which is the which is the prevailing one today we lost our,22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,24:23,sense of animality or our sense of animality has been sublimated and we lost the sense of kinship as well well both of these worldviews they they perform a similar function even though they're opposite because they just give us a framework for ordering Society they just have different priorities but they both speak to this idea of what being civilized and fair means so from a dominance perspective humans are separate from nature from a kinship perspective we're part of nature uh from a dominant perspective we sort of focus on individualism personal gain from a kinship perspective we focus on more Community well-being and we can see how these two views you know not only affect our relationship with other animals but with other humans as well and one way we can help to change the world is to change people's World Views and this is the important this is the important thing uh relationship between,23
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,25:29,narrative change in World Views that we need to explore this is where the idea of narrative change comes in if enough of us reinforce helpful narratives through the stories and messages that we choose to tell over time we can overshadow harmful narratives which can help shift people's wealthies away from one of dominance and towards one of kinship using these stories that appeal to the emotions that would otherwise um lash out and protect our you know more dominance worldview but obviously that's easier said than done because worldviews are very tough to change uh changing dominant narratives to shift people's worldviews is absolutely crucial to our workers animal Freedom Advocates but we need to remember and we need to appreciate how embedded worldviews are and how tough they are to change because we're emotionally invested in protecting them,24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,26:34,I'm just kind of made a hilarious meme there God I'm funny um we're just emotionally invested in our World Views because they're they're linked to be honest to Who We believe We Are emotional biases lead to us making justifications based on how desirable we consider them rather than making them based on an accurate reflection of the evidence which is how I think we all think we all like to think we would make our decisions based on fact but often that really isn't the case um yeah this this hilarious Meme here I've used to um to sort of fit to um illustrate confirmation bias with biased to accept arguments and evidence that confirms our existing worldview and will dismiss information that doesn't there's even an effect that's been uh observed where we continue to just continue to believe discredited information if it confirms our world for you regardless of the facts and evidence that we're presented with which is a,25
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,27:45,rather depressing reflection on on human nature and that's why being exposed to stories and narratives rather than facts can help shift somebody's worldview in a way that facts alone can't to reach people we need to understand shared values and beliefs despite different worldviews and the way we do that is connecting through narratives finding the values and beliefs that are shared by a lot of society is key to connecting with people and it's important that we list up those values through the narratives stories and messages that we tell narrative change is a never-ending process sometimes narratives change unintentionally but sometimes it's very intentional and as animal Freedom Advocates we need to be really intentional in reinforcing helpful narratives rather than unintentionally reinforcing harmful narratives,26
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,28:55,so I'll talk through now through um a recent example of narrative change or a relatively recent example of narrative change um there's a narrative change undergoing at the moment about how about animals who live in the sea um more and more ethology books like the best seller here on the left what the fish notes are sort of coming out you can see uh the strap line of this book the inner lives of our underwater cousins books like this are really rooted in a deep narrative and also a world view of kinshu kinship because it operates at both levels of a deep narrative in the world for you this idea that we're deeply connected with other animals and how does and have much to learn from them uh the middle image here is a is a vinyl album it's really cool this this is a vinyl album of whale songs that was released in 1979 and it still Remains the biggest first impression of any vinyl record and it went out to millions of National Geographic subscribers,27
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,30:02,uh this album was great in that it helped people seeing whales as cultural beings who create music and communicate in ways that we as humans just aren't capable of understanding but can still appreciate and still approach with a sense of awe or a Wonder so it really helped shift public Consciousness away from this idea of Wales as monsters of the deep and and created this this huge surge of support for Greenpeace and uh other organizations that were working to end whaling at the time and then this uh this final um example here my octopus teacher some of you might be familiar with it it's a an oscar-winning Netflix documentary uh which had a female octopus here as the main character she was framed as a unique individual uh she was playful curious smart caring and you know had a deep and intelligent personality and it,28

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,33:13,humans so to jump back to show this on our diagram we can already see this narrative shift taking place when we start from a deep narrative kinship with other animals higher level narratives that we we uh that we end up telling look more like this they look more like humans and other animals sharing the same desire for freedom at the level of stories we start to see things like Free Willy and black fetch as I just mentioned uh Free Willy was you know and this is um this is again evidence of this this deep narrative never disappearing because Free Willy in 1993 uh pulled on the exact same um hold on this on this uh this framework here and it was really effective in that it created public support for um freeing the Orca uh Kiko I think I think was his name used in the film and it gave him um unfortunately not a long time but 18,31

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,35:29,hello okay um think Courtney all right okay well now I just I don't want to take too much time but this is complicated I just wanted to say I really appreciate the thinking here I think this is really important I think it is from my perspective a little bit more difficult for a farmed animal um messaging around kinship because of the separation between the animals themselves and the products that are you know that people encounter uh in this situation of animals in captivity I see easier shifting points because you see the animals there especially when you add in entertainment um so I guess I would like to just put on the radar the distinctions between different animals and how you know what's possible and is it possible to see pests as you know we have a kinship with them so just a point I wanted to make there yeah I can definitely say I'll just apologize for running a sound,33
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,36:29,interference we have some canine colleagues here who are uh making their presence known um yeah I think the the sort of Distinction yeah the the sort of um disconnect that goes on in people's head with between a an animal and meat is definitely something to consider and I believe it's something that um is on our radar for testing in terms of uh what works for different animals uh what doesn't but when we sort of connect at the level of um yeah stories and deep narratives it's like we can get the the it's making that extra step isn't it sympathy for the pig is probably not the same as sympathy for bacon so we'll we'll see uh so Tiana I think you had a question in in chat,34
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,37:29,if I can there we go uh well news of numbers when it comes to animal agriculture is there any research as to whether they can be effective or can there be all motivating as there's a huge and overwhelming so I would my instinct would be that numbers without emotion numbers without stories will be functionally useless I mean this is because you know facts facts without emotions aren't very uh aren't very sort of um they don't pull on us as humans as much as um emotions do so I think also uh the potential yeah research uh that has been research done on individual compared to mass numbers so people can connect more with the sort of individual animals involved than they can with with abstract numbers it's the reason that animal resistance stories tend to to work so well why,35
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,38:38,people will usually um run to support a um a cow that's escaped a killing shoot and leap to six foot fence then you know they would to it to a more dry number okay okay do we have any more questions if no one else has a question I will add add one more but there's someone else oh is this someone else [Music] hello sorry I didn't see you there yeah Shibari hi hi everyone um yes so uh thinking about um uh all the things that you've you've said uh I uh well I I left the corporate world um uh a long time ago and I now,36
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,39:45,run my own um uh vegan businesses um but uh when I was in the in the corporate world I I used to get a hard time uh for for being a vegan by my colleagues by my bosses and um I remember my former boss um had um pet her chickens and yet she would eat um eat other chickens as well so you know it wasn't as though it was um she had a pet from um a species that she didn't eat um it was um you know she she ate she had chickens as pets as well as eating chickens and her excuse was oh she can't eat um her um her pet chicken tins and because she adores them she even had names for them but the reason why and this is her explanation um that she could eat other chickens is because she disassociates um them as as you know like um they're,37
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,40:48,not her pets and um and therefore she can justify their justify eating other chickens um yeah so I it's a crazy world really yeah it it really is where you know you you know that um chickens um have feelings um you you know you look after them you take care of them and but in her mind um it's perfectly okay to eat other chickens and well yeah and I think this is potentially because this sort of um this this is the world view that's been sort of continually reinforcement right and it's certainly with the the same sort of um constant reinforcement of the counter narrative that will get anywhere as a society uh I think um marginals would like to a little bit of solidarity with you there I've also come from the corporate world and my uh marketing and my ex colleagues take take,38
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,41:53,the piss quite a lot yeah and I mean one positive you know that we can we can take is that um Chicken Run do you remember the film chicken run it was our an argument film it did temporarily affect the sales of chicken meat in in general because of the you know the identification with the with the individuals you know it did go back up again unfortunately but it shows what what a sort of mass reinforcement can do even if temporarily so if we were to do this sort of if we were to be intentional as animal Freedom advocates in in continually pushing out the right narratives the right messages the right deep narratives then maybe that's an effect that would take place for a longer term and forever yeah it's almost so it has to keep on happening um because I think um uh humans have short memories so you know they may have um the shock factor and then that shock Factor kind of um goes,39
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,42:57,away and you have to kind of keep keep on reminding them yeah until it becomes Common Sense until it becomes the the dominant deep narrative yeah yeah thank you thank you sorry did you want to make another was it all and did you want to have okay I just wanted to say that um I think um the um I've been vegan for a very very long time like many decades and uh I think what has changed for the positive is uh is the whole idea of um not eating animals and I think um what's changed very much in the last three four years is um is that when you tell people that you are a vegan for example um uh it's not it that there's I get a real sense that there's like a oh yes I understand I get that and I totally um uh appreciate where you're coming from and I have an understanding of what you're doing um and I think that that's and also I,40
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,44:03,often get this underlying feeling like it's I I wish I could be as well but you know it's a step too far for me whereas I think uh in the not very distant past it was like yeah you are worthy and Out Of Reach and you know that there's no way that I'm going anywhere near that so I think there's a shift that is very much happening in society certainly in the western world and which I think is is really positive and it's just how we continuously build upon that that the idea that it's not a crazy diet it's and people are slowly shifting from that even though they're not shifting themselves it's I think it's an interesting one because it's it's brought us I feel that that's brought us quite far that you know this this increased in acceptance but I am concerned that it it pulls I think it pulls too much from Deep narratives related to kind of like individualism and freedom of choice rather as rather than it does,41
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,45:09,on what's morally correct you know the I so I I wonder whether in the longer term whether moving to a a deep narrative that's more that's outside of the Paradigm that we exist in currently would be more effective to to longer term long-lasting social change but yeah it's definitely it's a foundation isn't it it shows us that it can happen just piggybacking then on the conversation about deep narratives I think this one that how you framed it humans are separate from nature is you know it's an interesting one that is negative but is certainly also has a potential spin to it which is positive which is we can choose our diets right so in the if we are in the natural system right then we would not be able to kind of orchestrate different ways of doing things um and it's I I think it's a it's an interesting thing to to for you all to,42
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,46:19,think about how a lot of alternative companies right use technology and the future of the food system as a frame for what's great about what they're doing and really is not about kinship it's about we actually can transcend right our natural eating habits right and construct a lot of different options from technology um so I think in in a way this ties in what you're saying with like what kinds of what's the larger rubric is it all capitalistic based um you know and what does that mean and so just just to point out then that there's this a bit of a consist a contrasting approach to this deep narrative in which that scene is a value and used to construct messages of alternative foods that are futuristic yeah but that's pretty that's interesting yeah I'm not sure how to respond to that first,43
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,47:24,sort of just off the cuff but I would open the floor up to anybody else if anyone has any thoughts because that's I'd love to hear them Courtney when you say alternative foods do you mean um things like um lab grown meat um and um uh Dairy that's made you know by fermentation um from from cells is is that what you mean by the the future of alternative Foods Yes except yeah I'm being very wedded to the term cultivated meat because I think it plays a lot better with the public than lab grown I would say yes cultivated meat and precision fermentation Technologies right well um my point of view is that um it dilutes the the message of um of veganism you know we we all want um it to become a vegan world you know hopefully in in my lifetime I don't know,44
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,48:27,whether whether it will but um but that's what we what we want and um if we're promoting um you know cultivated meat or you know whatever the the term is then we're kind of saying that um that plant-based um you know plant-based meat if you like it isn't good enough um that uh that people um you know they're not gonna get all the all the nutrients and that you can get from a plant bait of Whole Food plant-based diet or from um uh you know from um meat Alternatives that are completely plant-based um and that uh you know it's diluting um the message of of veganism um promoting uh you know cultivated meat or a Precision fermentation that that that's my opinion I'm not really for those um you know sort of alternative um ways of uh yeah I mean I'm I'm just not,45
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,49:31,uh not for that because like I you know I'm a long-term vegan of 25 years um and I I personally wouldn't uh Myself eat um cultivated meat or Precision fermentation dairy products or anything like that I mean I I can see that um in a world that isn't vegan um that so sorry oh I I can't hear you Natalie don't worry um we're just saying we've just got five minutes left so yeah that's it's okay I just wanted to show you one more slide share again but do you finish your point oh yeah I mean um I don't know what other people's point of view is um but for me I'm I'm just not um for this um you know cultured meat for precision fermentation I I I don't want it to go that way because I I believe that um you know it it dilutes the um the message of,46
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,50:36,veganism and um and I want there to be um uh a vegan world that is uh you know holy plant-based rather than having to extract it's still using animals you're still using the cells of animals and the cells of uh of um dairy uh dairy milk and um and and yeah so to me it isn't vegan yeah I I guess just to finish I'm I guess my concern as well in well not concerned but but thoughts having listened to everything is that if we focus too much on the diet sometimes we can not deal with the underlying causes of the prevailing diet and that's a sort of speciesist world and if we you know we could all become vegan and still Force animals to perform still you know um still race horses you know so it's I think there's there's a deeper level of,47
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBrNOLYsxs,Introduction to Narrative Change and Worldviews for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,11 May 2023,51:40,change that would be good to activate if we can so I will just now buff you with a final slide once my tech has uh decided to play ball okay and this is just a Shameless plug for our next month's webinar I hope you've enjoyed this one and thank you so much for all of your uh really insightful thoughts uh and next month we're going to be diving into this even deeper with uh Claire Parkinson who is a professor at The Edge Hill University and the co-director of the center for human animal studies uh she'll be drawing on recent research to discuss the impacts of popular animal narratives and pro-vegan messaging on different audiences uh during the session she's going to be talking about anthropomorphism and how it can be used effectively in that context along with,48

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSA82QDvzRY,Bienestar de las gallinas ponedoras y el impacto de la transición al sistemas sin jaulas,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,1:02,bueno las diapositivas están en inglés para el caso de que alguien quiera pasarlas a compañeros o compañeras que que no hablen español pero por supuesto hablaré en español y me gustaría empezar con una pregunta qué os parece que está asociado a una cantidad más grande de sufrimiento animal sería por ejemplo la castración de los lechones sin control de dolor o el confinamiento y aislamiento de sus madres en jaulas de gestación qué os parece que es más sufrimiento ahora otra pregunta y teniendo en cuenta la respuesta a la pregunta anterior que cada uno tiene la suya como este sufrimiento que habéis atribuido a estas dos prácticas se compara en términos de magnitud al al sufrimiento asociado por ejemplo algunas formas de sacrificio sin aturdimiento o por ejemplo a las,2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSA82QDvzRY,Bienestar de las gallinas ponedoras y el impacto de la transición al sistemas sin jaulas,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,2:09,fracturas de la quilla de las gallinas ponedoras o al confinamiento de las ponedoras en jaulas convencionales qué os parece que es peor no en términos de sufrimiento o quizás una pregunta que a lo mejor os parezca incluso más relevante al tema cuál la cantidad de sufrimiento Cuántos sufrimiento podría ser reducido con una reforma una intervención de bienestar animal Como por ejemplo la transición hacia las a los sistemas en esto es importante comprenderlo porque las reformas de bienestar animal las intervenciones los acuerdos las políticas son muy frecuentemente gestionados por por la industria y relación a los beneficios para el bienestar animal Entonces por ejemplo Aquí hay una noticia en la prensa que sí que un estudio encontró que las gallinas ponedoras están más seguras y las jaulas,3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSA82QDvzRY,Bienestar de las gallinas ponedoras y el impacto de la transición al sistemas sin jaulas,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,3:21,que en sistemas libres de Jaula o sea seguras respecto a agresión canibalismo etcétera y una investigador aquí otro ejemplo [Música] University Dice que parece que las jaulas convencionales son aún un método de alojamiento razonable para las ponedoras y que si una alternativa fuera necesaria las jaulas enriquecidas aquellas que tienen nido y unas cositas más serían la mejor alternativa para el bienestar de las gallinas No aquí no lo pone pero pero el artículo si lo dice Entonces eso tenemos entonces hay la necesidad de una métrica de bienestar animal que nos permita por ejemplo contestar a estos argumentos si es de hecho el caso a entender el impacto de políticas distintas legislación de las más varias decisiones sobre el bienestar animal de,4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSA82QDvzRY,Bienestar de las gallinas ponedoras y el impacto de la transición al sistemas sin jaulas,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,4:25,una forma muy objetiva muy transparente y muy bien envasada basada científicamente para que nosotros podamos tener respuestas para para las preguntas que que os apunté en el principio entonces Nosotros llamamos a esta métrica de woofer Food print es una huella de bienestar animal y ella es necesaria no solo para entender el impacto en el bienestar animal de forma numérica cuantitativa en términos de políticas legislación para para responder aquellas preguntas que os comenté para saber cuánto sufrimiento hay por ejemplo en cada huevo en un kilo de carne en un litro de leche en una práctica como la castración de los lechones o en cuanto sufrimiento pasa una gallina por toda su vida que vive en una jaula convencional Pero,5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSA82QDvzRY,Bienestar de las gallinas ponedoras y el impacto de la transición al sistemas sin jaulas,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,5:30,también es necesaria para entender integrar el bienestar animal en análisis sociales ambientales económicas etcétera os doy un ejemplo Bueno entonces por ejemplo en los casos donde hay una presión por sostenibilidad como en el caso de los cambios climáticos sin considerar el bienestar animal muchas veces los efectos en términos de sufrimiento Animal Son negativos por ejemplo esta noticia aquí en la prensa donde dice que consumir pollo al inglés de carne de vacuno reduce mucho la huella de carbono si es verdad Pero a qué costo No aquí posiblemente la huella de carbono baja pero la huella de sufrimiento animal sube mucho porque las gallinas tienen un Generalmente suelen ser criadas en sistemas intensivos o sea los tipos de problemas que tienen a largo de su vida son son muy grandes son mucho mucho peores que en el caso de los bueyes y además el número de individuos que es necesario,6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSA82QDvzRY,Bienestar de las gallinas ponedoras y el impacto de la transición al sistemas sin jaulas,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,6:40,para una determinada cantidad de carne de proteínas o de calorías es mucho más alto o sea necesitamos más gallinas y posiblemente con más más pollos y posiblemente con una vida más sufrida O sea sube la huella de sufrimiento animal para bajar la huella de carbono entonces para que sea posible considerar el bienestar animal en estas cuestiones porque al no haber una métrica una cuantificación del sufrimiento animal Generalmente él es ignorado no es integrado este tipo de análisis entonces tendríamos que tendríamos que entender cosas como por ejemplo para cada hectárea de tierra que no es usada o kilo de carbono que es reducido en las emisiones cuánto cambia el bienestar o el sufrimiento animal hay más sufrimiento cuanto hay menos cuánto entonces la idea del Food print projects,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSA82QDvzRY,Bienestar de las gallinas ponedoras y el impacto de la transición al sistemas sin jaulas,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,7:44,es justo eso es graficar el sufrimiento animal como resultado de diferentes desafíos problemas enfermedades lesiones deprivaciones o en diferentes sistemas de producción sistemas condiciones de vida y determinar las acciones más eficaces para mejorar su bienestar y aquí tenemos la gran cuestión porque como demostrar y cuantificar de una forma transparente y científicamente muy bien documentada el sufrimiento que los animales pasan experimentan en el proceso de producción Bueno lo que voy a hacer entonces es pasar un poco por el método que usamos para para medir eso todo y luego pasar a los resultados de la investigación sobre el impacto de la transición hacia,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSA82QDvzRY,Bienestar de las gallinas ponedoras y el impacto de la transición al sistemas sin jaulas,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,8:54,sistemas libres de Jaula bueno la huella de bienestar animal sería la cantidad de sufrimiento por unidad de producto o sea la magnitud del sufrimiento para cada huevo para cada kilo de carne litro de leche etcétera podríamos pensar también que si estamos pensando no en productos pero en prácticas o sistemas de producción sería la cantidad de sufrimiento generada por una práctica específica por ejemplo el corte de los picos de las gallinas o la cantidad de sufrimiento reducida con todos los acuerdos para la transición para sistemas libres de Jaula o lo que sea de interés y aquí os dejo un spoiler de lo que voy a hablar no para adelantar un poco pero la cantidad de sufrimiento lo medimos como el tiempo que el animal pase en,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSA82QDvzRY,Bienestar de las gallinas ponedoras y el impacto de la transición al sistemas sin jaulas,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,9:59,Estados afectivos negativos O sea no placenteros de diferentes intensidades o sea estados afectivos negativos con intensidad más moderado más alta etcétera eso en función de todas las experiencias negativas tanto físicas como psicológicas enfermedades lecciones de privaciones miedo etcétera entonces Os voy a explicar bien ahora pero os adelanto eso Entonces el sufrimiento es definido como cualquier estado afectivo negativo O sea no placentero que para simplificar lo llamamos de dolor Este dolor puede ser físico o psicológico es algo Es un término que es usado muy comúnmente una forma habitual por las personas tanto para casos de dolor físico como psicológico por ejemplo perder un hijo es uno de los peores Dolores que una persona puede puede experimentar no Entonces en este caso se habla de dolor pero es un dolor psicológico,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSA82QDvzRY,Bienestar de las gallinas ponedoras y el impacto de la transición al sistemas sin jaulas,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,11:10,aquí tenemos ejemplos de dolores físicos y psicológicos o sea cualquier sensación negativa dolores de fractura miedo pánico frío hambre se frustraciones dolores viscerales etcétera etcétera pero Y cómo medimos numéricamente este dolor no y podríamos pensar así cuál sería el peor sufrimiento el peor dolor posible bueno el peor dolor posible es el dolor más intenso más fuerte no un dolor horrible un dolor del tipo tortura o de uno quemarse vivo que es experimentado por el tiempo más largo posible o sea una persona imagínense una persona que es quemada Eternamente No es eso el peor dolor posible quizás no sé No lo sé pero hay dos elementos cuando cuando pensamos Así,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSA82QDvzRY,Bienestar de las gallinas ponedoras y el impacto de la transición al sistemas sin jaulas,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,12:22,que caracterizan el dolor uno es su duración Cuanto más largo el dolor peor no y el otro es la intensidad Cuanto más intenso el dolor Cuanto más fuerte peor también Entonces el dolor de cada una de las experiencias negativas que tenemos físicas psicológicas etcétera es caracterizado por dos elementos él tiene una duración que puede ser corta larga etcétera y una intensidad Entonces el dolor de una enfermedad puede empezar con una intensidad baja y a largo el tiempo subir la intensidad tener un pico y luego bajar o por ejemplo una fractura puede empezar con un dolor más alto y luego según evolucione la cicatrización el dolor va bajando o podemos tener dolores crónicos con picos más de intensidad más aguda más alta y y o sea muchos ejemplos son posibles,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSA82QDvzRY,Bienestar de las gallinas ponedoras y el impacto de la transición al sistemas sin jaulas,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,13:31,Entonces yo aprovecho aquí para para presentarlos el pentrreck que este sistema de notación que desarrollamos con un ejemplo del dolor asociado a una fractura del hueso de la pierna el pendrive no el padrón la evolución en este padrón quien nos envió fue un médico anestesiologista del padrón esperado para el dolor de una fractura en un paciente en una persona que está sin analgésicos Entonces por ejemplo en la primera en la primera hora no hay un pico de dolor muy alto un poco de minutos después de la fractura de una intensidad más alta y aquí en el eje horizontal tenemos el tiempo y en el vertical tenemos la intensidad luego cuando empieza la inflamación Baja un poco el dolor Pero sigue con una intensidad bastante alta por unos 34 días y según va evolucionando el proceso de,13

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSA82QDvzRY,Bienestar de las gallinas ponedoras y el impacto de la transición al sistemas sin jaulas,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,16:49,la otra categoría sería la es un dolor dolida no en este caso el dolor ya no puede ser ignorado la mayor parte del tiempo es un dolor que si fueron una persona a lo mejor la persona buscaría tomar un analgésico las actividades rutineras son parcialmente perjudicadas o sea el individuo puede seguir haciendo sus cosas pero las más importantes ya no tendrá tanta motivación para interacciones positivas no que pueden ser postergadas la capacidad cognitiva la atención al ambiente ya no es tan alta no es es perjudicada también el efecto de los fármacos sean analgésicos sean psicotrópicos ansiolíticos antidepresivos ya se puede notar Entonces es un dolor que ya se nota en el en el comportamiento bueno la tercera categoría es una,16

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSA82QDvzRY,Bienestar de las gallinas ponedoras y el impacto de la transición al sistemas sin jaulas,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,38:51,otra a otro resultado muy importante es que en los sistemas libres de Jaula Aunque el tiempo en dolor sea bastante más bajo que los sistemas con jaulas allí las fracturas de quilla son la principal preocupación el principal problema no entonces en términos relativos es el principal problema que lleva más tiempo de dolor en los sistemas libres de jaula otros resultados es que aunque este sea un problema que tiene mucha atención de la comunidad académica Y que cuando ocurre si es un problema grave pero porque su frecuencia no es tan alta el tiempo en dolor debido al interior No lo sé exactamente cómo sería en español pero el tema de que las gallinas se se pican las plumas fue bastante pero muchísimo más bajo que el tiempo en,36

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSA82QDvzRY,Bienestar de las gallinas ponedoras y el impacto de la transición al sistemas sin jaulas,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,42:08,seguramente las estimativas de diferencia entre los sistemas con jaula libre de jaulas serían incluso más grandes bueno Y finalmente me gustaría comentar brevemente de la cuestión de la mortalidad en los sistemas libre de jauland vemos mucho en la prensa y se escuchaba mucho hasta hace poco tiempo que la mortalidad en los sistemas libres de Jaula es más alta no Entonces eso era un problema para los acuerdos muchos productores tenían eso como siendo un problema para hacer la transición entonces decidimos estudiar eso Si eso es verdad como parte de este proyecto que os comenté ahora y para eso hicimos una revisión sistemática y una meta análisis lo que hicimos fue preguntar la mortalidad de ponedoras difiere entre los sistemas de alojamiento y para eso es duda estudiamos datos de mortalidad,39

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSA82QDvzRY,Bienestar de las gallinas ponedoras y el impacto de la transición al sistemas sin jaulas,Welfare Footprint Project,27 Mar 2023,45:17,todavía con un determinado sistema de alojamiento puede ser que por algunos ciclos pase por una mortalidad un poco más alta pero a largo del tiempo según adquiere la experiencia con el nuevo sistema libre de jaulas pues la mortalidad va bajando lo que vimos Es que la mortalidad puede bajar hasta un 6% en una década en los sistemas libres de Jaula o sea es posible que baje más aún Y eso es algo que la que la industria ya lo ya lo ya lo sabía porque vemos aquí por ejemplo una presentación de un representante de highline no que es una de las brits En una conferencia donde enseña aquí la mortalidad promedia en sistemas de jaulas convencionales y en sistemas libres de Jaula incluso sistemas free Range y los mejores,42

And I realized that culture is not sacred and the point of culture is to evolve and to make things better. And I think we shouldn't be afraid to criticize the parts of our culture and traditions that's failed to be moral or failed to deliver justice either towards humans or other animals. That's what progress is all about.,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,0:00,so welcome again everybody to animal think tanks webinar for this month uh today we're going to be talking about our latest narrative research and how persuasive narratives have the power to really make a difference in social movements uh by the end of this hour that I'm hoping that we're all going to be able to come away with an understanding of the power of narratives of narrative in general and an understanding of the narratives we've uncovered for animal Freedom that are persuasive I also want to be able to provide you with uh resources to use in your own campaigns in the form of our messaging guide and research report uh but before I get into that I'll begin by explaining who we are for those of you who may not be familiar with others okay so we're animal Think Tank and we're a social movement Think Tank focused on animal freedom and animal rights in the UK a little different from most I think tanks that's because we like to think of,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,1:03,ourselves as I think and do tank so we put our Research into practice within the movement and we do that with four main focus areas um our long-term strategy so thinking about potential campaigns milestones and our overall objective also what we're going to look at today particularly narrative how we change the dominant narrative about our relationship with other animals uh organization how we organize and build power within the movement and finally culture and that's the culture that we're creating uh to ensure that we're all leaders we're all supporting one another and we're all resilient enough to do this work for as long as it takes today then we're going to be talking about narrative change and story based strategy a lot of our research has been analyzing all the social movements in terms of their long-term strategy and how they,2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,2:07,change the narrative about a particular issue we've looked at many historical movements uh so far uh We've looked at the Civil Rights Movement the Indian independence movement and also more current movements like the together for yes Campaign which successfully repealed the Irish abortion ban uh we're looking at Extinction Rebellion Sunrise a youth climate group in the US uh we're looking at black lives matter as well as our own movement and campaigns uh such as the Breitling sea campaign and that successfully ended the live export from that town for those uh who aren't familiar I'm going to be talking now about story based strategy and that's a framework that recognizes that strategy and narrative go hand in hand so we need to have a long-term strategy for how we can change dominant harmful narratives in society and we also need to be thinking,3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,3:09,about the stories that we're telling within our campaigns and thinking about what's called the action logic this is essentially thinking about how would a passerby interpret any action what would they understand when they see that as the story that we're trying to communicate for example if they see people liberating injured animals from a factory farm uh that's telling quite a simple and quite a powerful story but if they see a lot of people blocking a road they might not really understand why they're doing it you know what the logic is of that action how that that sort of fits in narratively though it's a really useful framework for us to be thinking about when we're planning actions and campaigns and thinking about how we communicate a really good example of a campaign that used story-based strategy to really good effect is the freedom to marry campaign that's on screen right now and that was the uh us campaign for marriage equality,4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,4:13,and it's been a big uh inspiration for us at ATT oh Tech again is being difficult for us I'm afraid aha perfect so the freedom to marry campaign had a winning strategy they knew that they needed to legitimize gay love and uh that to do that they needed to legalize gay marriage so they created a road map for how they'd win marriage equality in all 50 U.S states the problem was that they were yet to find their winning narrative over years of campaigning uh polling barely changed the U.S public would they were just not in favor of marriage equality in fact uh they were told by an experienced uh and respected U.S pollster campaigners were told you'll never see gay marriage in your lifetime but they didn't let that deter them because they knew they had a solid strategy in place and they needed to,5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,5:21,understand why people were opposed to marriage equality so through doing public research they found that their own Communications were holding them back people didn't really understand why gay people wanted to get married when they already had civil Partnerships in a lot of people's minds it was it was Conjuring up this very legal frame and many believed it was just to sort of get tax breaks and talking about um tax breaks was actually something they'd been saying in their own comms so it was sort of inadvertently uh sort of strengthening that narrative what they hadn't been saying up until this point was why gay people wanted to get married and that was to sort of you know the reason everybody wanted wants to get married to officially celebrate their love and commitment uh like absolutely everyone else in society could so uh with that in mind they began to test new ways of framing the issue of marriage equality to see what would most persuade people to support it and this,6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,6:25,is what they found they shifted from the right to marry to the freedom to marry so just a simple linguistic change they stopped talking about Justice and rights and started talking about love and family they move their messaging away from the Discrimination of gay people towards messaging about the celebration of love they stopped talking about gay marriage and they started talking about marriage equality and in doing so they framed it um they they moved it from Being Framed as a minority issue to a societal issue that affects all of us through talking about these shared values of love uh of freedom and love family equality they were able to reframe the issue so that it was relevant to absolutely everybody not just the LGBT community,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,7:27,uh they expanded the frame uh by sharing stories of conservative fathers wanting to walk their lesbian daughters down the aisle of religious parents wanting their gay son to marry the love of his life of children wanting to wanting their same-sex parents to be able to celebrate their love of everyday people changing their opinions uh about marriage equality and through these stories people were able to identify with a range of different Messengers reinforcing that this was an issue that affected everybody um I'd really recommend that um you guys go away and check out the freedom tamari website because to sort of see their ads in action because it really is effective and there's a lot that can Inspire us in our own Communications um not only did they effectively use shared values to persuade people they spoke to aspirations as well of the type of person that people wanted to see,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,8:31,themselves as and the type of society that they wanted to live in like this aspirational idea as the founder of the freedom to marry campaign said we turn this from what do you think about gay people to what do you think about your own values and I think this is a really important quote for us to reflect on as Animal Advocates we need to make the issue animal Freedom personally and socially relevant in the same way that freedom to marry campaign made uh marriage equality personally and socially relevant and we need to make animal Freedom an issue that's impossible for people to dismiss or disregard so uh here at ADT we're currently doing a lot of research into what shared values and aspirational identities are most persuasive and we'll be sharing those research findings as we have them because it's currently proving quite a tricky thing to pin down I'm going to read this quote out again we turn this from what do you think about gay people to what do you think,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,9:36,about your own values just bear that in mind and it worked they won after changing their narrative they want all 50 US states in just 11 years after being told you'll never see gay marriage in your lifetime and this campaign that was rooted in shared values in shared aspirations continues to win worldwide from you know from this this ad alone this love wins um you can see how they framed it as a win for everybody not just a win for gay people because everybody wins from living in a society that respects and values love in all its forms and that's how we need to communicate our vision for animal Freedom this is something that's going to benefit all of us not just other animals and here at animal think tank we believe that this is key to how we will win I've spoken a little bit made a little reference to some of the narrative research we've been doing to better,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,10:45,understand people's attitudes and beliefs and opportunities and barriers um we don't want to sort of reinvent the wheel because there's already a lot of great research out there both from our own movement and from other movements so we're compiling reviews of relevant research as well as conducting our own we're conducting interviews and focus groups with various segments of the UK population we're running large-scale surveys uh we're conducting interviews and we're doing continuous message testing to better understand what resonates and what doesn't so I'll take you through the findings of one of these studies now um mapping the dominant narrative narratives held by the UK public and this was really to lay the groundwork for all our research we wanted to identify the dominant narratives held by the UK public because understanding The Narrative landscape is the first step to,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,11:46,changing it we aim to understand the main beliefs and attitudes towards animals in the UK those that are helpful to our movement and also the harmful ones that held us back and finally we also wanted to get an idea of which narratives were dominant currently in the UK so to do this we asked 500 participants who were representative of the UK population 100 questions and then we used the results uh of of this to measure the relative dominance of six main cultural narratives that emerged I'll take you through them now so these are cultural narratives the ones that had the highest public agreement levels so the first one which I think will all be uh quite happy to see is sentientism so this is an attitude of respect and recognition for other animals cognitive and emotional abilities as well as their,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,12:47,rights um and we should find it quite encouraging that that has 92 percent of agreement with our participants representative the UK population and I think while it's strange just to us that so many people can hold a belief that contradicts the way society as a whole operates we should also be aware and take Hope from this that uh this is a core this core belief in sentience is a basis for us to build upon the second one we found and a much more harmful narrative and one that's pushed by the industry is that of economy so the perceived uh economic importance of animal agriculture Industries particularly for sustaining rural communities people are very very sold particularly in the UK they're sold on the idea of British farming and this like imaginary pastoral Idol this sort of thing that we're you know told us soon we're told from as soon as we sing Old MacDonald Had a Farm we we,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,13:48,experienced this and that was also a very high percentage of agreement 87 but not as high as sentientism so you know a a good a good thing even though it's a harmful narrative is still pretty high the third one was welfare and this is um a sort of well-intentioned support for more compassionate treatments of animals and more regulations to ensure Animal Welfare in farming um which is a sort of convenient myth for the industry that's used to sort of assuage people's guilts uh the animals in the system have good lives before Slaughter and this has sort of an 86 agreement level um moving on the other three narratives uh moral the idea of a moral lifestyle so this is people who endorse veganism and vegetarianism as a beneficial and,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,14:53,ethically preferable lifestyle and that still has 71 of agreement for all our participants so there's an understanding that eating animals is not the right thing to do uh even if they still do it themselves it's quite a positive thing to see uh number five was uh justification so we're probably all familiar with this the uh the belief that eating other animals is acceptable because it's normal natural necessary and nice the four ends um it's probably the narrative that we vegans come up or you know most of us I assume are vegans then we probably encounter most regularly among family and friends um it's surprising to me that it's not as dominant as some of the other narratives but it is still quite prevalent at 70 percent and then finally the final dominant narrative uh this is one that we're going to recognize as well as a pervasive narrative anthropocentrism so the view that humans are unique more,15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,15:54,valuable at the top of the hierarchy and that animals can be exploited by humans as a superior species um it should give us hope though I think that when people actually sit down and think about it if we think at the beginning we were talking about 92 percent of agreement for sentientism anthropocentrism when people sit down and think about it only has 50 agreement it might guide a lot of their actions because it's instinctive but logically it doesn't hold as much sway so after we mapped these dominant narratives um we could move on to the next stage now we have this basis of understanding of the the landscape of people's uh mental models when it came to animals and um then we could move on to identifying the best narratives to change people's minds and these are the most persuasive narratives we found so far,16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,16:54,so animal abilities this is the idea that animals have or inspiring abilities or intelligence as well as rich in our lives so it's kind of like the sentience narrative that's already subscribed to plus um it's uh has a focus on inspiring or and respect uh social progress number two that animal freedom is the next step in our progress as a society um it's almost the idea that animal freedom is inevitable you may as well jump on board because we're always on this historical trajectory towards a fairer a more compassionate world and thirdly morality so the idea that it's morally right uh to support animal freedom but importantly morality framed in the positive so it's morally right to support animal Freedom rather than you are morally wrong for eating meat seems to have a positive effect on um pro-animal sentiment so to identify these narratives we used a process called message testing which I,17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,18:00,mentioned earlier as one of our work streams in narrative we came up with a lot of different messages pulling on lots of different narratives and then participant read our message or they watched a video um of our message and then answered a questionnaire and these are the three narratives that we found were more likely to result in people saying that they would sign a petition to end factory farming and they all increased per animal uh sentiment with statistical significance and that's why we recommend them in our messaging guide but they aren't new narratives they have been used in our movement before but not in a concerted or strategic way so I'm going to take you through some examples of each now first of all animal abilities uh here are some stories that already sort of speak to that so when people understand other animals and can see them as individuals they care more deeply about them so some of these examples some of you may recognize Esther the Wonder Pig here,18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,19:04,on the left um she's she's shown how each pig is unique each Pig has their own personality how they feel uh how they relate to themselves and to other people they have particular likes and dislikes um and there are loads of stories changing uh loads of stories of people saying that they've changed how they related to pigs as a result of Esther um below west of there uh the dodo this is a popular website and YouTube channel that um is really good at sharing uh inspiring stories of other animals which helps to in the dodo's words make caring about animals a viral cause and many of their videos do go viral like you you've if you've been on the internet at all you will have probably come across a Dodo video Even if you haven't recognized them they're receiving millions of views um we also see pulling from the animal abilities uh narrative Anthology books such as these uh two great ones from,19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,20:06,Jonathan balcombe so Superfly and what a fish knows uh they show the incredible abilities of animals particularly those that are sort of written off as the least sentient or undervalued insects and fish um who were sort of like classically thought of as as not particularly intelligent but balcombe is really good at engaging people and explaining their you know how their unique abilities are or inspiring to humans um many of you as well might be familiar with the oscar-winning Netflix documentary my octopus teacher on the top right here and that followed a relationship between a an unnamed female octopus and a male diver um and it was very effective very worth a watch because it framed The Octopus as somebody unique uh she was very wise and who had much to teach her human her human cousin her human friend,20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,21:09,and then finally here um on the bottom right the people with the VR headsets uh this was animal equality uh they used the VR headsets to show people the perspective of animals trapped in factory farms and from the reactions just to the people in this picture you can see that it had like a really profound impact on people because they asked them to look through the eyes of another and imagine how they would feel in that situation so all of these are just a few examples of the animal abilities narratives that already exist and our research shows that this is a narrative we really need to be amplifying as a movement because it helps people connect with animals in a much deeper way secondly the social progress narrative um the you know this is champing animal Freedom uh not just being about other animals it's about our shared commitment to advancing Justice as a society uh some of you might have seen the BBC mockumentary here,21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,22:12,um Carnage which was written by Simon Amstel it shows a quite a um optimistic future where animal exploitation is a thing of the past and Society is in the process of coming to terms with Han or other animals used to be treated it was um it's a really clever and funny way to show our future vision and speaks to this idea that animal freedom is the way forward towards a more compassionate Society and then underneath Carnage our friends at Pax fauna and they're a social movement think tank in the US who will be doing a webinar with us next time if you'd like to pop along to that one too and they they um found in their public research that narratives about Society evolving together were really persuasive and then finally on the right here the vegan Society created an ad a few years ago that referenced um other social movements so you can see the the suffragettes referenced here and how at that time change seemed so,22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,23:20,radical and that one day by extension animal Freedom won't seem so radical either and our third narrative the morality narrative and that's the you know the idea that the rights and freedoms of other animals are an ethical imperative for us to support um the animal Interfaith Alliance here on the left uh specifically comes at the issue from a faith-based perspective so they really pull on this uh morality narrative particularly um the idea of extending the Golden Rule do unto others uh beyond our own species uh similarly uh Peter Singer makes a very influential argument for animal Freedom uh in animal Liberation based on the idea that our moral decision making should give equal consideration of interest to all beings the interest of all beings not just humans um and then finally speciesism the movie uh they really tackled this issue head on um they asked people the difficult,23
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,24:28,questions there's like interviews with a lot of people um it asks difficult questions about their own morality you can see from the picture here that it plays on ideas of Justice with the man and the chicken as having equal moral weight on the scale definitely worth a watch so they were the three narratives that we've identified as persuasive but there are also other persuasive narratives I've said this before but one of the things we don't want to do is reinvent the wheel so we wanted to also mention some persuasive narratives that work across many social movements and are appropriate for us to use in the animal Freedom Movement that we accessed via uh public interest Research Center so the first one is the idea of unequal by Design so um a narrative that presents the system as designed to benefit a select few within built with with power imbalances,24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,25:27,as a as a feature not a bug of these societies it's deliberately built in uh number two a bigger us so this is a shift away from us versus them thinking towards a more an inclusive ideal of solidarity it really sort of widens the circle of compassion to uh all beings um you know it can be um it can be race it can be um uh sexuality gender identity but also uh species too and then finally citizens um this is a the idea of a the idea that societal shift is possible through Collective action not just individual change so this really gets us out of a consumer mindset and thinking about ourselves as a citizen not a consumer it really challenges the idea for all social movements that we vote with our wallet rather than taking direct action,25
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,26:36,so if you want more information on how to implement these narratives and craft messages um and how to leverage the shares the shared values that speak to people's best selves then our messaging guide will be really useful to you uh it goes into a lot more detail than I'm able to today about these narratives and how they can be used uh we're intending it as a reference tool for you to have in your arsenal when you're creating messages and you know crafting narratives to your campaign the research report that's linked there as well also digs a lot deeper into how we came to the conclusions we did so all the facts and figures that came out of our studies that you know I can't recall for top of my head today but um I swear they're all there and they're they're very interesting and I'll also come back to this QR code at the end so there'll be time to scan it later so here's a little peek now on what we'll be looking at over the next few months will be uh Research into the,26
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,27:44,start of 2024 um at the end of this year uh we'll be looking at what moves people to care about other animals what kind of people are more likely to care about animal issues as well uh we'll also be looking at what issues and practices people are more accepting of and what they're more opposed to we'll be looking at how we frame ourselves so values aspirational identities as motivating factors for uh taking action uh how we frame other animals as well and or particularly how we frame our relationship with other animals our research is always evolving so we hope to come back to you with more updated advice that will be even more targeted as more and more testing takes place with narratives that are even more effective once we've encountered them and yeah we hope you'll watch this space as well as focusing um on story based strategy a big part of our work is collaboration,27
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,28:54,um we know that we can only win animal Freedom if we have a unified movement that's sharing ideas and working together and that's why we run annual messaging events uh our last one in February this year uh brought together over 52 individuals from ngos uh Grassroots groups academics uh Faith groups journalists photographers filmmakers storytellers every sort of like Walk of Life we're also collaborating with academics to share ideas and bring in insights um we also consult with others in the movement to gather their knowledge and expertise and we run roundtables as well to facilitate facilitate to facilitate strategic discussions um and the hope is that with collaborating with many different organizations both within our movement and outside our movement um we will be able to sort of come together and really make a change here and uh finally running workshops to,28
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,29:58,train people in story based strategy again watch this space for uh information on that and finally we need this unified story based strategy it doesn't matter if we have the best strategy all the best story we can only create lasting change through working together as a movement we need all three of these pieces strategy narrative and unity I'm going to read this quote one more time just a reminder of those words that the US pollster told freedom to marry campaigners you'll never see gay marriage in your lifetime yet they did it in 11 years through unified story based strategy we know that we have a long road ahead of us to get to animal freedom but if we work together if we unite behind a long-term strategy and using persuasive narratives that we have been shown to move people then we can create radical change just like they did we can show that through achieving animal freedom everybody wins,29
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,31:09,so I hope you found this inspiring uh if you'd like to find out more about the work we're doing you can check our website you can email us you can sign up for our narrative newsletter via our website and hear about our latest research and upcoming events first um before we move into questions I have the QR code for our message guide and research report again um so you can find out more so please feel free to to scam and um I'll leave this up now and I'll move into sort of um q a if anybody has anything to ask do you want to start with a job Sylvia raise her hands um should we have one from the chat and then one from Sofia if that's okay oh okay so the first I'm going back uh up there was a first question by Christa um do you have a plan for contemplating other countries and cultures I don't,30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,32:11,know if people hear me um okay so do we have a plan for contemplating other cultures so yes we are a sort of UK based organization so most of our research will be uh focused on the UK but we are collaborating with narrative organizations uh across the world uh perhaps Spawner in the US um to name one but also to kind of like seeding narrative thinking across the world as well and we will hopefully be sort of sharing information on how to carry out testing to get the winning narratives for I'll stop sharing now how to get the winning narratives that work in each specific uh nationality so the the narratives that work in the UK might not work in Australia for example but we may be able to sort of give each other a steer on what to test and how to test I hope that answers that question Sylvia did you is that yes and so I have none necessarily a,31
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,33:14,question I also have stuff to add only because I really enjoyed why you were presenting and I'm a sociologist but I also graduated last year animal behavior welfare and conservation science and my research paper was called to be or not to be a person an inter-species theory of justice and this is exactly what I focused on how can we declare animals a legal person within the UK and what is also the public opinion so I created a public consultation which was sent to UK based companies as stakeholders as well as Citizens and residents of the UK and I have identified some of the narratives that you guys have identified and also the year before I did another research which was in anthrozoology and it wasn't exactly about the social Framing and the narratives we create around animals last,32
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,34:18,year when it came to the law I actually created the sorry the Declaration of fundamental rights of non-human persons just as an example in my public consultation for people what they could experience in case we do get to declare animals human non-human persons one of the things that came through was the fact that people is not necessarily only about narratives how can we support people practically to get to that point and this is one of the things that I think is very very important once we start cycling and getting together in in resolving these kind of issues we need to get to the psychology and sociology of the movements and then be able not only to create the narratives but maybe drawing stakeholders and actors that could support us with practical practicalities of how to do this not just the words behind it yeah yeah narrative is one piece of the puzzle very you know yeah thank you very much,33
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,35:29,for that Sylvia that's uh that's really interesting you know please um I'd be very interested to read your research so you know hit me up on LinkedIn would love to read that and I'll pass it on to our public research and testing team I think they'll find that very interesting too thank you Emily is there yeah Maria is asking uh is raising your hand hi thank you so much thank you so much for your presentation it was super interesting uh I'm Maria I'm a researcher and teacher of strategic communication here in London University in Sweden and um it I founded your presentation really interesting because you suggest that campaigns should tackle the individuality of the sentient beings the the uniqueness of every individual and I was researching um I was doing almost the um contrary work I was researching on the narrative strategies of the um animal exploitation Industries,34
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,36:35,and specifically the dairy industry and one of my foundings was that one of the main strategies that they use is precisely this like the opposite treating the animals exactly as not individuals nonsense at the end not unique so it's very interesting that our research emerges here some somehow it well it is very interesting isn't it I think is it as it shows that the most dominant narrative here in the UK was sentientism it's you know that that's I think that the industry has had to to do a lot of unlearning has had to promote a lot of unlearning to allow this to happen but still you know we have that Baseline understanding that is there for us to build on so yeah it is really interesting how these things we've looked at like two sides of the coin there that to to fix the problem or what seems to fix the problem of um of people's,35
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,37:38,um perceptions there is to just kind of rebuild from that basis that has been eroded So yeah thank you do you have any more in the chat Emily if I mean um there's I mean I mean but it could be questions certainly she was saying I wonder how much the prevalence of certain narratives vary by religion age gender Etc oh so do I that's something that we are hoping to get into um within the next year to couple of years um I'm particularly interested in developing so my my background to give you a little bit of context is marketing and um I'm really interested in developing psychographics um for sort of supporters and detractors for animal Freedom so like what kind of person um agrees what kind of person doesn't what kind of person is persuadable as well so yeah that's definitely definitely on our radar,36
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,38:41,and then there's like lots of comments but no particular questions in the chats if anybody would like to stick their hand up um you can ask anything uh there's a new question in the chat you attribute the success of freedom to narrate to the narrative change but how can you be sure this was the main cause it wasn't the main cause but it was the thing that shifted the the Zeitgeist if that makes sense it wasn't so there was decades and Decades of excellent campaigning but in the Gay Liberation movement that cannot be you know it was which formed an excellent Foundation but when they reached that that sort of point of not changing Minds it was changing the narrative that gave it that that push into the sort of larger public Arena of agreement if that makes sense but yeah we have potato raising his hand,37
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,39:46,hi hi everyone uh my question is regarding uh animal rebellion and they have been using a narrative about uh you know uh love for animals or UK is a land of animal lovers which kind of uh is a bit of deceiving message because you know when you when you look at the right space perspective you don't need to love somebody to respect their right and I'm not sure if if this is the kind of narrative which because you know animal Rebellion is more like a uh prominent animal organizations right now in UK which has been doing a lot of direct action and other things and introdu you know calling UK the land of animal lovers is kind of a bit strange it's it's a well-known phrase in the UK like we we often describe ourselves as a nation of animal lovers it's a bit of a it's a bit of a stock phrase that we use so I can see why they've chosen that,38
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,40:51,particular narrative to try and pull on because it pulls on the British national identity but you know obviously to us it can seem a little bit um a little bit of a strange thing to say considering what goes on in the UK um I so we've done some research into identities and one of the identities that we looked at was um if you appeal to people's identities as an animal lover does that shift their uh pro-animal sentiment and we didn't find any conclusive results either way we didn't see any major change we didn't see any major detraction it was just versus the control message it wasn't statistically different so that's not to say that it's not an effective narrative to pull on it may just be that we didn't encounter it being so maybe the way that we Leverage The Narrative wasn't particularly good you know maybe maybe if we were to write another message written differently it would have an effect so I you know I don't want to say that um the animal Rising is doing the,39
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,41:56,wrong thing because I you know I simply don't have that information but yeah it's it's interesting yeah I I agree with you but I guess I always come out from the perspective of yeah you don't have to love someone to respect their rights but if animal lover if leveraging that identity is is what shifts public opinion then I would probably leverage it before I sort of made the point about rights if that makes sense I hope that makes yeah I thought uh I mean coming further on that for an example if uh you know because you mentioned about the unity in the in the movement in uh and the other organizations uh don't agree with that it's of the animal how would you have Unity um so by sharing that it works hopefully by being able to show other organizations,40
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,42:58,that if we sort of we don't all have to be this is the thing with narrative we don't all have to be literally saying the same thing we we have a um an idiom here in the UK um singing from the same hymn sheet which means that everybody's saying the same thing and starting the same ideas when it comes to narrative I don't want everybody singing from the same hymn sheet I don't want us all saying the same thing I want you know we in narrative believe that we have to be sort of in the same house of worship that's it just in the same church in the same building as long as we're pulling on narratives that work that are applicable to a great number of circumstances and a great number of messages that don't all have to be saying the exact same words in the exact same way we will be able to we'll hopefully be able to shift public opinion does that answer thank you thank you so much thank you,41
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,43:59,any other questions [Music] let me have a look it's a little difficult for me to check yeah there's no hurry up with a link to a research video [Music] or research oh thank you for that Maria that's that's very useful thank you I'll take a look at that later okay why well no no okay learning questions so unless we have any more I'm just going to share my screen one more time to plug uh next month's webinar where uh you'll be able to hear it from um come on there we go so next time we'll be having a guest speaker in this webinar slot so this will be Aiden from Pax fauna um so he'll be uh presenting his,42
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2dfrrrj98,Narrative Revolution: A Game- Changer for Animal Freedom,Animal Think Tank,28 Sept 2023,44:58,findings from years of research on public opinion and narrative in the US um and animal advocacy in the US so looking at how we solve the problem of animal advocacy being seen as emotionally manipulative by the public which is obviously a bit of a conundrum in that it's inherently an emotional issue yet that's a an accusation that gets leveraged a lot that we're being emotionally manipulative so um Aiden will be talking about that and his research we hope you'll join us there's another QR code there but um you'll also be able to find this on our LinkedIn uh on our website and on our event right so thank you very much everybody um it's been great to talk to you today um yeah thank you very much have a have a lovely evening where's lovely meeting you and thank you thank you Sylvia,43

Essentially, I became a plant-based lifestyler first, because I was terrified of dying. The more I got involved and the more that I realized that, well, you see some pretty bad videos, and the way animals are treated, and it's horrific.

My perception of veganism had always been that it was like tasteless and no flavor and just vegetables, and that's what a lot of people thought. So I wanted to introduce, you know, these different types of foods to black communities.

What's usually passed down are the eating habits. When I first went vegan, I learned that most public schools are funded by the meat and dairy industry.

Who's putting this information into the schools and to our children and telling us that the only way you can get protein is through an animal?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6nPqdLTfPY,Why Charles Darwin Would Be Vegan,Generation Vegan,9 Oct 2020,0:22,to our fellow creatures and initially i thought well the answer to to do this is just to set up this huge network of nature reserves and if we could do that we will solve the mass extinction species and so for the first 10 years that's what i did i mean i'm not perfect but i'm getting better but i can tell you,2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6nPqdLTfPY,Why Charles Darwin Would Be Vegan,Generation Vegan,9 Oct 2020,0:45,this is the best thing i've ever done in my life and one journalist says to me well it's all very well you're doing this this this lovely conservation work but but what exactly is your impact on the environment and and i thought well i should try and find out vegetables have got 31 as a footprint,3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6nPqdLTfPY,Why Charles Darwin Would Be Vegan,Generation Vegan,9 Oct 2020,1:02,cheese has got 3 000 so it's basically 100 times when i did my first footprint i actually to my absolute shock i realized that i wasn't 1.5 planets which was the average of humanity i was six planets which was even worse than the average australian average australians five planets the average americans four,4

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6nPqdLTfPY,Why Charles Darwin Would Be Vegan,Generation Vegan,9 Oct 2020,1:43,it's actually incredibly sensible because we've only got one planet i mean did i miss a meeting so what are we living in a fall planet lifestyle or my ridiculous six planet lifestyle i was a big meat eater and i thought that was fine but once i started measuring my footprint i realized that meat was actually one of the biggest problems we,6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6nPqdLTfPY,Why Charles Darwin Would Be Vegan,Generation Vegan,9 Oct 2020,2:07,have to solve verifiable evidence indicates meat consumption globally will double in the next 35 years and if that occurs so much forest will have to be cut down around the world that we're going to cause a mass extinction species within the next hundred years,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6nPqdLTfPY,Why Charles Darwin Would Be Vegan,Generation Vegan,9 Oct 2020,2:25,and we cannot let that happen my average food is cereal with sire vegetarian sandwiches three big ones and in the evening pasta or rice with veggies and tofu and beans and that's about a quarter of a planet uh my footprint just for the food if i switch out to a more typical,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6nPqdLTfPY,Why Charles Darwin Would Be Vegan,Generation Vegan,9 Oct 2020,2:51,western diet i would go cereal with milk maybe tuna fish sandwich and have a juicy steak in the evening with a couple of veggies on the side and that is really changes everything suddenly blows out to 2.5 planets my normal vegan diet is 10 times less than that typical western,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6nPqdLTfPY,Why Charles Darwin Would Be Vegan,Generation Vegan,9 Oct 2020,3:16,diet if my great great grandfather charles darwin was alive today i think he would be vegan he was driven by evidence he would conclude that so we can all lead healthy and compassionate lives it's imperative for the 21st century to become the vegan century [Music],10

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,0:05,good afternoon everyone my name is Cynthia shook it's my pleasure to be discussing this topic with you on why Animal Welfare science must look at time so as we all know time is at the heart of how any living creature experiences life affective States whether positive or negative will matter more or less depending on their density but also critically on their duration so it's not,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,0:34,the same thing to be in a state of hunger just before a meal or for weeks months or a lifetime and the same goes for any other effective experience that an animal may have such as cold fear hunger bored on the pain of a fracture frustration from the deprivation of motivated behaviors and and so on so to give you an example that is closer to us we can see here the description of,2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,1:04,the pain of a bone fracture as narrated by someone who has gone through this experience and we can see that the impact of the Spain on the patient is very much a function of the intensity of the pain in the vertical axis and the duration of the pain on the horizontal axis so there's very intense pain immediately in the hour after the fracture then somewhat less intense pain,3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,1:33,during the inflammation period but still it's painful then the pain gradually subsides as the callus starts forming and the bone is remodeled now the same logic also applies to animals we have here the case of a naggling hand that has just suffered a Cubone fracture and the impact of this fracture on the welfare of the hand is,4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,1:59,also a function of the intensity of the pain and the duration of the pain so we can expect a very similar pattern to what we observed in the case of the human patient we could also have another example for example a hen that suffered an acute fatal episode of egg peritonitis that got infected and the Hand dies from septic shock so in this case there's some discomfort in the,5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,2:24,beginning before infection sets in then pain gets very very high during sepsis it's a very painful condition and then subsides abruptly as the hand gets into septic shock and dies so obviously effective states are modulated by a number of factors but intensity and time are key factors so we can think of what would be the worst suffering in the world and one good,6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,2:57,answer to this would be that with the longest possible duration and the highest possible intensity now time-based metrics of well-being haven't been used much in the Animal Welfare Sciences but they have been used a lot in other areas such as Global Health from where we come from one of them for example is the Dali disability adjusted life years which measures the,7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,3:24,time of healthy life lost to disease or to premature death so for example here we have the case of a person from birth to death Which experiences in the red squares here some episodes of disease and in the last about the person dies at six years of age so 10 years before the average life expectancy for this demographic group and the dolly here in this case is the,8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,3:55,measure of the ears lost to disease weighted by a disability weight is which how much the disease disabled made the person unhealthy so five years here in a diseased state with a disability weight of 50 percent would mean 2.5 years lost this is calculated for all the disease episodes over the life of an average person with this disease and the dolly,9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,4:25,here is simply the sum of the ears lost to disease so 2.5 1.5 and 3.5 which is 7.5 and the years lost to premature death due to the disease so Dallas 17.5 years and by having this Universal metric which is time you can compare very different conditions injuries diseases any problems you want to look at in terms of the time they cause the person to lose,10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,4:59,to the disease you're analyzing you can compare different age groups different locations different you know demographics evolution of the burden of the diseases over time and and set priorities for interventions for funding for research Etc so with that in mind we understand that in the Animal Welfare Sciences a biologically meaningful metric of,11
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,5:26,welfare of suffering that is amenable to comparisons a universal metrics such as a time-based measure is needed to quantify and compare the impact of very different welfare problems policies living conditions um to enable integrating Animal Welfare quantitatively into social environmental and economic analysis and to raise awareness about how much suffering is,12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,5:56,embedded in each unit of animal products in each kilo in each liter in each egg with a metric that anyone can understand that is not abstract So based on our experience in global Health we developed the cumulative paint framework which measures the time in unpleasant negative effective States and we use the term pain,13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,6:25,as a shorthand for any felt negative effective state so time in pain of different intensities enables comparing very different outcomes very different hazards through their effects in terms of the time the animal spends in pain or the average member of a population spends in pain for intensity we use four discrete categories of pain intensity from,14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,6:55,Annoying which is simply a discomfort to excruciating these categories are defined by tight criteria I don't worry I will not read this for you but mostly the level of disruption in terms of behavior this is one criteria the expected effect of drugs painkillers psychotropics on Behavior effects in terms of attention cognitive performance and so on so you can you can read the,15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,7:25,year definitions in the website if you're interested and we have a notation system which we call paint track where we make hypo hypothesis about the duration of the pain associated with a welfare Challenge and the intensity of the pain explicit in this notation system so for example here we have a paint track for the case of a Cubone fracture in lay hands and,16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,7:52,the probability that the pain belongs to each of these categories of pain intensity is informed by multiple indicators so Behavior indicators the effect of of drugs on on pain and behavior and and physiological markers physiology Immunology knowledge of the neurological system associated with the structure that was affected tests of preference of motivation uh evolutionary,17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,8:24,reasoning on the Adaptive importance of the pain of that negative effective State associated with the hazard evidence from closely related species in terms of pain and so on so we we have this hypothesis here with uncertainty intervals and the better the evidence the narrower our interval of uncertainty both for duration and for the probability that pain belongs to each of,18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,8:55,these categories of intensity foreign and once we have the hypothesis for intensity and duration they are converted to time in Pain by simply multiplying this probability here by the duration of the segment and once you add up all the time in pain of the different intensities you have the cumulative time in pain due to a fracture in this case,19
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,9:23,we have applied this framework to answer a number of questions regarding the welfare of egg laying hands the results are available in this book and questions such as would it be possible that due to the greater frequency of challenges such as aggression fractures infectious diseases in cage-free operations welfare of the hands would be worse as compared to caged operations or even if welfare,20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,9:48,is better in catering environments how much better is it in the case of broilers we ask questions such as how much suffering can be averted by setting genetic limits to the growth rate of Broiler chickens or would a longer life in the case of slower growing breeds under conditions that are still better but far from ideal lead to more suffering because the chickens live,21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,10:15,a longer life and to answer these questions we investigated a number of welfare challenges that lay hands and Broiler chickens go through lameness Behavior deprivation fractures injuries um thermal stress cardiovascular conditions infectious diseases and so on and in doing so and because we had to look at both indicators of intensity of,22
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,10:41,the pain and duration of the pain it became very clear to us that very little attention in the welfare Sciences has been paid to understanding the duration of the welfare challenges that the animals undergo so how long they last the timing of onset of this challenges so when they emerge and the evolution or clinical evolution of these challenges so how quickly they progress and how,23
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,11:09,they progress there is very very little information for many of the welfare challenges that are commonly investigated in the welfare Sciences so in this table we have some examples for example regarding egg peritonitis which is both a chronic conditions in survivors and a fatal condition is the most important production disease in poultry uh there's very little to no,24

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,12:06,extremely extremely painful condition but it's a neglected condition in the year Animal Welfare Sciences we don't know the time it takes for the hand to die from sepsis one law of Consciousness happens in terms of Cubone fractures in laying hands the duration of pain the clinical evolution of pain you know inflammatory case callus formation and Etc we don't know much about it in terms,26
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,12:35,of injurious packing ferrocannibalistic attacks vent packing bouts we don't know in the case for example of a fatal cannibalistic attack how long it takes for the victim to die so what is the typical duration of of this attacks we we don't know the frequency of the spouts the duration of the spouse has it like a few seconds a few minutes many minutes,27
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,13:03,um in terms of gate impairing conditions lameness when does it happen I know it's a multifactorial condition but we don't know much about the duration of each of the phases of lameness how long each Broiler for example spans in each gate score before it progresses to the next one the same goes for cardiac abnormalities the main cause of death so a sudden death,28
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,13:33,ascitis and the expression of motivated behaviors what are the changes in the time budget in the over the production cycle as the hand gets old as the hand or the broiler gets older so there are many research gaps associated with the time spent in different conditions when conditions emerge how long they last how quickly they progress and these caps are not only present in,29
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,14:04,terms of poultry research but also in other areas of Animal Welfare research research on pigs fish Etc and it's very very critical to understand these questions related to time to Onset to duration I'll give you an example for example we know that when we have less risk factors for a disease let's say for cardiovascular diseases for diabetes Etc the onset of the disease is likely later,30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,14:33,on in life so in the case of production animals we farm animals we have the later onset of chronic disease and injuries relative to slaughter age when you have better genetics for example when you have a slower growing breed and with the later onset of disease relative to the slaughter age you're going to have a shorter time spent in pain until Slaughter in the case of,31
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,15:02,chronic conditions because the disease emerged much later in life you're gonna have less time for disease progression so what you what this means is that the disease will probably be less severe it will reach it will not reach the most severe stages and as a consequence less individuals because it takes more time to for the disease to emerge less individuals will develop the problem so,32
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,15:31,you have reduced duration reduced intensity less severe disease and reduce prevalence and as a consequence reduce suffering so understanding the effect of genetics for example or environmental conditions on the onset on the timing of onset of disease is created in the sense and although the idea is not to to present the results of the research conducted uh with this method uh some,33
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,16:01,very interesting findings emerge when we look at the effects of you know when we're considered the duration of the welfare challenges in the uh in Animal Welfare analysis so for example estimates show that chronic hunger in fast-growing female breeders Broiler breeders is possibly the greatest source of physical pain for any foreign chicken including hands and Broiler chickens and,34
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyLF9l2_4k,Animal Welfare Science Must Look at Time!,Welfare Footprint Project,1 Jul 2023,16:27,the case sepsis for example and the diseases leading to sepsis such as egg peritonitis in breeders and laying hands is possibly the greatest source of excruciating pain in in these animals so many interesting things emerge when we take time duration into account so thank you so much for taking the time to to watch this talk and we are available for for questions,35
