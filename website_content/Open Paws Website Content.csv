When an LM was trained on these outputs it achieved significantly better results on much fewer parameters and generalised better than LMs trained on human feedback data. This shows that distilling synthetic data to the core knowledge produces much better results than using “raw” synthetic data (i.e. exported conversations with a system like ChatGPT)",text,46

For example,this papershowed that Arabic and English speakers view time as moving in different directions, whereas Arabic speakers view it as moving from right to left and English see it move from left to right. If you were to translate concepts around how time maps onto space using only word-for-word machine translations you would miss this nuance, which shows one small example of why we must use text written by native speakers to make our database multilingual, and don’t rely exclusively on machine translations.",text,54
https://www.openpaws.ai/research-and-reports/literature-review-on-developing-artificial-intelligence-to-advocate-for-animal-rights,"There’s a hypothesis calledLinguistic Relativitythat suggests language influences and shapes the worldview of it’s speakers and their cognition, and whilst the strongest version of this claim (that languagedeterminesthought) is likely false, there is strong empirical evidence to support the weaker version of this claim (that languageinfluencesthought). This seems to generalise to AI as well as humans, in that AI will often respond differently to the exact same prompt when translated into a different language.",text,55
https://www.openpaws.ai/research-and-reports/literature-review-on-developing-artificial-intelligence-to-advocate-for-animal-rights,"Of particular concern for us is the finding fromThe Language Barrier paperthat LLMs are much more likely to produce unsafe or irrelevant responses to malicious prompts in low resource languages (those which appear infrequently in pre-training data). This effect appears to be “hard-coded” into the LLM during pre-training and cannot be undone later through instruction-tuning. That means that if we don’t have sufficient data in a language during pre-training, it’s very unlikely we will be able to make much progress in removing speciesism in that language during fine-tuning, even if we fine-tune in that language.",text,56
https://www.openpaws.ai/research-and-reports/literature-review-on-developing-artificial-intelligence-to-advocate-for-animal-rights,"Luckily, we don’t need huge datasets in underrepresented languages to make a significant impact during pre-training.LLaMA Beyond Englishfound that models can achieve top transfer in knowledge and response quality in underrepresented languages with less than 1% of the pre-training data. So even if the vast majority of our data is in English, having at least a small amount in other languages will be enough to see huge leaps of performance in downstream tasks for those underrepresented languages - however, Open Paws will be taking additional steps to make sure our dataset is accessible to many other language communities and aware of their experiences and perspectives. It is important that we are not only be able to understand or generate texts in other languages, but remain sensitive to their cultural contexts.",text,57
https://www.openpaws.ai/research-and-reports/literature-review-on-developing-artificial-intelligence-to-advocate-for-animal-rights,"An additional consideration is that LLMs may struggle with language groups such as Chinese, compared to other languages that use Romanised scripts or alphabets. LLMs using token-based approaches have struggled with token planning and representing strings of Chinese characters as tokens. This was shown in theToken-Free LLMs paperwhere token-based language models tended to fail Chinese spelling tests, whilst token-free LLMs using characters or bytes instead of tokens had much better performance.",text,58
https://www.openpaws.ai/research-and-reports/literature-review-on-developing-artificial-intelligence-to-advocate-for-animal-rights,"One possible explanation for this is the diversity of Chinese characters compared to English. English contains 26 characters whilst Chinese contains over 50,000 in common usage, and the number of possible tokens expands exponentially as you increase the number of characters per token (i.e. if you have a 3-character long token, there are 17,576 possible tokens in English and 125,000,000,000,000 possible tokens in Chinese)",text,59
https://www.openpaws.ai/research-and-reports/literature-review-on-developing-artificial-intelligence-to-advocate-for-animal-rights,"There are also many cultural and linguistic differences between different language variants that use Chinese characters (for example, Taiwan and China have very different cultural and linguistic contexts whilst Mandarin and Cantonese both use the same characters despite otherwise having numerous differences).",text,60

One interesting finding is that performance on exam results does not change significantly through fine-tuning with RLHF. This suggests that intelligence gains do not happen during fine-tuning, they happen during pre-training, which in turn suggests that for our AI to gain knowledge of animal issues, it needs to gain this knowledge during pre-training. Another interesting finding is that GPT-4 was aware of its degree of certainty before RLHF, but not after. This suggests that by optimising entirely for “approval” the model learns to express overconfidence in its response rather than admit it doesn’t know something. GPT-4 used an additional fine-tuning technique with rule-based reward models to get it to stop refusing innocent requests (as GPT3.5 would often decline innocent requests as a side effect of the original RLHF). This seems to have been effective and appears easy to replicate using GPT-4 itself as a zero-shot classifier for training data. It’s also important to note that the safety card specifies that filtering the pre-training dataset was also pivotal in aligning the model, which backs up a lot of other research we’ve discussed suggesting RLHF will not be enough on its own to achieve AI without speciesism. They also note that the model exhibits undesirable behaviour when “instructions to labellers were underspecified” for prompts. This suggests (along with other research discussed) that we need to ensure human feedback volunteers receive adequate instruction.

This support is essential to foster innovation and ensure the sustainability and growth of pioneering efforts in a field that has received limited funding. Given the nascent stage of the AI-animal advocacy intersection, we suggest that funders concentrate on providing smaller seed funding grants to a broad array of organizations.
