"https://www.animalempathy.ph/","Bringing farmed animal issues in the Philippines to the forefront and harnessing collective action to effectively help farmed animals and our fellow Filipinos Towards a nation that fosters empathy for farmed animals Carmel Desiree Pascual, Alternative Protein Research Mapping Initiative in the Philippines “AEP played a crucial role in advancing my career and advocacy by supporting our alternative protein project. Through this incubation, I gained valuable insights, skills, and connections that are instrumental in my career progression. Given the limited opportunities in our country for exploring alternative proteins, my collaboration with AEP was pivotal in launching my career in this emerging field. I am now committed to accelerating the adoption and progress of alternative proteins in our country!” Althy Cendaña, Operations Associate at Fish Welfare Initiative “I finally made the transition and it's all thanks to [AEP’s]  support, advice, and challenging questions about what I want in my career. It's very important for me to be in a line of work where I have people who can relate with my experiences, but I realized that even though we don't work in the same organization, I will always have you so I won't feel so alone after all! AEP created a thriving community and support system for animal advocates in the Philippines. By attending AEP events and meetups, I learn so much from other advocates and I feel the boost in motivation to keep looking for ways to help end animal suffering. As an engineering graduate, it's been a big challenge for me to find opportunities within the space. I'm thankful to AEP for the push and for believing in my skills, that someday I'll be able to finally work for animal welfare. Through AEP's events and team, I was also able to grow my professional network- both local and international.","text",6
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/","My engagement with AEP has played a huge role in me getting my dream job at my dream organization.” Feil Immanuel Aquino “AEP capacitated me further as an animal advocate in the best form of learning possible--through experiences that both humble and empowered me. My time in AEP as a volunteer has been fruitful and heartwarming because I work with people I already know whom I had since been learning a lot from and still continue to learn from in each interaction that we have in-person and online. In a way, volunteering for AEP also gave me this quiet accountability mechanism to make a conscious effort in (a) re-evaluating my career fit and the aptitudes I currently have and want to grow into; (b) thinking about questions contextualized to the Philippines and LMICs that I want to live through to seek the answers; (c) and imagining a kinder, and more just world so I could position myself better in spaces where I can further contribute to solve neglected problems relevant to animal advocacy and alternative protein (extending to food security). Because of my participation in AEP, I think I have become a more engaged Effective Altruist to the global community and I can viscerally nurture the positive impact I hope to give to the world better albeit still being in undergrad.”","text",7

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/faqs","FAQs What is farmed animal advocacy and why is it important? Farmed animal advocacy is the promotion of the better quality of lives of animals that are being farmed particularly in agricultural settings. It is important because farmed animals are among the most numerous and poorly treated animals globally, facing widespread abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Farmed animal advocacy seeks to improve the lives of these animals and reduce their suffering. How does Animal Empathy Philippines approach farmed animal advocacy? At Animal Empathy Philippines, we are committed to creating a more compassionate world for farmed animals. Our strategies are rooted in empathy and evidence. Here’s how we make a difference: Empowering Caregivers.We support farmers and animal handlers in taking excellent care of their animals and themselves. Raising Awareness.We educate and inspire more Filipinos to foster empathy for animals and take action towards a just and sustainable future. Collaborative Efforts.We partner with other organizations and individuals to save more animal lives and amplify our impact. Central to the mission of Animal Empathy Philippines is our commitment to enhance public awareness and foster a deeper appreciation for the lives of farmed animals. We emphasize the sentient nature of farmed animals, recognizing them as beings capable of experiencing a range of feelings and experiences. Thus, making their lives worthy of significant consideration. What is the AEP Community? It’s a group of Filipinos with a shared goal: to discover and implement effective ways of helping farmed animals. This community serves as a dynamic and nurturing space for individuals who are passionate about farmed animal advocacy and are seeking ways to make a difference in the lives of these animals. How does Animal Empathy Philippines measure its impact in its advocacy for farmed animals?","text",5
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/faqs","Animal Empathy Philippines measures its impact in its advocacy for farmed animals by monitoring the number of individuals reached through its programs, projects, and activities, the likelihood of these individuals to stay in the cause area, and the number of farmed animal advocacy initiatives that are supported. The organization also regularly evaluates its approach and adjusts its strategies based on the data and results it collects.","text",6

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/new-page-1-1-1","AEP takes part in the biggest Vegan Festival in Asia Written by Jane B. Animal Empathy Philippines (AEP) embodied its unwavering commitment to compassion and climate action as they joined the VegFest Pilipinas 2023 last November 18-19, 2023 at The Spine, Blue Bay Walk, Pasay City. This year's VegFest Pilipinas 2023 is centered on the theme, ""healing the world with compassion and climate action,"" focusing on the importance of sustainability and a circular economy. VegFest 2023 also aims to raise awareness on climate action, which can be done by transitioning to veganism. In the festival, AEP called for the end of using animals, especially farmed animals, for human consumption, placing the core values of veganism at the forefront of VegFest Pilipinas 2023. In their booth, AEP resounded its call for empathy towards farmed animals through their placards with statements, “Farmed Animals Deserve Better!,” “Maki-baka para sa paglaya ng mga hayop,” “Hanggang ang bawat hayop ay malaya,” “Chick-ilin ang ispesisismo,” and “Pig-gilan ang pang-aabuso sa mga hayop!.” AEP firmly believes that taking a stance against the consumption of farmed animals is not only a moral imperative but also a huge leap towards achieving climate justice. By aligning with the principles of veganism, AEP strives to contribute to a more sustainable and compassionate world, addressing the pressing issues of climate change through more empathetic choices. AEP also partnered with Pansigedan Advocacy Cooperative (PAC), bringing a rich variety of fresh vegetables directly from Benguet to VegFest Pilipinas. This partnership not only provided a selection of recently harvested vegetables but also allowed AEP to engage with local farmers, igniting discussions on the importance of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) for sustainable agriculture. Animal Empathy Philippines' active involvement in VegFest Pilipinas 2023 speaks volumes about its commitment to promote compassion, climate action, and sustainable living.","text",6

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/new-page-1-1-1-2","The Directors of AEP attend the first-ever Philippine Animal Lover Heroes Award at University Hotel, Diliman  on November 30, 2023 The event not only celebrated the tireless efforts of individuals in the realm of animal welfare but also served as a pivotal platform for AEP to share its mission and vision with a broader audience. Ms. Lalaine Danao, a dedicated member of the AEP community and the founder of Tails, Trees, & Seas, extended the invitation to the event, requesting AEP's Executive Director, Kate, to present an introductory talk on farmed animal advocacy. This invitation marked a significant moment for AEP, unlocking doors to an event closely aligned with the organization's commitment to championing ethical treatment and consideration for all animals. For AEP, participating in the Philippine Animal Lover Heroes Awards was more than just attending a ceremony; it represented a strategic effort to connect companion animal advocacy with farmed animal advocacy. Although the event primarily emphasized companion animals, it offered AEP a valuable opportunity to introduce attendees to the crucial and interconnected issues surrounding farmed animals. The significance of this involvement lies in reaching an audience already sympathetic to animal welfare causes, particularly those centered on companion animals. AEP aimed to expand the perspectives of the attendees, prompting them to recognize the broader spectrum of animal rights issues. The participation in this event served as an opportunity to convey the narrative of interconnectedness, highlighting that compassion for animals goes beyond our domestic companions to include those often overlooked on industrial farms. This event served as a profound learning experience for AEP, offering a unique opportunity to glean insights from the stories and experiences shared by fellow animal advocates.","text",7
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/new-page-1-1-1-2","These narratives not only inspire the organization, but also catalyze the generation of innovative ideas to propel our farmed animal advocacy initiatives forward. Moreover, AEP’s participation in this event has forged new collaborations, garnered increased support, and expanded the reach of its message. This collective effort is instrumental in advancing AEP’s mission, fostering empathy, and nurturing compassion for all sentient beings, with a special focus on farmed animals.","text",8

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/news-aep-walk-for-compassion","Animal Empathy Philippines supported the Walk Together for Compassion 2024 last April 20, 2024 in Altaraza Central Park, City of San Jose Del Monte Bulacan. With the theme of ""Filipino Families Matter, All Pets Matter Too!"", this event aimed to raise funds for the second printing of the heartwarming children's book, ""Derby, The Abandoned Dog"", written by Ms. Lalaine Duano Manaog, a member of the AEP community. The book, once printed, will be distributed for free in Public Elementary Schools across Bulacan, touching the hearts and minds of young readers and instilling empathy towards animals. Also present in the event were one cat and dogs of different breeds.  The event started with a pet blessing ceremony. Ging Geronimo, AEP’s Director for Public Affairs, delivered a short talk about animal empathy and emphasized that empathy and compassion starts at home. She shared that farmed animals like companion animals also long to be heard, seen, and cared for. She also stressed the importance of providing a loving home for companion animals and considering them as treasured family members.","text",7

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/news-aep-walk-for-compassion","Ging Geronimo (left) with the participants at the Walk Together for Compassion 2024 “I am witnessing the growth of  something organic. Perhaps this is the people’s response to the recent injustice that some companion animals like Killua have suffered. There are still several dogs who spend their entire lives on chains and they’re no different from the millions of farmed animals in cages. All of these animals are longing to be free and be part of a pack  or a community just like us“, Geronimo said. The Walk Together for Compassion 2024 was more than just a gathering of animal lovers and their companion animals at the Altaraza Central Park; it was a testament to the power of empathy and community spirit. Attendees came together as one community to show their support to the cause in public and to encourage other Filipinos to have compassion for animals. With funds raised and awareness spread, the journey towards creating a more compassionate society continues, one step at a time.

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/new-page-1-1","Understanding Farmed Animals and Advocates in Action: Lupango shed light on the term ""farmed"" animals, emphasizing their exploitation for agricultural purposes. She narrated that farmed animals are usually mentioned in the news, citing examples like rabbits used as pork alternatives and cockfighting as a form of entertainment in the Philippines. She also mentioned that there are not a lot of laws protecting farmed animals, as compared to companion animals. Despite the lack of legislation for farmed animal rights, Lupango expressed hope, drawing on data that showcased Filipinos' care for both companion and farmed animals. Some advocacy efforts including a 300-strong Animal Rights March and the innovative work of vegan chefs reimagining Filipino dishes showcased the growing momentum for change. What AEP has learned so far: AEP emerged as a crucial force in farmed animal advocacy. Operating not only in Manila but also in provinces, AEP supports Filipino advocates in reducing the suffering of farmed animals. The organization prioritizes effective communication, supports advocates' initiatives, and actively engages in lobbying efforts. Lupango shared the organization’s key learnings, emphasizing on the importance of presenting a clear picture of animal suffering, providing avenues for advocacy, recognizing Filipinos' concern for animal causes, and building a supportive community. She also mentioned AEP's commitment to investing in people's potential, which underscores AEP’s mission to drive meaningful and sustainable change. Moving forward Lupango ended the talk by urging the audience to rally behind AEP's impactful initiatives. She encouraged active participation through community membership, social media engagement, and collaboration with AEP's partner organization, the Pansigedan Advocacy Cooperative (PAC). PAC brought along Benguet farmers, along with a bounty of fresh vegetables from the region.","text",6

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/new-page-1-1","AEP’s Executive Director shares the connection of farmed animal advocacy and climate action at VegFest Pilipinas 2023 Written by Jane B. The recent Vegan Festival Pilipinas 2023 (VegFest 2023) served as a platform for meaningful discussions on the intersection of animal welfare, and climate action. Among the presenters was Animal Empathy Philippines' (AEP) executive director, Kate Lupango, who shared her insights from her talk entitled, ""From Seeds to Solutions: Vegans as Catalysts for Animals and Climate Action."" Vegan Journey and Challenges: Lupango began her presentation with her journey on becoming vegan, which sparked during a coastal cleanup activity where she realized that animals do suffer. This experience propelled her to research on animal rights, and abide by the values of not inflicting suffering on humans and animals. Her transitioning to veganism was made easier by the accessibility of an array of vegan products in Metro Manila, and a social circle that embraced her transition. Despite these advantages, she acknowledged external challenges, such as a lack of support beyond her immediate network and the need for more avenues to advocate for animal rights.

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/womens-month-feature-carissa","Hello!I’m Carissa.I’m an engineer/content creator. A few years ago,  I studied Environmental Sustainability and learned about the environmental impacts of animal agriculture. This sparked my journey to gradually shift towards a vegan life. Why do you think it’s important to advocate for farmed animals? It’s important because it addresses numerous societal issues: 1) Animal agriculture is a leading contributor to climate change. Breeding billions of a specific species of animals disrupts the ecological balance of nature. 2) Farm animals are just as sentient as the animals we welcome into our homes. They too are worthy of our kindness and compassion. 3) The World Health Organization reports that consuming animal meat is a major risk factor for cancer. What farmed animal advocacy or plant-based initiatives are you currently doing or planning to do? I create vegan content across my social media platforms. I share my vegan life -recipes, cruelty-free fashion & beauty, food discoveries, etc. I also collaborate with  various organizations in spreading awareness and support in this advocacy. If you could share with us, like one story in your farmed animal advocacy journey that has touched you so well and you still remember, please share here. Feel free to add links, photos, a video, etc. I have a shy personality and I had zero social media skills so being a content creator never crossed my mind. Yet, it was an encounter with a bird that inspired me to begin sharing my advocacy.","text",7

Viewers became so invested in her that they named her Marites. They also compelled me (an introvert) to create a Tiktok series chronicling her family life. A Tiktok series which they called #Pugadserye.  People tuned in to her life.

After Marites’ family moved out of the nest, she left me a Tiktok account with a hundred thousand followers. It’s remarkable how this little bird who couldn’t even speak gave me so much voice. In recognition of the voice she gave me, I committed to using the platform to speak up for animals like her, turning the audience she built into advocates for her cause. Thanks to Marites, I was able to spread awareness across various channels - schools, events, and even on national TV. I’m amazed at how much momentum she gave me. Her story fueled my courage and determination to continue advocating for the voiceless. What is your message to other farmed animal advocates, especially the women and young girls?

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/womens-month-feature-althy","I’m Althy, I work as Operations Associate for Fish Welfare Initiative. My advocacy journey started in 2020, when a hen supposedly meant for food became our family’s pet— Henny became my pandemic best friend. I would hang out with her and read about chickens on the internet, and I learned a lot about their personalities and what makes them happy, sad, or nervous. Why do you think it’s important to advocate for farmed animals? People find it hard to empathize with farmed animals because they are often viewed as commodities and not as living beings with thoughts and feelings. Advocating for farmed animals is the first step in creating a more compassionate world where their well-being is acknowledged and cared for. What farmed animal advocacy or plant-based initiatives are you currently doing or planning to do? I currently work for Fish Welfare Initiative, a charity that collaborates with fish farmers, corporations, and the government in India to improve the welfare of farmed fish, specifically the Indian major carp species, as much as possible. What is your message to other farmed animal advocates, especially the women and young girls? Always remember that a little bit of anything goes a long way! Today you could be volunteering in an organization, attending an educational talk about farmed animal advocacy, or taking small steps towards a plant-based diet, and it might feel like it’s too small for all the animals you’d like to help. Still, while you didn’t change the world overnight, you changed a little part of it for the better!

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/five-freedoms-of-animal-welfare","Photo byPascal DebrunneronUnsplash The Five Freedoms outline five aspects of animal welfare under human control, including companion animals like dogs and cats in the home, exotic animal species in aquariums and zoos, and animals who are raised in the food system. These Five Freedoms are globally recognized as the gold standard in animal welfare, encompassing both the mental and physical well-being of animals[1]. They include: Freedom from hunger and thirst: by ready access to fresh water and a diet to maintain full health and vigor. For example, piglets and adult pigs need different types of food provided on different schedules. Freedom from discomfort: by providing an appropriate environment including shelter and a comfortable resting area. This includes providing soft bedding in an area with the appropriate temperature, noise levels, and access to natural light. Freedom from pain, injury or disease: by prevention or rapid diagnosis and treatment. This includes vaccination, monitoring, and treatment of any injuries. Freedom to express normal behavior: by providing sufficient space, proper facilities, and company of the animal’s own kind. For example, making sure the animals are able to stretch, run, jump, and play. Freedom from fear and distress: by ensuring conditions and treatment which avoid mental suffering. These can be achieved by preventing overcrowding and providing sufficient enrichment and safe hiding spaces. What is its history? The Five Freedoms were rooted back in the 1964 book “Animal Machines” written by Ruth Harrison where it described intensive livestock and poultry farming practices of the time. The outcry of the British public regarding the information in the book prompted the British government to appoint a committee to look into the welfare of farmed animals.","text",7
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/five-freedoms-of-animal-welfare","In 1965, the committee presented the 85-page “Report of the Technical Committee to Inquire into the Welfare of Animals Kept under Intensive Livestock Husbandry Systems,” where it stated that animals should have the freedom “to stand up, lie down, turn around, groom themselves and stretch their limbs.” The Farm Animal Welfare Council was created as a response to monitoring the livestock production sector. By the end of 1979, the initial Five Freedoms had been codified.","text",8
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/five-freedoms-of-animal-welfare","The Five Freedoms have been adopted and used as the basis in writing animal care protocols and expectations for many professional groups including veterinarians, and organizations including the World Organization for Animal Health, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. What is the importance of these freedoms for animals? Over centuries, different animal species adapt to their environment to survive in their respective natural habitats. According to Innate Behavior of Animals (2021), some species even genetically are “pre-programmed” to find food and shelter, mate with each other, and care for their offspring. But when humans take away animals into their own captivity, they can quickly lose their survival instincts and abilities. The Five Freedoms come in as humans take on their responsibility to provide the animal with what they need to survive. Although there’s no way for animals to live their life to the fullest in captivity, the Five Freedoms establish guidelines for humans to create a living situation for animals that still allows them to express their instincts and behaviors—food to eat, water to drink, shelter to sleep in, space to move around in, and friends and family to interact with[5]. In short, the Five Freedoms are important to preserving animals’ health in captivity, both physically and mentally. What are the problems with the Five Freedoms? The Five Freedoms are supposedly made to assert every animal’s right to humane treatment from the humans who look after them, regardless of their species. Yet, cases of animal suffering are still happening today. According to Amanda Waxman from the Humane League (2021), the problem of the Five Freedoms is the vagueness in the freedoms themselves. What constitutes a balanced diet? What is the size of a decent living environment? Because of the lack of specifications, it can lead to open interpretations upon implementation.","text",9
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/five-freedoms-of-animal-welfare","This is certainly the case in animal agriculture in which factory farms continue to trap cows, pigs, chickens, turkeys, and goats in filthy, overcrowded facilities with no sunlight or access to the outdoors. This in turn promotes humane washing where marketing and deceptive labeling on the treatment of animals or the condition in which they are born, raised, or killed.","text",10
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/five-freedoms-of-animal-welfare","This is where the Five Freedoms fall short. Its standards are open to interpretation—allowing factory farms to ignore measures to protect animal welfare—and they do not actually reflect everything that animals need to preserve their physical and mental well-being. And this needs to be changed sooner. What is beyond the Five Freedoms? The Five Freedoms do not fully capture the meaning of what it is like for an animal to have a life worth living. This goes beyond basic necessities provided to these animals; it means providing them with the best possible positive experiences for them. For animals to have “lives worth living” it is necessary to minimize their negative experiences and at the same time to provide the animals with opportunities to have positive experiences[4]. With a marked increase in scientific understanding over the last two decades, the need to review and update minimum standards in codes of welfare is to be done. And indeed, it’s been inspiring to see welfare experts and advocates proposing for such. Regardless of how these animal welfare standards take shape, giving animals a “life worth living” requires a degree of genuine consideration and care from humans—care which is completely absent from our broken factory farm system, which places profit over the well-being of animals raised for food[5]. And it is our hope for humanity to recognize and act on this care. Resources [1] American Humane. (2016, October 17).Five Freedoms: the gold standard of animal welfare.

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/empathy-in-action-a-workshop-on-farmed-animal-advocacy","Empathy in Action: A Workshop on Farmed Animal Advocacy Written byJulia Dolfo De Castro(AEP’s Learning and Development Associate) AEP strategies post-pandemic This year, as the COVID-19 pandemic dies down, Animal Empathy Philippines (AEP) decided to shift from virtual engagements to in-person events for the first time since its founding in September 2021. This shift aligns with AEP's core mission of nurturing a community deeply committed to helping farmed animals. The online and offline meet-ups certainly had their own advantages and disadvantages, and these certainly informed AEP’s planning of subsequent capacity- and community-building events. With online events, participants from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao were able to attend and enrich the discussions. Meanwhile, with offline events, interactions and friendships were noticeably formed. Recognizing the value of these personal connections, AEP was inspired to conduct its capacity-building project face-to-face, aiming to further cement the bonds within the animal advocacy community and enhance our collective impact on farmed animal advocacy. Brainstorming Empathy in Action Since its inception, AEP has hosted one fellowship that aimed to help improve animal advocacy in the country: the Animal Advocacy Introductory Fellowship (AAIF) in 2022. AAIF’s curriculum was adapted from Animal Advocacy Careers’ Introduction to Animal Advocacy online course. In the said fellowship, fellows have learned about the different problems of animals of any kind (be it farmed animals, wild animals, marine animals, animals used in labs, etc.). Fellows showed a strong motivation to take action for animals and give helpful insights on why the problems of animals are neglected even when they are large in scale. As a culminating effort, they presented their capstone projects**, showcasing some practical solutions and initiatives.","text",5
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/empathy-in-action-a-workshop-on-farmed-animal-advocacy","To empower advocates in their efforts to amplify the voices of animals, AEP opted to give a series of three in-person workshops focused on farmed animal advocacy that culminates in a capstone project. Empathy in Action is thus a workshop series on how advocates can effectively put their empathy for farmed animals into action where the capstone project is their proposed action for famed animals.","text",6
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/empathy-in-action-a-workshop-on-farmed-animal-advocacy","Empathy in Action aimed: To help farmed animal advocates identify their values and roles and therefore empower them in their advocacy efforts To help farmed animal advocates use their skills and talents in amplifying the unheard (or misheard) voices of farmed animals To foster a supportive and collaborative environment among farmed animal advocates in the Philippines and thereby increase the number of farmed animal advocates The workshop series was open to individuals who want to learn about farmed animal advocacy and who are interested in advocating for farmed animals. ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 1 The first-ever fellowship focused on farmed animal advocacy in the Philippines was pioneered byEffective Altruism Philippines(EA PH) in 2021. EA PH co-founder Kate Lupango organized the Effective Animal Advocacy Fellowship with Ging Geronimo and Giana Nuncio. The program offered an insightful exploration into crucial aspects of effective animal advocacy, shedding light on the broader animal advocacy community and highlighting career paths that could significantly benefit animal welfare. Recognizing the promising impact of having a dedicated community of farmed animal advocates in the Philippines, Kate and Ging were inspired to officially establish AEP as an organization on September 4, 2021. 2  AEP pushed through with some of the capstone projects that were presented by the AAIF fellows. Alaina Amilanto’s article on sabong (cockfighting) was published in Manila Bulletin’s Animal Scene magazine. Anna Valino’s artworks were used in some of AEP’s publicity materials. Jimboy Asoy’s research on Good Animal Husbandry Practices in Capiz State University is currently being conducted in partnership with AEP and is set to be completed next year.","text",7
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/empathy-in-action-a-workshop-on-farmed-animal-advocacy","━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ The Workshop Series Before the three in-depth workshops, Empathy in Action began with a kick-off workshop that offered a sneak peek into farmed animal advocacy, where participants learned the arbitrary differences between companion animals and farmed animals. Participants learned that companion animals are those that we share a life with and that farmed animals are those we normally, in our society, utilize for food, clothing, and farming methods.","text",8
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/empathy-in-action-a-workshop-on-farmed-animal-advocacy","In the sneak peek session, participants realized that not only are the animals we usually consider as companions farmed in other cultures and countries, but also that farmed animals (like Esther the Wonder Pig) can be great companions too. From their group sharings, they learned that farmed animals feel pain and joy too just like their beloved companion animals. From discovering that they can have empathy for farmed animals, they learned that they can turn that empathy into action and advocate for farmed animals. They learned that as humans, they have a voice and that we can use this voice to amplify the often misheard or unheard voices of farmed animals. They then reflected on their values as advocates and identified their skills that they can use to achieve the desired end for farmed animals. Following the sneak peek session (Week 0) were the three in-depth workshop sessions (Weeks 1–3). Week 1 of Empathy in Action aimed to understand the why of farmed animal advocacy. Thus, in the first in-depth workshop, participants learned that farmed animals (from vertebrates to invertebrates) are sentient beings. For many advocates, that animals are sentient is enough “why” for us to advocate for farmed animals. However, as the participants learned from a role-playing activity regarding multi-stakeholders in the agri-food chain (farmers and fisherfolk, businesses, and consumers), the realities suffered by farmed animals are much more complex. The realities of farmed animals are complicated by a systemic way of perceiving them: speciesism. The participants understood that farmed animals, as sentient beings, can be stakeholders too. They have an interest in living freely and with autonomy and the challenge for us as advocates is to learn how to respond to the voice of farmed animals staking a claim for their interests.","text",9
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/empathy-in-action-a-workshop-on-farmed-animal-advocacy","Participants shared that the role-playing activity made them see the problem of animal farming as a systemic problem that demands engaging with farmer and fisherfolk communities who live closest to farmed animals, communicating or negotiating with policymakers, and collaborating solutions with various sectors, rather than simply committing to a lifestyle change.","text",10

Week 2 of Empathy in Action, or the second in-depth session in the workshop series, explored the various ways of helping farmed animals. Participants learned to look at the problem of animal farming using EA’s ITN Framework. Participants learned that in terms of scale or importance, animal farming is a really big and complex problem that has catastrophic consequences, such as the following: Animal agriculture is one of the leading drivers of climate change. Habitats of wild animals are being destroyed for animal agriculture, driving wild animals to extinction. Animal agriculture has been found to be a leading enabler of zoonotic infectious diseases and antibiotic resistance, eventually causing pandemics. However, despite the scale of the problem, animal farming is a highly neglected problem. The scale of farmed animal advocacy is so small compared to advocacy for companion animals. Nonetheless, when it comes to advocating for farmed animals, there are many people already hard at work and whose efforts are worth investing in.This shows that farmed animal advocacy, despite its scale, is still solvable or tractable.Participants learned that there are already so many organizations around the world that are trying to help farmed animals. In Asia and the Philippines, in particular, there is already a growing network or community of advocates for farmed animals and they have been doing inspiring work. Given the scale, neglectedness, and solvability of animal farming, participants learned that the problem of animal farming can be tackled by mapping out a Theory of Change roadmap. They articulated the change they want to see for farmed animals (particularly chicken and fish), imagined the outcomes that they desire to achieve that dream or goal, and identified the tactics or actions advocates can do to create some outcomes.","text",16
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/empathy-in-action-a-workshop-on-farmed-animal-advocacy","As chickens and fish are the most farmed and slaughtered animals in the Philippines, the participants were grouped into two: team chicken and team fish.

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/empathy-in-action-a-workshop-on-farmed-animal-advocacy","Theory of Change roadmap for fish The Capstone Projects In Week 3 of Empathy in Action, a total of six farmed animal advocates presented (while two submitted) their action or plan for farmed animals and received feedback from their fellow advocates. This was an opportunity for the participants to learn from others so that they could know with whom they can possibly collaborate. This session was intended to practice building relationships and strengthening communities with farmed animal advocates. It was designed so that participants could appreciate the community of informed and passionate farmed animal advocates that emerged from the workshop series. The capstone projects that were presented were diverse and remarkable. There were participants who presented a research project that they intend to do in the future (one of them in fact plans to develop his project into a thesis). One research topic proposed was about introducing chickens as companion animals to Gen Z youth and another was on exploring the possibilities of sea plants as alternative sources of food from the oceans. There were participants who proposed media campaigns that aim to change how people see chickens and fish. One participant conveyed that aquatic life is not often visible in the farmed animal advocacy space despitefish being one of the most farmed animals globally. Research and awareness campaigns were the most common capstone projects. The other capstone projects had various focus areas. One participant began the groundwork of building a career repository of animal advocacy opportunities in the Philippines. Another explored marketing strategies in introducing broccoli and cauliflowers as alternatives to chicken meat. Another participant proposed a communication strategy in farmed animal advocacy, highlighting urgency. Finally, one participant successfully conducted a talk, called Apathy 2 Empathy, on farmed animal advocacy in partnership with AEP.","text",21
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/empathy-in-action-a-workshop-on-farmed-animal-advocacy","The presentation of capstone projects and giving of feedback had been a truly meaningful event.

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/empathy-in-action-a-workshop-on-farmed-animal-advocacy","Challenges, Strategies, and Learnings One of the core aims of AEP is to increase the number of farmed animal advocates in the country. Thus, for Empathy in Action, the number of participants was a key concern. The sneak peek workshop served as an opportunity to strategize in terms of targeting participants. Empathy in Action had 22 sign-ups, but only six participants showed up during the sneak peek workshop, with half of the attendees already active members of an EA PH student group. Thus, we invited animal advocacy student organizations, like Community Animals Partners and Welfare Advocates UP (CAPWA UP), Friends of Campus Animals UP (FOCA UP), Ateneans Guided and Inspired by Love for Animals (AGILA), Silong, and Stray Watchers Philippines, among others, to increase the number of attendees for Empathy in Action. This proved to be effective as not only did the number of attendees nearly double in the next session, but the attendees—which included representatives from AGILA and Stray Watchers Philippines—were highly interested in exploring more ways to effectively advocate for farmed animals. In total, there were 15 participants who attended at least one workshop session. A key learning for AEP was to diversify and tailor its approach for different age groups, with a priority on engaging with the youth and youth organizations, as this results in more impactful outcomes. The youth are not only receptive to new concepts and more likely to embrace progressive ideas about animal advocacy, but they also represent future policymakers, influencers, and leaders.","text",23

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/farmed-animal-advocacy-movement-in-the-philippines-what-are-we-doing-and-where-are-we-heading","Farmed animal advocacy movement in the Philippines: What are we doing and where are we heading? by Julia Dolfo de Castro The Various Roles of Filipino Farmed Animal Advocates Recently, the Philippines was reported to beone of the countries that are least cruel to farmed animals. This can be surprising asmeat is deeply part of many Filipino food. Nonetheless, in the Philippines, an increasing number of individuals and organizations are actively engaged in advocating for the welfare of farmed animals. These advocates play various roles in different areas, contributing to the overall mission of improving the lives of farmed animals and our perception of them. Below are some of the key roles played by Filipino farmed animal advocates. 1.Direct Care There are dedicated individuals and organizations that provide sanctuary and care not only for companion animals but also for farmed animals. Organizations like the Philippine Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), Animal Kingdom Foundation (AKF), Happy Animals Club, Philippine Animal Rescue Team (PART), andBest Friends Furever Sanctuary, Inc.work tirelessly to provide a safe haven for rescued farmed animals. Some of these organizations are also involved indisaster relief operations, rescuing both companion and farmed animals in times of natural calamities. 2.Lobbying and Campaigns Many organizations that are into direct care also work tirelessly to lobby causes for farmed animals. For one, PAWS haslobbied for improving the welfare of animals in farms and slaughterhouses. In 2020, PAWS launched The Better Chicken Option (TBCO) campaign to urge farmers, through webinars and roundtable discussions, to commit to higher welfare standards in raising broiler chickens. In 2021, they commissioned a study that revealed that Filipinos care about chickens next to dogs and cats. Because of this information, PAWS was able to make restaurants and food businesses like Figaro, Tien Ma’s, Angel’s Pizza, and Binalot sign up to be TBCO partners.","text",5

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/farmed-animal-advocacy-movement-in-the-philippines-what-are-we-doing-and-where-are-we-heading","There are researchers in the Philippines who are actively working on alternative proteins and farmed animal advocacy. Notably, Animal Empathy Philippines (AEP) has initiated ascoping report on alternative proteins. AEP recently concluded its journey mapping research on Filipino farmed animal advocates. Meanwhile,AKF has conducted a study to better understand the state of fish welfare in the Philippines, specifically farmers’ and stakeholders' perception toward fish welfare and their awareness of relevant welfare regulations, standards, and laws. From their findings, they were able to provide recommendations on how to capacitate stakeholders in improving fish welfare in the Philippines. These efforts are crucial in providing data that will inform farmed animal advocacy in the country. 4.Education Several community groups formed in social media conduct workshops, fellowships, and discussions to raise awareness about farmed animal advocacy. Manila Vegans, a Facebook community group, not only provides space and resources for individuals who want to keep farmed animals off their plates; they also organize educational webinars and discussions to help individuals become better farmed animal advocates. AEP has also been conducting fellowships andworkshopsto capacitate and empower farmed animal advocates in their advocacy efforts. 5.Community Engagement Creating a sense of community is crucial in any advocacy movement. There are several groups that organize get-togethers and social activities to foster a safe and friendly environment for advocates and allies. Some Facebook community groups like Manila Vegans and Vegan Brunch Club PH hold potlucks where animal advocates can socialize.","text",7

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/farmed-animal-advocacy-movement-in-the-philippines-what-are-we-doing-and-where-are-we-heading","6.Alternative Solutions Some advocates provide practical solutions by creating alternatives to animal products. They work on developing plant-based alternatives to meat and vegan versions of traditional Filipino foods. By offering viable and delicious alternatives, advocates like chef RG Enriquez-Diez (widely known asAstig Vegan) contribute to reducing the demand for animal products and promoting a more compassionate lifestyle. WTH Foodsis just one of the many companies venturing into food innovation, creating plant-based alternative meats from soy, wheat, and microalgae. 7.Communications Communication plays a vital role in raising awareness about farmed animal welfare. Many Filipino farmed animal advocates utilize social media platforms and create artistic expressions to spread their message of compassion. Through engaging content and personal stories, they showcase how their lifestyles align with their values, encouraging others to consider the ethical implications of their dietary choices. 8.Healthcare and Fitness Practice There are farmed animal advocates who emphasize the benefits of veganism or a plant-based lifestyle to health and fitness. Plant-based nutritionist-dietitian Roni Matalog is on a mission to help Filipino vegans, vegetarians, or anyone who's interested in shifting to a plant-based lifestyle achieve their optimal health through a plant-based diet that is adequate, balanced, and sustainable. Her goal is to provide her clients the tools, resources, support, accountability, and guidance to eat more whole plant foods and live a joyful and fulfilling plant-based life. The documentaryThe Game Changershas inspired many health-conscious individuals and athletes to go plant-based. It debunks the myth that we need to kill animals to acquire protein. As Filipina fitness coaches Sam Bumagat and Air Hernaez prove, it is possible to be strong and fit on a vegan diet.","text",9
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/farmed-animal-advocacy-movement-in-the-philippines-what-are-we-doing-and-where-are-we-heading","9.Movement Building There are non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and start-ups dedicated to farmed animal advocacy that seek funding or grants to support their initiatives and help grow the farmed animal movement. These organizations play a critical role in bringing together advocates and capacitating them, coordinating efforts and interventions, and implementing impactful projects that drive change at a larger scale.","text",10
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/farmed-animal-advocacy-movement-in-the-philippines-what-are-we-doing-and-where-are-we-heading","Who Else Are Working in the Space? In a deep dive session held by the AEP core team in January, it was discussed that there are more active efforts and interventions being done by farmed animal advocates in the Philippines although they may not be explicit. As Enzo Bautista says, animal advocacy is a spectrum. Thus, we have to recognize that farmed animal advocates are on different levels in terms of awareness and efforts. Thus, Indigenous Peoples can be considered advocates too. They, after all, have a different view of animals and Nature, one that is not extractivist and which we must be receptive to if we are to commit to changing our relation with farmed animals. People in tech, as pointed out by Castle Reynera, also help farmed animal advocacy by analyzing data and developing technological tools that can help improve the lives of farmed animals. Some healers and meditation practitioners, as mentioned by Janaisa Baril, help us see the world holistically and advocate for respecting nonhuman animals with whom we share the world. Definitely, Filipino farmed animal advocates contribute to the betterment of our perception and treatment of farmed animals in various roles and areas. Collectively, these endeavors certainly work towards creating a more compassionate and sustainable future for farmed animals in the Philippines. Where Are We Going? During the core team’s first deep dive session discussing where farmed animal advocacy in the Philippines is heading given the above-mentioned efforts and our available resources, it was pointed out that some promising opportunities in the movement would be maximizing support in existing communities through partnerships, empowering the youth through capacity building, connecting with other advocacies, leveraging on multimedia and new media for more visibility, and prioritizing available opportunities.","text",11

Nonetheless,mapping the journey of Filipinos to farmed animal advocacyis already a step forward in supporting and expanding the growing movement in the Philippines.","text",12

Human beings have a tendency to draw boundaries, but over the centuries, our boundaries have expanded and included many people that were previously outside of it (1). This boundary is called the moral circle. It’s a concept introduced by Lecky (1869) and popularized by Singer (1981), which refers to the boundary around entities that are granted moral concern (1),(2).","text",7
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/am-i-in-your-circle","https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/63ce292349adf6520a6cfb6f/2ab80c2e-1910-4e68-8087-16e354ab5a88/AEP_Moral+Circle+1.png","image",8
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/am-i-in-your-circle","The Moral Circle. This conceptualization draws on Crimston et al. (2018).(4) Those in the inner circle are granted full moral consideration: their interests are fully taken into account in moral decision-making. Those in the outer circle are granted a moderate level of moral consideration, but their interests are devalued relative to those in the inner circle. Those at the frontiers of the circle, on the other hand, are granted minimal moral consideration, and those outside of the circle are granted no moral consideration at all (4). Another illustration of the moral circle comes from Environmental Ethics, which overviews an ethical sequence in which the individual extends concern outward beyond the self to progressively more inclusive levels (2).","text",9
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/am-i-in-your-circle","https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/63ce292349adf6520a6cfb6f/fb093160-6987-42e6-813d-fdfa1ff109e9/AEP+Moral+circle.png","image",10
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/am-i-in-your-circle","Moral Circle,Environmental Ethics(6) Let’s take Alice and Bob as an example. Perhaps Alice’s moral circle includes only herself and her family, while Bob’s moral circle includes all animals (including all people). With reference to the diagram above, we could say that Alice’s moral circle includes only the first two green circles. On the other hand, Bob’s moral circle extends to all entities in the light yellow circle (i.e., all animals, including all people)(2). This may suggest that Alice believes, or will act as if, only herself and her kin have moral standing; who have “intrinsic moral worth”. Meanwhile, Bob may believe, or act as if, all animals have moral standing. So, Alice and Bob may not think in similar terms, and there may be inconsistencies between their actions and their beliefs (2). Why do we think it’s important to expand our moral circle? “The only justifiable stopping place for the expansion of altruism is the point at which all whose welfare can be affected by our actions are included within the circle of altruism.” -Peter Singer, inThe Expanding Circle: Ethics, Evolution, and Moral Progress Moral circle expansion is when you move your inner circle outwards. An example of this is stretching your sense of care from kin to people of other races to nonhuman animals, such that “more distant” entities are now in one’s moral circle (2). Failure to expand our moral circle has led to the extreme suffering of many sentient beings. If only communities had extended their moral concern to other groups of sentient beings, many historical atrocities could have been prevented. This includes extending moral concern to humans of various races, sexualities, genders, or nationalities—or animals of various species who share this planet with humankind. So even if one is unsure what exactly the future of the moral circle should look like, pushing on the current frontiers of the moral circle is a compelling moral priority.","text",11
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/am-i-in-your-circle","If you are concerned with doing the most good or with preventing serious wrongs, then expanding the moral circle to include, ideally all sentient beings, is worthy of consideration (3).","text",12
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/am-i-in-your-circle","Why include farmed animals in our moral circle? Over 100 billion land animals are on farms right now, according to the Sentience Institute. And sadly, the overwhelming majority — 99% in the US and over 90% globally — are crowded in inhumane facilities known as “factory farms.” The intensive confinement of animals on these farms leads to a range of psychological and physical health problems (9). Many of these animals endure painful deaths because of health complications caused by their breeding or environment (8). Some animals are debeaked, castrated, or mutilated in other ways without anesthesia. These are just some examples of the suffering farmed animals experience. While there are some laws globally and locally in place to protect their interests, society has a long way to go before farmed animals are granted full moral circle inclusion. Additionally, attention to farm animal welfare is highly neglected. This means that even when we only consider the limited resources that society directs to nonhuman animal issues, a small proportion (7) goes towards farmed animals. Having farmed animals as frontiers of the moral circle is important to consider as increased concern for farmed animals may be the gateway to consideration for future sentient beings who may exist in astronomical numbers and who may be very dissimilar to humans (3).

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/womens-month-feature-leona","I’m Leona, the Gulay Fairy of Good Food Community, Good Food Sundays and supplier of organically-grown produce sourced from small-holder farmers. Transitioning to a vegan lifestyle and eventually becoming a farmed animal advocate definitely wasn’t an overnight thing for me. It started in 2021, when mytitaasked me to watch the documentaryCowspiracyand told me she wanted to try switching to a plant-based diet. The documentary highlighted the adverse effects that animal agriculture has on the environment and how it was the leading cause of deforestation, water consumption and pollution in the world. One particular line struck me the most:“You can't be an environmentalist and eat animal products. Period!”So, I took it a challenge then and started eating plant-based for environmental reasons. But it was only when I watched the documentaryEarthlingsthe following year that I was initiated to the horrors that exist not only in the meat industry, but in the other industries that minimizes the existence of non-human animals for human use. It was then that I started to really consider myself as a vegan and wanted to do as much as I can to advocate not only for farmed animals, but all animals. Why do you think it’s important to advocate for farmed animals? Growing up, the use of animals was so ingrained in my everyday life that I never really had the chance to question it. Nobody in my circle questioned it, my family never questioned it, people who I considered as role models never openly questioned it. It was only then when I kept seeing videos of plant-based recipes when I scroll on social media, when I saw documentaries, when I saw there was a large and active Filipino vegan community, when basically, I saw other activists challenging my world view, that I realized that there was something wrong. And if it were not for them, I wouldn’t be where I am today.","text",7
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/womens-month-feature-leona","So I think it’s important for us to advocate for farmed animals in whatever ways we can because there might be anotherme, another past version of you, out there just waiting for a push.","text",8
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/womens-month-feature-leona","What farmed animal advocacy or plant-based initiatives are you currently doing or planning to do? Part of my work inGood Foodis helping our community have a healthier relationship with our local and seasonal produce. From sharing easy to replicate plant-based recipes through our social media platforms to cooking vegetable-forward dishes every time we visit our urban poor and farming communities. I want people to feel joy when we cook and eat together. And maybe, when they arrive at the crossroads of whether or not they want to make a change in their life, they can look back at the good times that we’ve had and realize that they can move forward knowing they have a community ready to help them in their journey. Apart from this, I do my best to attend workshops and events by animal advocacy groups like AEP, AAA, and Metro Manila Save. While It’s still in the works, I am also helping to launch a vegan-led event this year that will focus on the abundance of Philippine Flora, and their role in maintaining a sustainable food system. Please watch out for it! If you could share with us, like one story in your farmed animal advocacy journey that has touched you so well and you still remember, please share here. Feel free to add links, photos, a video, etc. I found my purpose and my community through this advocacy. The privilege I have to be surrounded by wonderful people, the laughs that I can share with them, the picnics I can have with them, the food I can cook with them, as well as the struggles that I can go through with them. All of these moments are precious to me and help me continue to persist.","text",9

There will be many challenges in the life of a farmed animal advocate. While majority of the advocacy community are wonderful people, there will be outliers. Don’t let them dishearten you. You don’t have to be perfect. Nobody is perfect. Always remember that you’re doing what you do for the animals, not the people that might judge you. It’s also crucial for us to be wholistic and intersectional. Remember, humans are animals, too. With that, your well-being and the well-being of your community is also of utmost importance. Choosing your battles, stepping back, and taking breaks are necessary so you don’t burn out. Animal advocacy can be alienating and divisive, but know that you’re not alone. We’re here for you!

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/improving-swine-welfare","Improving Swine Welfare: Addressing Gaps in Good Animal Husbandry Practices (GAHP) among Smallholder Farmers in Pontevedra, Capiz, Philippines By: Jimboy Asoy and Kate Lupango | June 2024 The welfare of farm animals is pivotal to animal product quality, yet it is often compromised by various factors including farmers' capacities, drives, and goals. Farmers' attitudes towards animal welfare are shaped by their values, beliefs, and experiences. The Animal Welfare Act of 1998, as amended by RA 10631, outlines the standards for animal well-being, emphasizing the need to prevent abuse, ensure proper care, and allow animals to exhibit normal behavior. In the Philippine swine industry, a significant portion of production is managed by backyard farmers, who constitute 67.5% of the swine population. Despite their crucial role, government policies on animal welfare mainly target commercial farms, leaving smallholders at risk of engaging in harmful practices. The Voiceless Animal Cruelty Index of 2020 highlighted the need for better animal protection legislation in the Philippines, which ranked 19th globally with a performance rating of ""E"". To address this, the Bureau of Agriculture and Fisheries Product Standards (BAFPS) developed the Code of Good Animal Husbandry Practices (GAHP), providing guidelines for proper animal rearing. However, the implementation of GAHP at the local level remains challenging, especially among backyard farmers. This study aims to investigate the application of GAHP among local swine raisers in Pontevedra, Capiz, identifying gaps and recommending evidence-based interventions to improve animal welfare and management practices. The study's objectives include describing current husbandry practices, identifying gaps in GAHP adoption, and proposing interventions to enhance compliance and support animal welfare.","text",6
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/improving-swine-welfare","This research will assess the capacities, constraints, and attitudes of local farmers towards GAHP, providing insights for policy development and effective implementation strategies.","text",7

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/womens-month-feature-marielle","IMy name isMarielle Racoma,I’m the founder of Our Endangered PH, a conservation photographer, plus-size model, and singer-songwriter. I stopped eating meat in 2019 as a pescetarian, then transitioned to vegetarianism 4 years ago in 2020. As I started Our Endangered, I needed to commit to advocating for the rights of all animals and believed I couldn’t do this effectively without first becoming plant-based. Why do you think it’s important to advocate for farmed animals? Farmed animals are amongst the most neglected sectors in the animal community; being seen only as money-making machines and not for the individuals that they are. Chickens, pigs, and ducks are some of my favorite animals and it’s heartbreaking to witness how little their worth is to society. Millions, if not billions, are killed everyday so I want to be a catalyst for changing the narrative of farm animal advocacy in our country. Speaking up for these animals is so important to combat climate change, conserve wildlife, and to spare so many other species from being killed for only a few minutes on a plate. What farmed animal advocacy or plant-based initiatives are you currently doing or planning to do? I just reached a personal milestone of 4 years of being plant-based, and I’m planning on deepening my passion for farmed animal and endangered species advocacy by pursuing this work professionally with Our Endangered and similar organizations. If you could share with us, like one story in your farmed animal advocacy journey that has touched you so well and you still remember, please share here. Feel free to add links, photos, a video, etc. I used to have a pet duck named Harmony when I was growing up, and I considered her my best friend (along with my dogs). We were very fond of each other and she’s the reason why I stopped eating duck as a child. I remember coming home from school and she would always waddle up to greet me everyday.","text",7

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/field-notes-capiz","Field Notes: Meeting the smallholder farmers of Pontevedra, Capiz By Enzo Bautista Understanding someone's experiences goes beyond mere observation; it necessitates total immersion into their realities. As an advocate for animal welfare, I've long understood the significance of not just advocating from a distance but also delving deep into the heart of the matter. Despite my dedication to these causes, I found myself relatively new to the complexities of farmed animal advocacy. Realizing this gap in my understanding, I felt compelled to broaden my knowledge proactively. I recognized that advocating for change without firsthand insight into the industry's inner workings would inherently limit my effectiveness. Thus, I accepted the opportunity to immerse myself in the farmed animal advocacy movement, aiming to witness its realities firsthand. The trip to Capiz served as a microcosm of the broader agricultural landscape,offering invaluable insights into the challenges encountered by animals and advocates. Being physically present allowed me to transcend mere statistics and headlines, gaining a nuanced perspective that would significantly inform my advocacy efforts.","text",5

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/field-notes-capiz","However, there existed a noticeable disparity in the level of care provided, primarily influenced by the resources available to the caretakers. While all farmers had a basic understanding of animal husbandry, adhering to regulations posed challenges, resulting in breaches and lapses in animal welfare standards. One of the project's key objectives was to pinpoint these gaps in animal health and welfare. The firsthand observations of backyard enclosures shed light on areas for improvement and highlighted the pressing need for interventions to enhance animal well-being.","text",15

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/field-notes-capiz","Participating in the focus group discussion was a fascinating experience. Unlike the typical approach of smaller, more manageable groups, our session involved a more extensive gathering of ten participants. This decision was made to enhance efficiency and accommodate the farmers' comfort, resulting in a lively and vibrant discussion. Despite the language barrier, it was evident that all the farmers were deeply passionate about the well-being of their animals. While it might be easy to assume that this concern stems solely from the animals' role as a means of livelihood, the data gathered by the project suggests otherwise.","text",19

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/field-notes-capiz","For these smaller farmers, animal husbandry appeared to be more than just a source of income—it was a tradition, a common practice, and even a passion. The pigs were treated as companion animals until reaching a critical point where economic considerations necessitated their sale. This observation underscores these farmers' genuine empathy for the animals in their care. While further insights will be revealed in the research report, it's heartening to witness such empathy among these farmers. Despite the context of animal husbandry, there is a palpable sense of hopefulness surrounding the project. It has the potential to serve as a beacon for the future of animal advocacy in the Philippines, charting a course toward a more compassionate and ethical approach to animal welfare.","text",21

Engaging with myriad viewpoints and ideologies, I adeptly navigated the multifaceted nature of the issue, garnering a deeper appreciation for its nuances. Farmed animal advocacy presents a formidable challenge on a grander scale, particularly when confronted with the realities faced by farmers and stakeholders deeply intertwined with these animals. The GAHP initiative, however, provided a window into ethical treatment practices and burgeoning developments in local advocacy, offering a promising interim solution to confront the hurdles encountered by farmed animals.","text",23

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/womens-month-feature-em","Shell-o! I am Em Quintana, also known as The Vegan Mermaid in the Philippines. I have been mermaiding since 2013 both performing as a mermaid and teaching mermaid classes. When in human form, I am a registered nurse by profession currently serving the community of Barangay Rosario in the City of San Pedro, Laguna. I became vegan primarily for health reasons, but living with a cat made me contemplate on a lot of things and I began researching deeper about veganism. My cat made me realize that how can I love one and eat the other? Since then, I am vegan for the animals and promised myself to advocate and dedicate my life for them in this lifetime. Why do you think it’s important to advocate for farmed animals? As humans, we have the moral responsibility to take care of every Kind in this planet - humans and non-human animals alike. Farmed animals do not speak our language and we can actually do so much for them by empathizing and speaking their realities as fellow sentient beings. Taking advantage of them in immoral ways means neglecting our responsibility as the highest and most intelligent species on Earth. Their demise is our demise, too. They are connected to us and we to them. What we do to them, we do to ourselves and our planet because everything is connected. WE ARE CONNECTED. What farmed animal advocacy or plant-based initiatives are you currently doing or planning to do? This year, I promised myself to get out there and do more for the animals by doing more volunteer work for NGOs like AEP, Metro Manila Save, and PETA. I also signed the petition to endorse the Plant Based Treaty and have been encouraging people to sign up and endorse it, too. I take advantage of social media to share facts, as well as my personal experience about farmed animal advocacy in the hopes of enlightening and encouraging fellow humans to empathize with them.","text",7

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/womens-month-feature-em","What is your message to other farmed animal advocates, especially the women and young girls? Dear Fellow Advocates, Women and Young Girls, Begin with knowing your purpose. Advocating for farmed animals can be challenging, which is why it is important to know WHO you are doing it for and WHY you are doing this. When you know your purpose, establish it, grow with it, and you will be able to see and appreciate that advocating for others is a selfless purpose. Most people will not be welcoming at all. Please be patient with them for they haven’t grasped the realities of what’s happening in the animal industry. It may take time, please be patient. May you always choose to be kind, compassionate, and empathetic without forgetting YOU. Connect with like-minded people who are in your same wavelength. It is important to have a support group that will listen, understand, and also advocate for you. If it becomes overwhelming, it is okay to pause and rest. Breathe. Find your peace. Please don’t forget to make yourself a priority, so you can still continue on advocating for farmed animals. Always remember that we can never attain to do this perfectly and people might view you as the “perfect” one and you will hear uncomfortable opinions from them. When this happens, please go back and remember your WHOs and your WHYs. This will keep you grounded. The animals and the planet need us. We are their only hope. You got this! I’m proud of you! Love always, Em","text",15

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/womens-month-feature-stef","My name isStef dela Cruz.I’m a retired doctor, editor-in-chief of a magazine about animals, and Animal Alliance Asia’s Philippine Coordinator. Seven years ago, I was admitted to the hospital for an extremely painful condition that I’ve had since I was young. My intestines stopped working because of the illness and started ballooning, almost ready to burst. I thought I would die. In fact, part of me wanted to, because I didn’t think the intolerable pain would ever go away. It took more than a week for me to finally become well enough to be discharged. I was still in pain for weeks after leaving the hospital. Recovery was slow, but the prolonged agony made me realize that suffering of that severity wasn’t something I wanted others to ever experience. I was aware that what I had was a second chance in life. I then started growing different plants in my garden, just to reorient myself to life once again. The more my garden flourished, the more I had “visitors”: bees, fireflies, and even a hummingbird! It then started to dawn on me that even the insect visitors in my balcony garden — deemed as pests by many — were deserving of life, just like me. They just wanted to survive, just like I did. I realized that I liked the idea of respecting life instead of taking it. As much as I could, I shared my edible garden with different creatures, even if it meant that many of my plants would not have perfect flowers and leaves. I also started making my own oat milk and enjoying food that didn’t come from animals. And by the time some of my friends told me about veganism, I didn’t need convincing: I already knew that going vegan was what I had always wanted to do even though I didn’t know it before then. It took less than a month after becoming a vegan for me to become an active animal justice advocate. Why do you think it’s important to advocate for farmed animals? There are many reasons!","text",7
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/womens-month-feature-stef","The first that comes to mind is that unlike other justice issues, animal justice is not as accepted by society. When we talk about sparing the life of a pig, someone on social media will probably say, “Mmm, bacon!” and not feel any remorse.","text",8
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/womens-month-feature-stef","Animals are among the most silenced victims of oppression. In fact, we often erroneously refer to them as “voiceless” despite the fact that they do have a voice. For instance, we will definitely hear chickens screaming at the top of their lungs when they’re being slaughtered! And just because they do not speak any of our human languages, we think they can’t speak. They do; we just need to listen a bit more intently. This chronic silencing of animals, even by many of us who care about them, makes it all the more important for us to advocate for them. The women reading this right now can relate: We have a voice, but many of us are not being heard. Other reasons include the undeniable role of animal agriculture in driving climate change, the many harms of animal industries to the environment, the avoidable use of scarce resources for meat and dairy instead of crop agriculture, and the importance of acknowledging our non-supremacy over fellow sentients. There are many others; I’m sure your readers already know that so many issues we have as a society are actually connected to each other! What farmed animal advocacy or plant-based initiatives are you currently doing or planning to do? As Philippine Coordinator of Animal Alliance Asia, I helped design a nationwide advocate development program calledKain at Hain(Eat and Serve), where we build the skills of small vegan food businesses, make plant-based food more accessible to employees, and support crop farmers. This fellowship program gives a stipend worth Php 10,000 to each chosen advocate. The advocates will be coming from different regions, and they will be partnering with differentturo-turos(eateries) in formulating plant-based offerings, and with farmers from their respective regions. With this program, we hope to normalize the idea that animals don’t need to become ingredients for us to enjoy affordable, accessible, nourishing food!","text",9

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/womens-month-feature-stef","What is your message to other farmed animal advocates, especially the women and young girls? We are all too familiar with being mistreated and exploited, simply because we are women. As we realize our own power and learn to take up space, let’s think of others whose lives are full of misery simply because they are born the way they are, to no fault of their own. Of course, that includes non-human animals. And if you want to deepen your feminist values, try looking into how female cows are exploited in the dairy industry or how female chickens suffer in the egg industry. Their truths are horrific, but I am sure that their stories about how they’re exploited for their reproductive systems — stories often ignored but are quite relatable to anyone who identifies as female — will find a place in your heart.

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/womens-month-feature-roni","Hi! I’mRoni.I’m a registered nutritionist-dietitian. I specialize and advocate in plant-based nutrition. Through my private practice and Plants & Purpose,  I help Filipinos stop struggling and start transitioning to an adequate, balanced and sustainable plant-based lifestyle to achieve their optimal health. I became vegan in 2019,  a year after I gradually shifted to eating more plant foods, primarily because of learning so much about the health benefits of eating a predominantly whole foods plant-based diet. I also learned about the positive environmental impacts of this way of eating. I decided to completely avoid animal foods and support any forms of animal cruelty after watching the Earthling documentary. (I love watching documentaries and that was how I came across films advocating plant-based nutrition.) I watched the film crying (sobbing at some parts) the entire time. I chose to finish until the end because I feel that I have to see the whole of it to not be able to unsee it, and it’s still in my core memory. (To anyone who’s reading this and still planning to see the documentary, I strongly recommend it!) Why do you think it’s important to advocate for farmed animals? Advocating for farmed animals is the right thing to do for a number of reasons- to improve their living conditions, to reduce their suffering and hopefully, end any forms of animal cruelty and suffering. They’re voiceless so they need people to be their voice, to advocate for them. What farmed animal advocacy or plant-based initiatives are you currently doing or planning to do? I’m a nutritionist-dietitian and I’ve chosen plant-based nutrition as my chosen specialization and advocacy. It’s the core of my practice as a nutritionist-dietitian at Plants & Purpose. Offering my services and help in any way I can to vegans, vegetarians or anyone who’s planning to transition to a plant-based (or vegan) lifestyle is my little way to advocate for farmed animals.","text",7

I remember that it took me twice its length to finish watching it because I had to pause it several times. I was crying the whole time watching it, and I chose to finish it because I want to know the whole story of different forms of animal cruelty. What is your message to other farmed animal advocates, especially the women and young girls? Every little way that you can do to advocate for farmed animal counts. Practice compassion, not only to farmed animals, but also to yourself. You (We) are not alone as we are part of this growing movement as there are millions of people who share your (our) compassion for animals. I used to second guess myself if I’m doing enough. Should I be challenging myself to be out there joining the visible forms of activism? But then I learned about thedifferent roles activist and social movementsneed to play in order to successfully create social change. I’m a citizen at the moment and I’m comfortable with that. I’m alright with how I’m contributing to the vegan community but at the same time, I’m open to expanding and exploring other ways on how I can advocate for farmed animals.

Outside AEP, I help run Guinea Pig Shelter PH, a private foster home that provides temporary shelter for guinea pigs looking for forever families and advocates #AdoptDontShop. Why do you think it’s important to advocate for farmed animals? It’s important to advocate for farmed animals and other nonhuman animals because they are ourkapwa, i.e., we share the world with them. Another reason we must advocate for farmed animals is because their suffering is intricately linked to our existential possibilities. Animal agriculture is one of the leading drivers of climate change, and eating meat has always been linked to a number of diseases. To advocate the liberation of farmed animals is one of the most urgent moral imperatives today. What farmed animal advocacy or plant-based initiatives are you currently doing or planning to do? I am currently writing on animal ethics. My main goal in publishing this essay is to invite the Philippine philosophical community to reflect on the question of the nonhuman being. I am hoping that philosophy keeps up with the current ethical issues challenging our times and lives today. If you could share with us, like one story in your farmed animal advocacy journey that has touched you so well and you still remember, please share here. Feel free to add links, photos, a video, etc. Esther the Wonder Pigwas one of the reasons I advocate for farmed animals. It was in 2015 when I stumbled upon Esther's account on Instagram. Esther changed the way I see farmed animals so that in 2016, my New Year's Resolution was to stop eating red and white meat. She clarified to me what my values are, and I'm forever grateful to her for deeply changing my life. When she passed, I vowed that for the rest of my life, I will honor and celebrate her life by telling her story in the hope that people will finally see farmed animals as individuals with dignity.","text",7

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/meet-the-farmed-animals-in-the-philippines","Meet the Farmed Animals in the Philippines By Jane B. Did you know that the most common farmed animals in the Philippines have a lot to offer, more than just being farmed for food? This blog looks into the profiles of four farmed animals, namely pigs, cows, chicken, and fish! PIGS There are currently 6 breeds of pigs in the Philippines: The Landrace breed is white or pink in color and has small, droopy ears. Similar to the Landrace is the Large White. It is also white in color but has ears that are slightly erect as compared to that of the landrace. The Hampshire pig breed is black but has a white or pink ‘belt’ that runs from its neck to its front feet. Meanwhile, the Duroc is distinguished by its reddish to dark brown color. The Pietrain is a pig breed that is known for its black spots scattered around its white or pink body. Lastly, the Philippine native pig is a breed that’s resilient against sickness and can survive in natural environments.","text",5

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/meet-the-farmed-animals-in-the-philippines","Apart from the number of breeds that exist in the Philippines, did you know that there are far more interesting facts about pigs in general? For instance, pigs are said to be more intelligent than three-year-old humans. In fact,  these clever creatures possess an impressive ability to solve problems and communicate, using oinks, grunts, and squeals to convey their thoughts and emotions. If us humans also use various sounds to express pain, excitement, and other emotions, well, pigs prove that they can too! But… it doesn't stop there! Pigs can also be sly, employing tricks to outsmart each other in order to gain temporary food advantages. Everything for food, right? Thus, whether it's navigating mazes or devising creative solutions, pigs are creatures that never fail to showcase their remarkable intelligence and resourcefulness. COWS The Philippine cow originated from Chinese and Mexican cattle, and what makes it distinguishable is its small hump. Beyond their gentle demeanor and serene presence, cows possess fascinating behaviors and social dynamics.","text",7

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/meet-the-farmed-animals-in-the-philippines","How do you handle stressful situations? Talk to a friend? Eat your favorite food? Well, cows have their own coping mechanism in handling such scenarios: they lick each other to help remain calm in stressful situations. This soothing ritual reflects their strong familial bonds and their instinctual drive to nurture and support one another. These creatures also form social ""grooming partnerships,"" similar to the close relationships observed in chimpanzees. Through mutual grooming and affectionate interactions, cows reinforce bonds of trust and camaraderie within their herds, creating a harmonious environment for all. CHICKENS From Boholano to Darag, Philippine chickens bear the names of their localities with pride, reflecting their deep-rooted connection to the country’s diverse landscapes. Have you ever had a bestfriend that always comforts you in times of despair? Well, did you know that chickens are great comforters? In fact, they demonstrate empathy and they recognize stress in their fellow flock members. These perceptive creatures possess a keen awareness of each other's emotions, offering comfort and support in times of need.","text",9

Chickens also exhibit strong individual personalities and form lasting friendships, forging deep connections that enrich their lives. As they anticipate the future and adjust their behavior to plan for it, chickens showcase a level of intelligence and foresight that continues to astound researchers and animal lovers. FISH In the blue waters surrounding our islands, fish flourish in abundance. Some of the most popular farmed fish in the country are milkfish, tilapia, grouper, shrimp, carp and catfish.","text",11

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/meet-the-farmed-animals-in-the-philippines","While most Filipinos see them primarily as food, did you know that fishes actually experience emotions? In fact, they feel positive and negative emotional states, similar to mammals and other animals. From joyous playfulness to profound sorrow, fishes navigate a rich spectrum of emotions that shape their lives and interactions. Apart from the fact that fishes feel emotions, they also enjoy playing games and even seek out human interaction, as if inviting us into their world. Or maybe they’re just wanderin' free, wishing they could be ~part of our world?~ Kidding aside, fish also pass down cultural knowledge from generation to generation. For example, when a fish swims alongside a shoal along a particular route, it learns and retains that path, which it then follows when navigating independently. PARTING WORDS As we reflect on the beauty and talents of farmed animals in the Philippines, let us pledge to be stewards of their well-being and champions of their rights. Through our actions and advocacy, may we create a world where all creatures, great and small, are treated with the empathy that they deserve. References: Faunalytics.

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/what-good-will-you-do-this-march","You’re probably just like many others who missed this year’s Veganuary? Fret not, #MeatlessMarch may be perfect for you! But, what’s in it for you? Well, going meatless stretches even further than improving your health. In fact, it can help combat climate change. Meat production does have a significant impact on the environment, and researchers have found strong evidence that vegan diets offer substantial environmental benefits compared to diets containing meat and animal products. Consider this: going meatless is just as important as shifting to a hybrid vehicle. Animal agriculture, particularly cattle farming, is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is emitted in large quantities by livestock and is a significant driver of climate change. In fact, methane is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide in warming the planet. Thus, by adopting a plant-based diet, you can reduce your carbon footprint and help address climate change. Studies show that plant-based diets can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 70% compared to meat-heavy diets. If it’s good for the planet, it’s better for the farmed animals too! After all, if we truly love animals, we shouldn’t eat them right? Inthis newsletter, Lewis Bollard writes, “It’s weird, even infuriating, that most humans consider themselves animal lovers while allowing the greatest abuse of animals in human history to continue unchecked.” The reality is that the meat industry subjects animals to immense suffering, from cramped living conditions to painful slaughter practices.By opting for a meatless diet, you're taking a stand against animal cruelty and advocating for the welfare of these sentient beings. Lastly, this March, there's no better time to embrace a meatless lifestyle, especially with Lent underway. Since majority of the Filipinos are Catholics, #MeatlessMarch presents an ideal opportunity to fast and abstain from meat.","text",7
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/what-good-will-you-do-this-march","By forgoing meat during this season, you not only uphold personal religious traditions but also practice the values of compassion and sustainability.","text",8
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/what-good-will-you-do-this-march","Imagine being able to answer the question, ""What good did you do in March?"" without hesitation. By going Meatless this March, you'll not only improve your health and contribute to environmental preservation but also demonstrate compassion towards animals. And who knows? Your commitment to a meatless diet could influence others to reconsider their dietary habits. So, why not try Meatless March? It's a chance to make a positive impact on your health, the planet, and the lives of animals—all while exploring delicious plant-based meals. And you might just discover that adopting a meatless lifestyle is simpler and more rewarding than you imagined.","text",9

Among the AEP Volunteers present at the event, Jester de Torres reflected on his experience, who was at first feeling a bit nervous but somehow felt profound fulfillment after. He found himself amidst familiar faces from the AEP community while also forging new connections. Alongside fellow volunteer Jas, he conducted spontaneous interviews with Ateneans, delving into their perspectives on animal-human relations. During these interviews, Jester discovered a spectrum of sentiments. As he narrated, “Several answers pertained to animals asking for their needs, such as food, shelter, etc. These answers are inspired by the interviewees' pets or companion animals. Truly, when people are asked about animals, they think of their companion animals or animals they have had a bond or connection with for a long time. Some answers referred to ""setting animals free"" or ""reducing their suffering,"" with the premise of farmed animals being caged or living under unnatural conditions. They thought of this answer because of their prior knowledge of factory farming and even animal testing for human products (specifically, make-up). Some mentioned that their families have farms and are aware of some harmful practices in farming. Some mentioned that they have seen animals suffering in the media.” Jester found encouragement in the genuine interest displayed by many Ateneans towards animal advocacy, fostering optimism for the future of animal welfare in the Philippines. Reflecting on his experience, he recognized parallels between himself and the individuals he encountered. Like many college students, he is navigating a path towards living a purposeful life with a biocentric perspective.","text",9

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/in-the-heart-of-advocacy-aep-volunteers-reflect-on-animal-welfair-2024","Jester also expressed gratitude for events like AGILA's Animal WelFair, emphasizing the importance of such platforms in fostering dialogue and action around animal welfare. He hopes for more such events in the future, providing opportunities for collaboration and growth within the Filipino animal advocacy community. Together with Jester, Jas also shared her experience at the event, which she describes as both empowering and transformative. Jas emphasized the rarity of feeling genuinely valued by an organization, highlighting the importance of personal connections over transactional interactions. This sense of belonging motivates her to further engage in animal welfare efforts, and to be connected with the AEP community at the very least. When asked about her realizations in his experience, Jas shared, “Somehow, it reaffirmed the crucial and destabilizing role of shame for those starting or are completely unfamiliar with animal welfare, as implied by some of the fairgoers’ reluctance and hesitancy to be interviewed. While there are existing efforts to make the concepts accessible and digestible, hopefully, we also get to respond better and with empathy to the “affect” side of communicating the advocacy.” Moreover, Jas challenged the notion of animal welfare as distant or irrelevant to daily life, emphasizing the inherent connection between humans and farmed animals. She suggested that recognizing this connection can bridge the gap between advocacy and everyday choices, encouraging individuals to make more informed decisions. Jas's reflections underscore the importance of empowerment, understanding, and relevance in driving meaningful engagement and change within the animal welfare movement. Overall, the reflections of AEP volunteers at Animal WelFair 2024 provided insights on how we can drive meaningful engagement within the local farmed animal welfare movement.","text",11

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/anthropomorphism-and-animal-empathy","Anthropomorphism and Animal Empathy Written byZian Bonoan an·thro·po·mor·phismthe attribution of human characteristics or behavior to a god, animal, or object. The term “anthropomorphism” was first used by the Greek philosopher Xenophenes to describe people’s tendency to project human attributes onto their deities. Gods who were believed to be mighty and ever-powerful were also described to be subject to human emotions like happiness, anger, or jealousy. Just as their wrath can erode entire civilizations, their love can rebuild new ones. With what can only be described as unfathomable entities, even our gods can’t escape the anthropocentric lens we view the world through. This is to say that we have a natural tendency to seek similarities to non-human animals and inanimate objects [1]. From the way we clothe our pets to the moving and talking fruits on children’s television shows, anthropomorphism is everywhere. We name our plants, cars, hurricanes and sometimes go so far as to assign certain personalities to them. However,anthropomorphism goes well beyond the identification of human characteristics. It also strongly influences the way we treat these anthropomorphized objects and animals[1]. In the story of “The Giving Tree”, for example, the generosity and love the tree so readily afforded to a man who exploited it evoked feelings of sadness and pity from the reader. Hearing a dog cry out in what we would interpret as an expression of pain would also elicit a sense of alarm and need to aid the animal.","text",5

"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/anthropomorphism-and-animal-empathy","Illustration by Zian Bonoan How can anthropomorphism play a role in animal welfare? “Perhaps the most important implication of anthropomorphism is that perceiving an agent to be human renders it worthy of moral care and consideration”[2] Surely if anthropomorphism can encourage empathy to non-humans then perhaps it is worth using it to normalize their appropriate treatment especially in places and industries where they are not usually afforded this. A study by Schobin et al. was done to observe university students’ food choices through displaying the main component of each dish in an anthropomorphized image for one group and a non-anthropomorphized image for the other. Their aim is to develop an intervention that is less intrusive to people’s choices by not constraining it, but providing a structure that nudges them towards more environmentally sustainable choices. Their findings suggest that students were less likely to choose beef and chicken meals when the visual display on the menu was anthropomorphized. It is in cases like these where anthromoporphism can be used in favor of animals and to develop a consciousness and moral concern for their wellbeing. How can Anthropomorphism be harmful? However, there is also reason to believe that the anthropomorphism of animals may do more harm than good in certain cases.There is the danger of misinterpreting their behavior and acting upon one’s false assumptions.This can lead to improper treatment and handling of animalsdespite good intentions. According to Mota-Rojas et al. our interpretive biases to psychologically and emotionally connect can deter us from acknowledging an animal’s true emotions, needs, and motivations. An example of this is how despite the efficient ability of dogs to thermoregulate, pet owners still find it necessary to clothe their companion animals. Especially his can lead to a heatstroke and in more severe cases, death.","text",7
"https://www.animalempathy.ph/blogs/anthropomorphism-and-animal-empathy","The misinterpretation of animals can also lead to a false understanding of their natural behaviors particularly among children who are still developing a basic comprehension of the world around them. Media suited for children normally portray animals in an unrealistic fashion. Patricia Ganea et al. studied the effect of anthropomorphism in children’s books to a child’s ability to retain knowledge on the animals present in the story.
