"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","The idea of divestment has been growing in popularity in recent years. A divestment campaign aims to persuade aligned institutional or individual investors to eliminate investment in any companies involved in specific controversial activities. Divestment is a kind of social impact investing or socially responsible investing, where the aim is to achieve social goods as well as economic returns from investing.","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","In the context of animal advocacy, this may be a campaign for full divestment from animal agriculture or divestment from companies in the sector with low Environmental, Social, Governmental (ESG) scores, which are used to encourage better practises in the industry(Scott, 2021). Divestment can target institutional or individual investors purchasing a company's stocks, venture capital or angel investors, or banks or other financial institutions that provide loans to these companies.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Divestment works by stigmatising the targeted industry, leading investors to believe that not only is divestment from the specific industry morally required, it also makes financial sense.","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","This report analyses this topic from the perspective of an organisation looking to start a new campaign. It tries to answer the question of if a new divestment campaign would be optimal or if another campaign would be preferable.","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","The total market value of shares in animal agriculture is over $3 trillion globally(Staista, no date; The Business Research Company, no date; Dent, 2021). Despite the substantial size of the industry, there are a host of moral issues within it, all of which could be the basis for a divestment campaign. These issues include poor animal welfare, reduced human health, human rights violations, and harmful environmental impact. These issues may threaten the future financial performance of the industry.","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY","text",17
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","We can examine the direct impact of divestment campaigns through either a theoretical or an empirical analysis. Starting with a theoretical approach, economic theory suggests that divestment may not have strong direct impacts on the cost of capital. This is because in an efficient market if an individual does not buy a stock, the stock will become undervalued, incentivising someone else to buy it instead.","text",18
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","The results of empirical research align with the predictions of this theoretical  model, with research typically finding short-term, but not long-term, effects.In less efficient markets, such as the market for angel investing, there are likely to be stronger direct effects.","text",19
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","There are also alternative theories that suggest that markets are less efficient than this. If true, these theories would suggest divestment will have stronger direct effects. However, the argument for these theories is not as strong, and even these theories may not predict long-term changes in value from divestment.","text",20
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Many divestment activists acknowledge the theoretical and empirical evidence against divestment campaigns having an effect on the cost of capital. Instead, they view theindirecteffects of divestment as the primary benefit of these campaigns(Hestres and Hopke, 2020).The two main indirect effects that academics and activists have focused their evaluation on are stigmatisation of the target industry and movement building.","text",21
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Stigmatisation of the target industry delegitimises the industry in the eyes of the public. Other people or organisations who associate themselves with the industry risk becoming stigmatised themselves and therefore may break off association, negatively affecting the target industry. For example, many organisations severed ties with South Africa during apartheid, perhaps as a result of the divestment campaign against it.","text",22
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Another important indirect effect is that divestment campaigns appear to be very popular and have good movement building potential. This is especially true given the soaring popularity of the fossil fuel divestment movement. A campaign to divest from animal agriculture could potentially ride on its coattails, helping make this probably one of the strongest arguments for a divestment campaign.","text",23
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","However, these historical cases do not allow us to easily isolate the causal effect that the campaigns are having. This is important because without being able to isolate the effect, we cannot cleanly compare a divestment campaign to the effect that another type of campaign would have had or what would have happened if there had been no campaign at all. This limits our ability to be confident that any campaign truly had an impact.","text",24
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","If our main focus is these indirect effects, as existing evidence suggests it should be, there are two additional reasons to believe that divestment could be a suboptimal campaign for animal advocacy organisations:","text",25
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Animal advocacy organisations already have tried and tested methods for stigmatising animal agriculture, including vegan (or reducetarian) outreach, corporate campaigns, and policy change campaigns. These campaigns may lead to the same indirect effects that provide the strongest support for a divestment campaign. Moreover, there is also a better case for significant direct effects from these campaigns.","text",26
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","The arguments that would be most persuasive in encouraging people to divest from animal agriculture highlight its environmental impact. This is also currently the most widely-used argument encouraging people to divest from animal agriculture. However, this framing could pose an animal welfare problem. The farming of large animals, especially cows, has a much larger environmental impact than the farming of smaller animals. Therefore, a divestment campaign that was not careful to avoid this might well disproportionately affect the farming of large animals. This in turn risks shifting consumption to smaller animals, increasing the total number of animals farmed for food, since many more small animals must be raised to produce the same amount of meat as a large animal.","text",27
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","In summary, though this is a complex topic with many uncertainties,we think the existing evidence in favour of the theory of change for divestment campaigns is too weak to invest significantly in such campaigns. Although given the uncertainty surrounding the relative efficacy of the movement-building and stigmatisation effects of different campaigns, additional empirical research could update us positively towards this campaignAny divestment campaign that is carried out should be particularly mindful of the small-animal replacement problem (point  2 above) to minimise the chance of the campaign being directly harmful.","text",28

"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","In order to explain the theory for the possible effects of divestment, we must first explain some economic concepts.","text",31
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Publicly traded companies are companies that are listed on the open market. When companies become publicly traded, they raise money by selling shares of the company in an initial public offering (equity financing through selling stocks) or through borrowing money (debt financing). Afterwards, the stocks are traded between investors on a secondary market. Many markets are electronically linked together into a total market that is very large. Anyone with the funds is, in principle, able to access the market and buy from it(Hayes, 2021a).","text",32
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Stock prices are determined by supply and demand. The lower the demand for the stock is, the lower the price for that stock. Conversely, the higher the supply of that stock, the lower the price for that stock(Fernando, 2021).","text",33
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","To say that a market is efficient is to say that the prices already incorporate available information. Under this model, if a person has information that a certain stock is undervalued, they can take advantage of that information by buying the stock until that stock is no longer undervalued(Downey, 2021; Tarver, 2021). The market is then said to have incorporated the available information. Since publicly traded stocks are in principle accessible to everyone, they can be viewed as incorporating all existing information.","text",34
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Under these assumptions, theory suggests that the direct effects of divestment should be minimal. This is because in an efficient market, if people divest from a particular stock, demand will decrease and therefore the price of that stock will become lower. Morally neutral investors will then buy it instead in order to make a profit on the undervalued stock. If the market is efficient in this way, opportunities like this will be seized by morally neutral investors, and any damage to company equity will be limited to the very short-term.","text",35
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Of course, this theoretical model may be unrealistic in practice. If the market for all opportunities were efficient in this way, it would not be possible to outperform the market since all opportunities would have already been taken. However, despite a great deal of noise in the sample because of the highly variable performance of stocks, the strong track records of some investors suggests that they have outperformed the market(Downey, 2021). Nevertheless, publicly traded stocks come closest to meeting this ideal of an efficient market. What is most likely is that stock markets are mostly efficient, but not completely so, leaving some room for divestment to have a small direct effect.","text",36
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Furthermore, given stocks are traded in secondary markets, the primary effect of divestment would be on the finances of shareholders rather than the company itself. However, if a company decides to sell more stock then a lower price will be quite problematic for them. So even if divestment was successful in reducing the stock price of the targeted industry, the effect on company cash flow might not be large(Brest and Born, 2013; Hillebrandt, 2018). An analysis of the credit of large oil companies found that they were not forced to pay a premium compared to  other companies in order to raise funds, and their activities and operations were essentially unchanged(Gan, 2019).","text",37
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","In cases where the market is much less efficient, this argument does not apply. In these cases, divestment will have much stronger direct effects(Ansar, Caldecott and Tilbury, 2013). The principal example of this is debt financing. Debt financing is particularly important because it provides more cashflow to most companies than equity(Gan, 2019). For the oil and gas sector, it is estimated that debt financing provides 9.5 times as much financing as equities(CNN, no date). The market for debt financing centres on a small number of large banks (amounting to 40% of the market) and is generally less liquid (less trading is done) than equity financing(Ansar, Caldecott and Tilbury, 2013; Quigley, Bugden and Odgers, 2020). This should make the market for debt financing at least somewhat less efficient than the market for equity financing.","text",38
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","This is supported by more empirical evidence of a stronger direct effect of divestment on access to debt financing. Cojoainu et al.(2019)studied the effects of divestment announcements on debt financing for fossil fuel companies. They found that for every 1% of assets under management divested from fossil fuels, there was an associated 0.11% decrease in debt financing for fossil fuel companies in that country.","text",39
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","The other two examples of these are angel investing and investing in emerging markets. Emerging markets are less efficient because there are fewer other investors in the space and because the markets are often more difficult to access(Cajueiro and Tabak, 2004). The other principle example is angel investing, where substantial seed funding is given to a startup organisation before that organisation is publicly traded(Ganti, 2021). In this case, the investment provided is far less replaceable as a failure to acquire initial investment can greatly diminish the growth of the company or force it to shut down entirely.","text",40
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Empirical evidence for increases in the cost of capital","text",41
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Empirical evidence generally does not support strong direct effects from divestment(Bergman, 2018; Gan, 2019). There is clear evidence for short-term effects on share price from divestment, but little evidence of any longer-term effects(Ansar, Caldecott and Tilbury, 2013; Ţiţan, 2015; Dordi and Weber, 2019). For instance, Hillebrandt and Halstead(2018)write that:","text",42
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","“There is clear evidence of short-term market inefficiency such that impact investors can affect stock prices on the timescale of around 3 months. There is expert disagreement about whether socially responsible investing is likely to have an effect after 6 months and beyond: some economists hold that the effect will be completely offset, some that more than half will be offset, and some that a substantial fraction of the effect might persist beyond 6 months.”","text",43
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Effects that are limited to the short-term are what we might expect as the market reacts to undervalued equity. Here are some additional relevant studies and reviews supporting this claim:","text",44
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Dordi and Weber(2019)specifically analyse the case of divestment. They analyse the effect of 24 announcements of divestment on the share prices of 200 fossil fuel companies. They found that the announcements of divestment did affect the share price of the fossil fuel companies, but they were unable to make a judgement of effects beyond 10 days due to confounding effects.","text",45
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Titan(2015)discusses evidence of some market inefficiency in the short-term. This is based on studies finding that investors were able to continue to get abnormal returns within a period following the announcement of information that indicated there should be abnormal returns on this investment.","text",46
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Patel and Welsh(2017)found that the price increase companies experience from being added to the S&P 500 disappears almost  completely after six months. This price increase happens arbitrarily since when companies are added, investments that track the S&P 500 automatically invest in them. This case shows an initial market inefficiency being corrected over the course of six months.","text",47
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","As such, this evidence favours market efficiency in the long run (but not necessarily the short run) for publicly traded stocks(Ansar, Caldecott and Tilbury, 2013). These short-term fluctuations in stock prices are unlikely to be as consequential to companies as long-term, compounding devaluation of stock prices. Divestment would therefore have minimal direct impact under this interpretation.","text",48
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","However, there is some evidence that public markets are not completely efficient. Pastor et al.(2020)find that dominant preferences  have some effect on the price of stocks, with “green” stocks having higher than expected prices. This may be because investors are willing to pay more for the stocks because of a moral preference, lowering the cost of capital for these companies. Circiretti et al.(2019)find that stocks from firms with low ESG ratings (“sin stocks”) perform better than other stocks. This suggests that the stocks are undervalued, perhaps because people have a preference for less harmful stocks, and that the market has not taken advantage of this opportunity.","text",49
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Critical mass hypothesis for the cost of capital","text",50
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Even if divestment does have an effect, having a significant effect may still depend on convincing a critical mass of investors to divest. The idea is that once the divestment reaches a certain point, norms in the market begin to shift, pushing further divestment and reinforcing the process(Ansar, Caldecott and Tilbury, 2013). How large this critical mass has to be is unclear. However, given even fossil fuel divestment campaigns have not been successful in achieving majority divestment, this is likely to be difficult.","text",51
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Further, Ansar et al.(2013)suggest that a kind of wave structure describes how divestment occurs. Within each past divestment movement, they suggest that divestment comes in three waves. This begins with religious and public groups, then runs through universities and public institutions, and finally is followed by the wider market. A wave structure suggests that acts of divestment short of a critical mass may still influence others to divest, potentially leading to the next wave of divestment until the critical mass required to affect the cost of capital is achieved.","text",52

"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","The case for indirect effects is stronger. Indeed, activists generally view these effects as the primary reason to pursue divestment campaigns(Bergman, 2018; Hestres and Hopke, 2020). These indirect effects centre around a stigmatisation process. The industry is attacked and delegitimised, with its social sanction to operate revoked. Confidence in the industry and its future is undermined.","text",54

To the extent to which the ""stranded assets"" arguments are correct, these industries would already be at serious risk and we should expect them to have poor counterfactual financial performance. The divestment campaign may help the market incorporate this information more quickly, but the market would likely have reacted eventually anyway.","text",124
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","This could explain away the apparent success of divestment campaigns. If divestment campaigners choose which industry to target based in part on the financial risk associated with the industry, it is hardly surprising if the industry ends up performing poorly. This makes it especially important to be able to isolate the effect that the divestment campaign is having. Unfortunately, there is almost no available evidence that tries to isolate the effects in this way.","text",125
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Because of the importance of a “tipping point”, there are probably not strong diminishing returns to work on divestment even if the campaign space were relatively crowded.","text",126
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","EXPERT INTERVIEWS","text",127
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","To complement our review of the evidence we interviewed some relevant stakeholders working in ESG investing, activists, as well as researchers who had previously examined the effects of divestment or impact investing. Among these individuals there was general agreement that the financial impact of divesting on the cost of capital of firms was small or negligible for any individual or small institution. However, they thought there might be a significant effect if a larger mass of capital is divested either from a large number of individuals or very large institutions. All the same, some did note that they had not observed this to date with the fossil fuel divestment movement. Given this is the most successful divestment movement ever, they were sceptical that a new campaign for Animal Agriculture could achieve this effect any time soon. An exception to this was debt denial strategies of divestment, which all experts thought had greater potential for a direct effect on the cost of capital, though  they were uncertain of the magnitude of this effect.","text",128
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","An area of disagreement amongst experts was the value and magnitude of indirect effects, and particularly stigmatisation. When looking at the effect this has had historically, all experts agreed that it was difficult, if not impossible, to disentangle the stigmatisation effect of these campaigns from the broader landscape of advocacy at the time. This makes the value of the stigmatisation effect particularly difficult to evaluate, leading to disagreement on the value of stigmatisation compared to other outcomes. However, when discussing alternative approaches for achieving stigmatisation available to the animal advocacy movement, they generally agreed that there was nothing particularly special about divestment for achieving this effect. Instead, other vegan outreach, undercover investigations, or corporate campaigns could achieve similar effects. The exception came from those more familiar with maximising media coverage, an important step to achieving stigmatisation. They thought that financial news outlets would be more likely to cover divestment announcements than the wider media would cover any other campaigns. One expert outlined the mechanisms they had used to maximise the stigmatisation effect of an institution they convinced to divest, explaining that similar institutions achieved much less media coverage even when they were as or more trusted. Their suggestion was that for many campaigns, stigmatisation could be achieved through intelligent use of the media rather than relying on the inherent nature of the campaign.","text",129

"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Market rationality versus irrationality","text",131
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","As discussed in the evidence section, the extent to which markets are rational versus irrational directly affects how effective we should expect divestment to be. Though the weight of evidence and the views of experts tend to favour the side of market rationality, this is still a large outstanding question in economics.","text",132
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Some experts argue that the extent to which markets are efficient is exaggerated. The Keynesian beauty contest is one theory of market irrationality. This argues that stock prices are determined as a sort of popularity contest, rather than being an independent reflection of their true value. Under this theory, picking the right stock should not involve finding the “true value” of the stock to see if it is undervalued; it just involves assessing what other people think the best stock is(The Decision Lab, 2021).","text",133
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Examples of so-called irrational exuberance — cases where what looks like pure enthusiasm drives up the price of the stock – argue in favour of market irrationality(Hayes, 2021b). The differing performance of many cryptocurrencies, which are almost exact functional clones of other cryptocurrencies except for the different names and framing of those cryptocurrencies, is strongly suggestive of a beauty contest. For example, Dogecoin was created as a joke and is functionally nearly exactly the same as bitcoin(Chohan, 2017). Despite not having any features to recommend it over any of the other clones of bitcoin, Dogecoin has a market capitalisation of$22 billionas of the time of writing.","text",134
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","To the extent to which this is true, divestment could be an effective strategy because it makes the stocks unpopular. The sagging popularity could in turn have a self-reinforcing effect causing it to lose more and more popularity. This could generate an effect that is the opposite of a bubble, causing significant harm to the targeted industry.","text",135
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","However, even some proponents of these popularity theories acknowledge that, in the long run, the true value of the stock is important(Keynes, 2002; NPR, 2011). There is, then, general agreement on the view that direct effects from divestment should be minimal in the long-term.","text",136

"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","The small animal replacement problem refers to the replacement of larger animals with smaller animals, thereby leading to an increase in total animal suffering(CE Team, 2018). Adding to the problem, there are typically lower welfare standards for smaller animals.","text",138
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Since most of the pressure for divestment comes from arguments based on the climate impact of animal farming, divestment may be more likely to target animal agriculture businesses with the highest carbon footprints. In particular, since cows have a much higher carbon footprint than other animals, this ask may differentially disrupt cow farming, raising  the price of beef and milk relative to other animal products. For example, Jeremy Coller, head of the FAIRR Initiative, coined the phrase “cows are the new coal”(Baker, 2021).","text",139
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","There are far fewer animals involved in cow farming to produce the same quantity of animal products and the welfare of larger animals is typically higher. Therefore, there is a risk of divestment causing an increase in animal suffering, or a smaller decrease than would otherwise be expected.","text",140
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","In order to try and avoid this, divestment campaigns should focus on a blanket divestment from all animal agriculture. However, because of the greater salience of the environmental arguments in the minds of most people, there is still a risk of the small animal replacement problem even from campaigns that try to avoid it. This is especially true if environmental arguments are often used in the campaign.","text",141
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","This may be a particularly pressing problem for divestment. Since divestment campaigns are meant to start a chain reaction of pressure against the industry, including inspiring media coverage and incentivising new activists to join the movement, the final results are not under the control of the activists who begin the divestment campaign. This means that even if activists are careful in their messaging to try and avoid the small animal replacement problem, the end result of the corporate and legislative changes may not be aligned with this.","text",142
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Investment based on ESG (environmental, social, governance) rating is one common approach that is lighter than full divestment. If this approach is taken, rather than a blanket disinvestment from animal agriculture, the farming of large animals may be differentially negatively affected because of their lower scores, again leading to the small animal replacement problem. There are some signs of this from the FAIRR Initiative. They rank aquaculture as outperforming all other sectors of animal agriculture across all risk factors(Shoup, 2021). Aquaculture represents the largest numbers of farmed animals as well as typically some of the lowest welfare standards. Any risk that divestment might inadvertently lead to the expansion of aquaculture should, therefore, be taken seriously.","text",143
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Further, in FAIRR’s writing to assess risks to investors of investing in animal agriculture, environmental arguments are much more prominent than animal welfare arguments(FAIRR, 2016). For example, animal welfare is only one of the 10 critical risk and opportunity factors listed in their FAIRR Protein Producer Index(FAIIR, 2021). Only one other factor, sustainable (alternative) protein, directly relates to animal welfare. In contrast, four of the factors are environmental.","text",144
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","If the investors are persuaded based on these or similar environmental arguments, it is likely that they will preferentially divest from animal agriculture involving larger animals like cows. This will differentially harm the farming of larger animals, likely shifting consumption to smaller animals with a consequent degradation in overall animal welfare.","text",145

"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Stakeholder advocacy refers to stakeholders in a company pushing for changes in that company. To the extent to which stakeholder advocacy is effective, it presents an alternative and opposing option for advocacy. Rather than divestment from the harmful industry, stakeholder advocacy suggests we should invest in that industry in order to be in a better position to push for changes to it. Indeed, the evidence for shareholder advocacy directly causing changes in corporate policy is much stronger(Kölbel et al., 2019), a finding that is at least somewhat at odds with divestment being an effective advocacy strategy.","text",147

Even 18% is substantial given the high value that many requests might have and the low cost of making a request.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","We think that, given the existing evidence, many existing animal advocacy campaigns will be more effective and less risky than divestment.","text",150
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","There are three principal reasons for this:","text",151
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","The evidence base for divestment is not strong and does not clearly support its efficacy. There is a lack of evidence that attempts to causally isolate the effects of divestment. Without this evidence, we cannot be sure that existing and previous divestment campaigns have caused the effects that are often attributed to them. Moreover, thereisevidence that the direct effects from divestment on the cost of capital are minimal.","text",152
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Within animal advocacy, there are already existing campaign types that involve the stigmatisation process but have stronger direct effects. The stigmatisation process does appear to cause real harm to the industry, but unlike in other cases like apartheid-era South Africa, there are other ways of achieving this in relation to animal agriculture.","text",153
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","More so than in other divestment movements, there is some risk of divestment from animal agriculture causing harm. This is because companies that farm larger animals will likely be more damaged by environmental arguments used to achieve divestment. This may shift consumption toward smaller animals, potentially increasing the total number of animals farmed.","text",154
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","The small animal replacement problem is the most significant remaining uncertainty given the risk it poses of the ask becoming of net harm. A better analysis attempting to model how likely this is to occur would be helpful. Additionally, a more thorough analysis of whether current divestment campaigns risk causing this problem would be helpful. It would also be very useful to find better evidence that more rigorously assesses the causality of divestment campaigns.","text",155
"https://www.animalask.org/post/divestment-from-animal-agriculture-what-does-it-achieve","Finally, though most advocates do not believe direct effects are the primary reason for pursuing divestment, a better understanding of the strength of the direct effects would also be valuable.","text",156

"https://www.animalask.org/post/non-stun-slaughter","Summary: In the UK, there is a legal requirement to stun animals before slaughter. Stunning, which can involve delivering an electrical current or percussive blow to the brain, ensures that the animal is rendered unconscious before they are killed. However, there is an exemption to the law for animals that are slaughtered in accordance with religious rites to be consumed by UK Jewish and Muslim communities.1 Each year approximately 108 million animals are slaughtered without pre-stunning in the UK using this provision. The vast majority of these animals are killed for halal-certified meat and the rest for kosher-certified meat. The majority of non-stunned animals are broiler chickens (~104 million) though many sheep, layer hens, turkey, goats, cattle, calves, and other poultry are also slaughtered without stunning.2 These exemptions are intended to meet the demand of faith communities. However, the production of non-stun meat exceeds demand from these communities, resulting in the unnecessary slaughter of millions of animals using these methods.","text",10

"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY","text",10
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","To do as much good for animals as we can, it is important to understand the systems that are causing animals to suffer and die - and how to reform those systems to help animals.","text",11
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","One way to reform modern animal agriculture is through subsidies. Subsidies are payments made by governments to businesses or people. Some subsidies can have profound effects on the lives of animals. For example, governments can pay farmers to produce more meat, which can harm animals. On the other hand, governments can pay farmers to adopt practices that improve animal welfare, which can help animals. Promoting or abolishing these subsidies could therefore be an effective way for animal advocacy organisations to do good for animals.","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","In this report, we examine five types of subsidy reforms in animal agriculture, and we evaluate which of these reforms could be impactful campaign options for animal advocacy organisations.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Promoting welfare-conditional subsidies appears to be an impactful campaign. This type of subsidy involves the government paying farmers to adopt higher-welfare practices. Evidence from Switzerland and the EU suggests that this type of subsidy can bring concrete improvements in animal welfare, and tentatively even reduce the production of animal products, so long as the subsidies are well-designed.","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Abolishing or reducing subsidies for meat production also has the potential to be an impactful campaign, but additional research is needed first and this is context-dependent. Initial studies suggest that abolishing these subsidies could decrease animal production. But there is also the risk that abolishing these subsidies could shift production away from cows and towards chickens, which could result in more animal suffering and death overall. Before any campaigns take place, a more sophisticated economic analysis is needed to provide more detail about the contexts in which this campaign could be good for animals.","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","The other three options we examined do not appear capable of helping animals. These options were abolishingsubsidies for feed crops, promoting subsidies for plant-based foods, and abolishing fisheries subsidies. Each of these three optionswould either achieve nothing or even possibly harm animals.","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","We recommend that animal advocacy organisations consider campaigning for welfare-conditional subsidies, by which farmers are paid for adopting higher-welfare practices. This could involve increasing these subsidies in places where they already exist (Switzerland, the EU, and England) or establishing them in further countries. And we note that although this is the most promising subsidy campaign, the context in a particular country will determine if this campaign has a higher impact overall than other animal advocacy campaigns.This campaign should be one of many that organisations systematically analysewhen considering which campaign would do the most good for animals.","text",17
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","We also recommend that a detailed economic study be conducted on the effects of abolishing subsidies for meat production. Such a study could unlock an opportunity for another high-impact campaign.","text",18
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Lastly, we conclude with some strategic considerations that may help organisations campaign for subsidy reform.","text",19

"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","WHAT ARE SUBSIDIES?","text",21
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","A subsidy is a payment made by the government to a company or person. Subsidies can take the form of direct payments; grants; tax concessions; cheaper loans or loan guarantees; infrastructure support, like servicing a road to a factory; and market price support, where the government raises the price of products artificially(1). Subsidies in some parts of society can do a lot of good, such as by promoting education and paying for scientific research. However, in animal agriculture, subsidies can have profound effects on the lives of animals for both good and bad.","text",22
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Background to subsidies in animal agriculture","text",23
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Subsidies in animal agriculture are a powerful policy tool that can influence production and consumption, thereby affecting the lives of animals¹.","text",24
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","On the producer side, governments can provide subsidies to farmers or processors of animal products(2). Chicken meat, pig meat, sheep meat, bovine meat, and eggs are all among the top ten most subsidised food products globally(2). Similarly, governments can provide subsidies to farmers who produce crops that are used to feed farmed animals(3,4). One well-studied and controversial example of crop subsidies is the programme in the US - in 2021, the US government spent USD 100 billion on farm support, and that farm support made up over 10% of the total money earned by farmers(5). These types of support may be direct (e.g. cash payment) or indirect (e.g. keeping prices at some artificial level to encourage production). Subsidies also exist in wild-caught fisheries, where government support can make fishing more profitable than it would otherwise be(6). Globally, these subsidies have been estimated at around USD 35 billion in 2009, with Japan, China, and the US together making up about one-third of that sum(6).","text",25
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Governments may also provide subsidies that encourage farmers to adopt higher-welfare practices. Switzerland and the European Union both have systems in which farmers can receive payments for implementing higher-welfare practices, and England is currently developing a similar system(7–9).","text",26
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","On the consumer side, governments can provide subsidies to reduce the price of particular foods, like fruits and vegetables, to incentivise people to buy more of those foods rather than animal products(10–13). Governments generally consider this type of policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or to promote human health, not to help animals(12).","text",27
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Options for reform","text",28
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Although there are a range of subsidies that affect the lives of animals, not all of these subsidies present effective avenues by which to improve the lives of animals. In this report, we focus on two key subsidy reforms that could be effective in helping animals. These are:","text",29
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Increasing subsidies that encourage producers to adopt higher-welfare practices. The evidence suggests that these subsidies can bring concrete improvements for animal welfare, and there is even tentative evidence that these subsidies can reduce the production and consumption of meat. We conclude that increasing these welfare-conditional subsidies has the potential to improve the lives of animals, so long as the subsidies are well-designed.","text",30
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Reducing subsidies that support the production of animal products. Although this reform looks promising, there needs to be additional research on the effects of this reform across the entire economy before the movement can be confident that this reform is an effective way to help animals.","text",31
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Other subsidy reforms have been proposed, but the evidence suggests that these are ineffective in helping animals (reducing subsidies for feed crops, increasing subsidies for plant-based foods, and reducing fisheries subsidies). At the end of this report, we will explain the reasons why these appear ineffective.","text",32
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","INCREASING WELFARE-CONDITIONAL SUBSIDIES","text",33
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Welfare-conditional subsidies involve the government giving subsidies to farmers who adopt particular practices that are better for animal welfare. For example, a government could make regular payments to farmers whose welfare practices exceed the legal requirements; or a government could make one-off grants to help farmers invest in the equipment needed for higher-welfare systems; or a government could make existing subsidies conditional on meeting new animal welfare requirements. To our knowledge, welfare-conditional subsidies currently exist in the EU and Switzerland, and they are also currently under development in England. A campaign could focus on increasing existing welfare-conditional subsidies paid inside these jurisdictions, amending those existing subsidies to do even more good for animals, or it could focus on establishing new welfare-conditional subsidies in further countries.","text",34
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Campaigning for welfare-conditional subsidies can improve the lives of animals in two ways (Figure 1). Primarily, these subsidies can directly encourage farmers to adopt higher-welfare practices or systems, which allow animals to be farmed in a way that causes less suffering. Indirectly, these subsidies can reduce the amount of animals that can be produced in a country (e.g. by reducing stocking densities or increasing the cost of production) - in some cases, this may lead to fewer animals being farmed overall. There is also a risk that this policy could switch production from larger animals to chickens, which would be bad for animals overall, but we think this is only a risk if the welfare-conditional subsidies are specific to large animals.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Bianchi(9)measured the effect of Switzerland's welfare-conditional subsidies on the production and consumption of meat from pigs, chickens, and bovines. The study analysed data on meat production between 1970 and 2013 (the RAUS and BTS schemes were established in 1993 and 1996, respectively). The study compared Switzerland's production to a synthetic control group composed of a weighted combination of neighbouring countries. This allowed the author to produce a counterfactual trend, which estimates how Switzerland's meat production would have evolved had the subsidies not been established.","text",53
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","The study concluded that Switzerland's production of both pig and chicken meat (but not bovine meat) were both lower than they would have been had the subsidies not been established. In 2010, the production of pig meat was about 60,000 tonnes (19%) lower than it would have been without subsidies; in the same year, the production of chicken meat was about 23,000 tonnes (27%) lower than it would have been without subsidies.","text",54
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","The study also found a similar decrease in the total domestic supply of meat, which rules out the possibility that the decrease in production was countered by an increase in imports; rather, the evidence shows that both production and consumption decreased. Switzerland's meat sector does not depend heavily on imports, which the author speculates may be because consumers have a strong preference for national products. A similar scenario could also arise if the domestic industry is protected through tariffs or quality standards. This study provides evidence that the welfare-conditional subsidies can reduce the overall number of animals farmed.","text",55

The authors conducted group and individual examinations to gather data on numerous welfare indicators, including lesions, lameness, respiratory disease, diarrhoea, ear biting, skin abnormalities, injuries, abscesses, sunburn, recumbency, ill-thrift, and behavioural abnormalities.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","The second example of welfare-conditional subsidies comes from the European Union (EU). In the EU, the key policy regulating agriculture is the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The CAP has a broad scope - it aims to provide income to farmers, improve productivity and food supply, and achieve a collection of goals for society, like addressing climate change and maintaining rural communities.","text",61
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","The CAP has some mechanisms by which subsidies are provided to farmers who protect animal welfare. There are two types of payments that farmers in the EU can receive for animal welfare(8). Pillar I payments are the standard payments received by farmers. These payments are reduced if farmers are found to be non-compliant with animal welfare legislation. Pillar II payments are additional payments for animal welfare practices that go beyond the existing legislation and aim to compensate farmers for lost income or costs incurred. Member States can choose to offer these Pillar II payments to their farmers(18).","text",62
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","However, when it comes to animal welfare, the CAP has a number of shortcomings. The CAP has been criticised as promoting an industrialised farming system, with negative consequences for animal welfare(19). Member States provide only a small budget for animal welfare payments at best, with many Member States providing no money for animal welfare at all(20)(Figure 2). The voluntary payments made by Member States are targeted towards dairy cows in most countries(21). This is at odds with the fact that, across the EU, farmed chickens, rabbits, and pigs are far more numerous(22,23). Ryland(24)calls the 2014-2020 implementation of the CAP 'disappointing' due to the failure to explicitly or directly improve farm animal welfare. This has only partially improved in the 2023-2027 implementation of the CAP, with animal welfare included under the heading of 'protect food and health quality'(25).","text",63
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Under the CAP, animal welfare is mostly addressed through rural development measures. The CAP measure best suited for voluntary improvements of animal welfare is M14 - Animal Welfare (under Pillar II)(8).

Successful examples have been most frequently identified for dairy cows - there are far fewer successful examples for pigs and chickens, and there are none for rabbits. For example, for chicken farms, measures have provided enrichment, free housing, microclimate control, outdoor access, and larger space allowances(8). On the other hand, there have also been unsuccessful examples - in some cases, voluntary schemes under M14 overlap with private certification schemes, meaning that the M14 payments do not bring any actual benefit. Worryingly, there have even been cases where M14 payments have been made to farms that do not even meet the minimum legal requirements for animal welfare.","text",68
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","There has been no monitoring and evaluation by the EU of the actual effects of M14 on animal welfare(26). It is unclear how many animals are covered by M14.","text",69
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","The European Economic Interest Group, in a report commissioned by the European Commission, concluded that Member States should implement more voluntary animal welfare measures to make the CAP more effective at improving animal welfare(8). This Group also recommended that such measures offer payments large enough to incentivise farmers to participate - farmers have often complained that payments are insufficient to justify adopting higher-welfare practices. In contrast, payments offered by Spain to sheep and goat farmers in Castilla La Mancha were sufficient to cover a high proportion of animals(8).","text",70
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","At the level of the EU, the CAP itself undergoes periodic reform, with the next reform scheduled for between 2025 and 2027(27). Although reform at the level of the EU may be preferable for various reasons (e.g. to avert concerns about making a single country's industry less competitive(28)), it is not plausible to reform the CAP outside of the specific reform period. Outside of that period, it would be far more tractable for organisations to work at the level of the Member State. Member States have the ability to establish payments for particular voluntary animal welfare commitments (Pillar II), and animal advocacy organisations can campaign for Member States to do so. However, these campaigns may also need to wait for particular time periods, as Member States generally develop their strategic plans for implementing the CAP in certain windows.","text",71

"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","This reform would abolish or reduce subsidies that support the production of meat or animal products. These subsidies can be implemented for many reasons, including to increase production of meat or animal products, to enable producers greater freedom in decision-making, and to manage the risk to producers(30).","text",89
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","There are two main ways that reducing subsidies for animal products can cause the number of farmed animals to decrease (Figure 3). Firstly, if there is an increase in the costs of production of a particular animal, the profit to producers would likely decrease. This would incentivise producers to move away from production of that animal, thus decreasing the number of individuals farmed. Secondly, a lower profit may cause an increase in the price of the animal product to consumers. This could cause consumers to demand less of that animal product, potentially also decreasing the number of individuals farmed.","text",90
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","However, there may also be complex economic effects that are not captured by these two pathways - the direction of such effects is unclear, so it may still be possible for this subsidy reform to be overall bad for animals. These economic effects are impossible to predict without a detailed economic model. To illustrate, later in this report, we discuss a different type of subsidy reform (reducing subsidy for feed crops). In that case, economic modelling revealed that unexpected economic effects could actually cause animal production to expand(31). The increase in production was due to complex cross-price effects on the market, as well as farmers and capital moving away from less-profitable crop production towards more-profitable animal production. These two mechanisms could plausibly apply to reducing subsidies for meat and animal products.","text",91
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","In particular, production could move away from larger animals, like cows and sheep, towards smaller animals, like chickens. This is a particular risk given that many subsidies supporting animal agriculture are specific to these larger animals. Farming chickens causes more suffering and more deaths for a given unit of meat, and chickens generally experience worse welfare conditions than cows and sheep (the 'small-animal replacement problem')(32–34).","text",92
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","For these reasons, reducing subsidies for meat and animal products could plausibly be overall bad for animals. It is also plausible that this risk would not materialise, and that reducing subsidies for meat and animal products would have the intended effect of helping animals. A modelling study that considers economy-wide dynamics could examine this risk and evaluate the circumstances under which production would increase. With that knowledge, the animal advocacy movement can make more informed decisions about whether, and in what contexts, to campaign for reducing meat subsidies.","text",93

"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Notably, there was an increase in the number of farmed chickens killed annually over that same period.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","This data relies on comparing production levels before and after New Zealand's subsidy reform. It is difficult or impossible to attribute the changes in production solely to the subsidy reform, as there would have been many other changes in agricultural practice and consumer preferences throughout that two-decade period. However, one could speculate: subsidies could be set up such that farmers are incentivised to produce one type of animal rather than another.

The simulations estimate that, using 2005 production and consumption values, the reforms caused beef production to decrease by 22% and beef consumption to increase by 8%.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","There are three other types of subsidy that have received interest in the animal advocacy movement. However, the evidence suggests that these types of subsidy reform would not improve the lives of animals.","text",112

"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Most of the debate on this topic has focused on the US. In the US, the federal government provides a large amount of subsidies for farming. Most of the farm subsidies in the US focus on commodity crops, like corn, soybeans, and wheat. These farm subsidies are controversial for numerous reasons(3).","text",114
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","The biggest buyer of these commodity crops are factory farms, as these crops are used as animal feed. For this reason, some people have suggested that abolishing crop subsidies could cause factory farming to become less profitable, which could reduce the number of animals who are farmed. If these crop subsidies were abolished, then the production costs of US factory farms could become 6-13% more expensive(3,4,38).","text",115
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Unfortunately, there are two reasons why abolishing crop subsidies would not reduce the production of animals. Firstly, the economy consists of complex dynamics across different products and markets - abolishing crop subsidies would cause complicated, unexpected results that would outweigh the effects on the costs of factory farms. Secondly, if crop farming becomes less profitable, resources (like capital and labour) would move to other types of farming, including animal agriculture(31).","text",116
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","In fact, one study did model the overall, economy-wide effects of abolishing crop subsidies. The study found that animal agriculture expands - the US would produce more chickens, more pigs, and more cows(31).","text",117
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Therefore, the evidence shows that reducing subsidies for feed crops is unlikely to help animals. Although this evidence focuses on subsidies in the US, similar dynamics are likely to hold in other countries. It is conceivable that there are countries where reducing subsidies for feed crops may indeed help animals. However, to have confidence that this is an effective campaign, a sophisticated economic model would need to show, under various sets of assumptions, that reducing these subsidies would reduce the number of animals farmed.","text",118

"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","It has been suggested that providing subsidies for plant-based foods (whether fruits and vegetables, or plant-based meat alternatives) could cause people to eat more of those foods and, accordingly, substitute away from meat.","text",120
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Unfortunately, economic studies have found that this generally does not happen. Subsidies for plant-based foods are unlikely to cause people to eat less meat and animal products(39). For fruits and vegetables, a systematic review concluded that there is no relationship between the price of fruits and vegetables and the consumption of meat and animal products(40). For plant-based meat alternatives, studies have found that consumers generally do not perceive plant-based meat alternatives as substitutes for animal-derived meats(11,41). Therefore, increasing subsidies for plant-based foods does not appear to be a useful intervention for improving the lives of animals. This may change in the future if people begin to perceive plant-based meat alternatives as legitimate substitutes for animal-derived meats(11).","text",121
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Reducing fisheries subsidies","text",122
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Subsidies in fisheries are already controversial from the perspective of biological conservation - these subsidies often allow fisheries to catch more fish than they otherwise would, which can contribute to fishing being economically and ecologically unsustainable(6). For this reason, there has been lots of effort, including talks at the World Trade Federation, to reform fisheries subsidies(42).","text",123
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","From the perspective of animal advocacy, reforming fisheries subsidies would be good if that reform caused fewer fish to be caught overall. Although the effects of fisheries subsidy reform vary depending on the specifics of the reform, it is common for reforms to have projected effects like: fishing effort is reduced; fewer fish are caught in the short-term; the size of the fish population grows; and more fish are caught in the long-term(42). In fact, allowing more fish to be caught in the long-term is often an explicit goal of these reforms.","text",124
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Fisheries subsidy reform would probably cause more fish to be brought into existence and more fish to suffer highly painful deaths by being caught in fisheries. This additional suffering would likely outweigh any benefits from fewer fish being caught in the short-term. As such, from the perspective of animal advocacy, it is not clear that this type of reform is good.","text",125

"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","We have discussed a number of times when agricultural subsidies have been reformed in various countries. These examples provide some lessons that may be useful to animal advocacy organisations campaigning to reform subsidies:","text",127
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Where subsidies are abolished, a primary motivation is to reduce government spending. For example, New Zealand's government was forced to eliminate agricultural subsidies in the 1980s because they had become too expensive(35), and Jordan's government was motivated to lift a feed subsidy in 2007 due to pressure on the national budget(43).","text",128
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Subsidies for meat production generally have environmentally harmful effects. These effects can provide further support and justification to campaigns seeking to abolish these subsidies(35).","text",129
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Some subsidy reforms are driven by pressures from the World Trade Organisation to reduce subsidies that directly support production. This was one motivation for a 2005 reform of EU-funded subsidies in the UK(44).","text",130
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","There are some examples of animal agriculture sectors in particular countries where most farms are economically unsustainable without subsidies. This appears to be the case for the goat sector in Greece and was also true of many farms in the UK in the early 2000s(44,45). Abolishing these subsidies could, therefore, cause major reductions in meat production. However, it is unclear whether governments would actually allow these industries to collapse in reality, as this would have profound implications for food supply and social well-being.","text",131
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Abolishing meat production subsidies can cause harm to people. New Zealand's subsidy reform did bring some social costs - some farmers were forced to draw on social welfare payments and the populations in some rural towns were reduced, although these both occurred less frequently than what was predicted(35). Tragically, there were also some suicides(35). In Jordan, the removal of the feed subsidy caused harm to the livelihood of some disadvantaged groups(43). Where subsidy reform risks causing harm to people, it is critical for reform to be accompanied by transitional assistance from the government to prevent this harm(35,43). The money that the government saves could also be spent on helping people in other ways.","text",132
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","CONCLUSION","text",133
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","In this report, we evaluated five types of subsidy reforms in animal agriculture.","text",134
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Welfare-conditional subsidies, where farmers are paid to adopt higher-welfare practices, appear to be an impactful way to help animals. Evidence from Switzerland and the EU suggests that these subsidies can bring concrete improvements in animal welfare, and possibly even reduce the production of animal products, as long as the subsidies are well-designed. We recommend that animal advocacy organisations consider campaigning for welfare-conditional subsidies, by which farmers are paid for adopting higher-welfare practices. This could involve increasing these subsidies in places where they already exist (Switzerland, the EU, and England) or establishing them in further countries.","text",135
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Abolishing or reducing subsidies for meat production also has the potential to be an effective campaign, but additional research is needed first. Initial studies suggest that abolishing these subsidies could decrease animal production, but a more sophisticated economic analysis is needed to confirm this before any campaigns take place. We recommend that such an analysis be conducted, as this study could unlock a new campaign option.","text",136
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","The final three options do not appear capable of helping animals: abolishing subsidies for feed crops, promoting subsidies for plant-based foods, and abolishing fisheries subsidies would either have no effect or possibly even harm animals. We recommend that animal advocacy organisations considering these campaigns choose a different campaign instead.","text",137

We would like to hear from any organisations that may have been considering working on these topics so that we may support you in prioritising your resources towards the most impactful opportunities.","text",138

"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","1. A similar policy involves placing taxes on meat. Our detailed research report on meat taxes isavailable here.","text",140
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","2. This raises the question of whether welfare-conditional subsidies (the first class of subsidies we considered in this report) should also be analysed in a sophisticated economic model before being chosen as a campaign. Although welfare-conditional subsidies could plausibly increase production, we do not think that this is a major risk. Welfare-conditional subsidies can increase the costs of production and/or decrease stocking densities, which are likely to decrease production (9).","text",141
"https://www.animalask.org/post/subsidies-which-reforms-can-help-animals","Nevertheless, it is possible for welfare-conditional subsidies to switch consumption from cows towards chickens and fish, which would cause overall harm to animals. This is an important risk to consider with welfare-conditional subsidies, and it is listed in Table 3.","text",142

We touch on all major farmed and wild-caught sectors in the country, before taking a deeper look at egg production and chicken meat production.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Looking at how animal production is clustered by state and county, we point out where there are opportunities for animal advocacy organisations to make the biggest impact on the lives of animals. We also provide an overview of the economic forces that determine how animals are farmed and killed, which can help us to understand whether any given campaign will deliver the impact that we intend.","text",14

"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","In contrast, fewer pigs (235 million) and cows (70 million) are killed each year.","text",24
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","The following graph shows the most numerous groups of animals killed by humans in the United States. You can use the drop-down menu to look at the numbers for specific states.","text",25
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","* Note that the numbers for egg-laying hens are expressed as ""alive at any one time"", not ""slaughtered per year"". Since hens live for around a year or a bit longer, the numbers would be similar.","text",26
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Delving deeper, we can see that specific industries tend to be concentrated in specific states. For the purposes of animal advocacy, it is perfectly reasonable to view the United States not as a single country, but as a network of 50 closely related countries that each has a distinct pattern of animal production.","text",27
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","This geographical clustering can empower animal advocacy organisations. When we think of animal exploitation in the United States, not many of us would immediately think of, say, Idaho. However, if you consider any given state, there's a decent chance that that state is responsible for a significant percent of one of the major animal industries. This offers advocacy organisations in pretty much any state the opportunity to have a disproportionately high impact. (More on this in the section ""Routes to change"", below.)","text",28
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","These trends are especially clear if we look at the following heatmap—you can pick a species and see how the production of that species is clustered across the country.","text",29

For a detailed analysis of the United States shrimp fishing industry, seeour report available here.","text",35
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","The most numerous animals tend to be dispersed more widely across the country—most states are involved in the production of chickens, eggs, and pigs. However, even for these more dispersed industries, there are some states that are home to a disproportionately high number of animals.","text",36
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Broiler chickens: Of the 9 billion broiler chickens produced each year in the United States, around 1.4 billion are produced in Georgia.","text",37

"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","There are a few reasons for this geographical clustering—geography and climate play a role. For example, shrimp farming requires warm water, which is found in the warm, southern state of Texas. On the other hand, sometimes the clustering originates from historical accident—while baitfish production in Arkansas benefits from the state's climate and wild fish populations, the industry's development can be traced back to a few specific business ventures launched in the 1940s by people who happened to live in Arkansas.","text",40
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","2. Industries can be very concentrated","text",41
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","We also observe the geographical clustering at the local level. In the following interactive graph, you can select a group of animals and see how the production of that animal is concentrated by counties.","text",42
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","For example, if we look at crustaceans, we can see that crustaceans are produced in many states across the country, but most of the production comes from just a few counties in Louisiana. The same is true for trout in Idaho— most of the trout farmed in the United States come from a handful of counties.","text",43
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Therefore, for many of these animal groups, there are just a few counties—and, in fact, just a few farms within those counties—that are responsible for the vast majority of the production.","text",44

"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","If we want to do as much good as we can for the lives of animals, it helps to have a grasp on the economic forces that determine how these animals are produced. Understanding these economic drivers is important to make sure that our advocacy efforts actually deliver the intended benefits for animals.","text",46
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","There are a few economic forces that are general, occurring across many types of animal production:","text",47
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Animals are produced in locations that are different from where their meat is consumed. For example, seafood is mostly consumed in dense cities (1).","text",48
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Consumers frequently substitute between different types of meat. This is especially important—and concerning—when consumers switch from beef to chicken (2–4). This can cause the ""small body problem"", which means that increasing the price of beef might actually cause more suffering than it solves (see an explanation of this problemhereand inour previous report).","text",49
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Food retail is very concentrated, and retailers have lots of power over prices (5).","text",50
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Livestock markets are well-integrated across the country, so changes in production volume and price in one part of the United States will trigger responses in other parts of the country (6).","text",51
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Fish and crustaceans markets are complicated. Different seafood products can be substitutes or complements, and this can change for different regions within the United States (7,8). It's not always clear how different products interact with each other on the consumer market, especially for wild-caught vs farmed products, and imported vs domestically produced products (9). This means we need to be cautious about campaigns that change the production volume or price of fish and crustacean products.","text",52
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","We have talked about farms and retailers, but it is also important to understand other businesses in the supply chain.","text",53
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Consider meat processing plants. In the United States, meat processing tends to be dominated by a handful of large plants. This is shown in the following interactive graph.","text",54
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","The dominance of a small number of large-scale processing plants leads to an interesting conclusion. Large-scale meat packing plants can achieve economies of scale, thereby decreasing the cost of meat for consumers (10). The Biden administration has pursued an antitrust policy, aiming to break up large meat packing companies into smaller companies. The stated intent of this policy is to reduce the market power of meat packing companies, which the Biden administration hopes will reduce the price of meat (11). However, meat packing companies, despite being large, don't actually have much market power—retailers do (10). Therefore, the Biden administration's policy of breaking up large meat packing companies might increase, not decrease, the price of meat. For animal advocacy organisations, this is a useful lesson in how understanding the economic dynamics relating to a particular policy ask can give us a better understanding of the policy's consequences.","text",55

"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Each year, the United States produces around 1.8 billion dozen eggs. These eggs are produced by a flock of laying hens that numbers about 370 million at any one time. Egg production is divided into two markets: the table egg market, which sells whole eggs (~70 percent), and the breaker market, which sells liquid and dried eggs to food production businesses (~30 percent) (12,13).","text",58
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Most eggs are produced by a small number of farms. The 370 million egg-laying hens in the United States are housed on 200,000 egg-producing farms. However, 280 million of these hens are concentrated on just 320 farms.","text",59
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","The egg industry is quite unique in that most of the eggs are produced and consumed within the United States (14). Each year, the United States imports roughly 26 million dozen eggs (1.4 percent of domestic production) and exports roughly 175 million dozen eggs (9.5 percent of domestic production).","text",60
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Therefore, most eggs farmed in the United States are eaten in the United States, and vice-versa. Trade is limited for two reasons: firstly, it is expensive and logistically complicated to transport eggs over long distances; and secondly, the United States has strict biosecurity rules that make it difficult for egg producers in other countries to sell to the United States. The most important trading partners are other countries in the Americas (e.g. Canada and Mexico), and specific countries in Asia (e.g. Japan and China).","text",61
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Another reason why the egg market is unique is that eggs have no close substitutes (14). If the price of eggs increases, then consumers might buy fewer eggs and are unlikely to simply switch to some other animal product. The fact that it is difficult to import eggs supports this conclusion - retailers do not have the option of simply purchasing more eggs from overseas.","text",62
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","This means that animal advocacy campaigns that increase the price of eggs can cause sustained, long-term reductions in the number of animals farmed for food. An economic analysis of California's hen welfare legislation, which applied to all eggs sold in California, showed that the legislation caused a noticeable decrease in the number of hens farmedacross the United States(15).","text",63

"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Turning to the production of chicken meat, we can see that the United States slaughters around 9 billion broiler chickens each year.","text",66
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","For chicken meat, international trade is somewhat more important. The United States exports the meat from around 1.6 billion broiler chickens each year (around 20 percent of domestic production), though the country only imports the meat from roughly 60 million broiler chickens each year (less than 1 percent of domestic production). This includes both meat and live chickens. Most of the chicken exports from the United States are destined for Canada, Mexico, China, and other countries in Asia and Central America. Notably, the United States competes with chicken producers in Argentina and Brazil for access to the Chinese market (16). This means that policies that affect chicken production in the United States can also have knock-on consequences on chickens farmed in these other countries.","text",67
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","The supply chain of chicken production in the United States is quite strange. The supply chain is dominated by very large companies called integrators (17,18). Integrators control multiple segments of the supply chain, supplying the birds and the feed to farmers and then processing the chickens during and after slaughter (19). The farmers, who sign contracts with the integrators, supply the land, facilities, and labor (17). These contracts can require the farmers to build barns to particular specifications, which often requires a large up-front investment from the farmer (20). Given this large investment and the fact that most areas only have a handful of integrators, it can be very difficult for many farmers to switch to a different integrator or leave chicken farming altogether (20,21). This means that the integrators have a very large amount of power, and the farmers very little (20).","text",68
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Of the 9 billion chickens slaughtered in the United States each year, 7 billion are produced and slaughtered under the auspices of just 10 companies (22). This is despite the fact that there are around 43,000 actual chicken farms in the country. The reason is two-fold—a small number of these farms produce most of the chickens, and each large integrator holds contracts with many farmers. Chicken companies have occasionally been involved in price-fixing, and the past 50 years have seen numerous lawsuits against this (21).","text",69

"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","The most promising route to change will depend on the specific ask that is best-suited to your organisation. We would love to work with you to investigate what this might be—to get in touch with us, see the top of this report.","text",73
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Generally speaking, there are many promising routes to change:","text",74
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","State-level legislative lobbying. The states have lots of power over the lives of animals, and most of the animal welfare reforms in the United States happen at the state level. It is possible to speak to legislators in a particular state (state representatives) and ask them to introduce particular regulations. These regulations can involve animals produced in that state or, as in the case of California's hen welfare legislation, animals produced in other states but sold in that state.","text",75
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Ballot initiatives. In many states and cities, it is possible to propose new regulations for direct vote—this has been a very successful strategy in securing hen welfare reforms in many states (15,23). Also, ballot initiatives and state-level legislative lobbying can support each other (23,24). For a detailed look at ballot initiatives, seethe report by Jason Schukraftandthe report by Aashish Khimasia.","text",76
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Corporate campaigns. It is possible to ask retailers and food businesses to only buy meat farmed to specific welfare standards. This has been an overwhelmingly successful strategy over the past few decades (25–27). However, since corporations are often hesitant to speak with more than one animal advocacy organisation at a time, there are now fewer opportunities for new organisations to conduct corporate campaigns.","text",77
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","University or caterer campaigns. It is possible to speak with the people who oversee university dining halls and catering businesses, and encourage them to switch some of their ingredients to plant-based foods (28).","text",78
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Environmental campaigns. The United States has many environmental regulations, but animal agriculture businesses do not always obey these regulations. Poorer environmental conditions are often observed around feedlots, which can harm people living in the area (29). It is possible to get the federal government to enforce regulations that are already on the books, thereby increasing the costs for some businesses. This strategy was used in a grassroots campaign in Iowa, utilising a ""not-in-my-backyard"" mentality among residents (30). On the other hand, this might just cause the production to shift to another location, rather than actually decrease.","text",79
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","Lobbying the Office and Management and Budget (OMB). The OMB, an office housed under the executive branch of the federal government, holds a large amount of power over how regulations are implemented and enforced in practice (31,32). If an organisation is aware of when the OMB is reviewing a particular regulation, it is usually straightforward to obtain a meeting with the OMB (31).","text",80
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-in-the-united-states-opportunities-for-impact","The one type of campaign that we donotfind promising is legislative lobbying at the federal level. Over the past 50 years, it has been very rare for Congress to pass new animal welfare laws—this is partially because of lobbying by agricultural interests and partially because Congress has been happy to leave animal welfare regulation to the states (33,34). More recently, due to the Congressional gridlock over the past decade or two, it has become difficult for Congress to pass new laws onanytopic. Of all the bills proposed in Congress, only ~1 percent actually get passed into law, and these tend to be the non-controversial, bipartisan bills (35). Due to the reluctance of Congress to touch animal welfare and the dysfunction of Congress in general, it would be more fruitful to focus on the other routes to change outlined above.","text",81

This applies to commercial fisheries, but it is especially true for recreational fisheries.

GPIs can be used to stimulate competition between countries or states, thereby placing pressure on policymakers to enact particular policy reforms.","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","The evidence shows that GPIs can cause policy change, at least in some cases.

Establishing this organisation is a relatively small investment for the movement (a couple of full-time staff members), and the GPIs would improve the probability of success for existing animal advocacy campaigns around the world. Given the potentially large benefits, making this small investment appears to be a great deal.","text",15

"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","1.1 What are global performance indicators (GPIs)?","text",29
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Global performance indicators (GPIs) are sets of rankings in which the performance of various countries (or states, supranational bodies, etc) in a given policy area are compared. GPIs are used, at least for our purposes, as a lobbying tool - by stimulating competition between countries or states, GPIs can place pressure on policymakers to enact particular policy reforms. GPIs also attract attention from the media and the public, making them one way to keep particular policy issues on the political agenda.","text",30
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","GPIs are also known as rankings, indicators, indices, composite indices, scorecards, or performance assessments. They exist in virtually all policy areas, from climate to corruption to human rights(1). It should be emphasised that we are here discussing GPIs as a political tool for placing pressure on policymakers, not as a scientific tool(1).","text",31

"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","World Animal Protection produces theAnimal Protection Index(API). The API provides a letter grade for 50 countries on the basis of their animal protection legislation. The API is frequently cited in the media, and we have heard from many animal advocacy organisations that the API has been a helpful tool during corporate relation campaigns. However, there will always be limits to what any one indicator can achieve. The main limitations specific to the API are:","text",33
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","The API has a very broad focus, meaning that it is not targeted towards specific policies. This might make policymakers less keen to adopt the lessons from the API.","text",34
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","The API includes all types of animals affected by humans. This may dilute the message and draw attention away from the most high-impact policy areas (e.g. farmed chicken and fish welfare).","text",35
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","The API operates at the level of countries. This is useful for countries where the national government has jurisdiction over animal welfare policy; however, in many countries, it is state or subnational governments that have most of the power over animal welfare. In countries where power over animal welfare is held by state governments, it may be more effective to produce indicators ranking the different states.","text",36
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","The API only measures 50 countries, meaning that it cannot be used by animal advocacy organisations in the rest of the world's countries.","text",37
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","The API is only updated every few years, rather than every year. This means that the API has fewer opportunities to gain media attention for animal welfare policy.","text",38
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","We are aware of four other GPIs in animal advocacy:","text",39
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","The Voiceless Animal Cruelty Indexbuilds on the Animal Protection Index by focusing more explicitly on farmed animals.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","For this approach, we consider establishing a new organisation whose sole purpose is to create GPIs for use in animal advocacy campaigns. This organisation would create new GPIs that rank jurisdictions against each other on the basis of the animal welfare policies that can do the most good for animals. For example, GPIs might focus on key welfare protections for farmed chickens, fish, or shrimp; alternatively, GPIs might focus on government policies that promote plant-based foods. The GPIs could also involve weighting criteria such that the GPI scores are a proxy for the total animal suffering caused (e.g. chicken and fish protection laws carry greater weight than cow protection laws).","text",45
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","These GPIs could be created at various levels, whether global, regional (e.g. all countries in the EU; or all African countries), or subnational (e.g. all states in Australia). The organisation would then circulate these rankings among local animal advocacy organisations to encourage the rankings' use as a tool in campaigns. A greater number of GPIs would mean that any given jurisdiction has a greater chance of scoring poorly by any one GPI, and therefore having a GPI that can be adopted by animal advocates for campaigns in that jurisdiction. Furthermore, GPIs could be specific to regions (e.g. western Europe; south-east Asia) - regional GPIs could increase the competitive spirit among regional rivals wanting to perform well, and regional GPIs could ensure that policy improvements are seen as more achievable by policymakers(5,6).","text",46
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","A GPI squad would be a hits-based approach. Many of the new GPIs might have minimal impact, but a handful could have enormous impact by triggering policy reform in a country.","text",47
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Campaigns rarely get cheaper than this. A GPI squad would basically require a couple of full-time staff members with an internet connection, plus some way to circulate complete GPIs to animal advocacy organisations in the relevant jurisdiction(s).","text",48

"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","The following diagram summarises the main ways that GPIs could cause policy change(5,7–12). There are also some risks that can interfere with policy change(8,13–15). Not all of the mechanisms visualised in the diagram are well-supported by the evidence. The evidence behind each of these various mechanisms are discussed further in the following section.","text",50

"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Yes, at least sometimes. The evidence suggests that GPIs can causally influence policy in a desired direction, at least occasionally and in some contexts. GPIs are similar to other forms of lobbying: definitely impactful in some cases, but difficult to measure(16).","text",53
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Some of the key publications that provide evidence in favour of GPIs are as follows:","text",54
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Western(15)finds a clever way to study the causal effects of GPIs, at least in some policy contexts. The author compares states' positions in GPIs to the speed with which those states ratify various treaties. Since treaties come with a clear ""adopted / not adopted"" signal, the author is able to provide counterfactual evidence about whether GPIs increase the probability of policy change. The author concludes that ""states in the mid-range of the indicator are faster to ratify than states that are not ranked, whereas the other categories are statistically insignificant. These findings imply that indicators matter for those in the middle, but not as much for those at the extremes.""","text",55
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","In a book edited by Malitoet al.(7), there are many cases of GPIs that have become very powerful (e.g. Human Development Index). There is even mention of ""a civil society organisation (Human Rights and Displacement Consultancy, CODHES) that does activism by producing indicators on internally displaced people and then confronts the national governments with the figures.""","text",56
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","The book edited by Kelley and Simmons(9)reviews the evidence of the effects of GPIs. The evidence is limited to a few policy domains, but there are some general insights. As the authors conclude: ""We have shown that GPIs can influence how an issue is discussed and understood and that some GPIs have ultimately altered the content or speed of reforms in the policy areas targeted [...] Sometimes specific laws and practices change as a result of GPIs."" The authors argue that GPIs ""can have very real effects on the targeted state through a status mechanism"". Policymakers ""know that their state is being ranked"", and that ""their performance will be splashed across the internet"", and so ""they experience social pressure to conform"". The authors point out that ""the media is particularly fond of reporting relative rankings"", so GPIs can help gain media attention for an issue. Finally, the authors emphasise the importance of the GPIs being produced by organisations that are perceived as having expertise.","text",57
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","One specific chapter in that book deals with the Aid Transparency Index, created by an NGO that was ""small, with nine staff members and a 2017 budget of less than £600,000"", ""housed in a modest one-room office above an Italian restaurant on London’s South Bank"", and had ""no direct material power"". Nevertheless, this NGO ""used its political independence and first-mover advantage to establish the gold standard for funding transparency""(9).","text",58
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Schleicher(17)reviews international GPIs with a focus on the education system. The author concludes that GPIs are a ""powerful instrument for policy reform"". GPIs can show what is possible; set policy targets and identify policy levers; establish trajectories for reform. GPIs transform a specialised/technical debate into a public debate. The author also gives examples in education where international GPIs have raised public awareness, engaged stakeholders in support of policy reform, and created political momentum - in many cases leading to concrete reforms. Notably, reform has typically occurred when countries score poorly, but reform has also occurred when the scores revealed specific problems that stakeholders were not already aware of (e.g. socioeconomic disparities in learning opportunities in Germany). The author does warn that ""policymakers tend to use them selectively, often in support of existing policies rather than as instruments to challenge them and explore alternatives.""","text",59
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Kelley(18)focuses on ""scorecard diplomacy"", where GPIs are embedded in traditional diplomacy. In other words, Kelley focuses on GPIs that are created by governments to place pressure on other governments. Kelley argues that GPIs have ""the power to shape the reputations of states."" The author provides evidence that policymakers do become upset when they receive scores that are worse than those of their peers. However, evidence that GPIs actually affect policy remains mixed, largely due to the confounded variables involved in this question.","text",60
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","There are also many contexts where GPIs have not appeared to cause any policy change. There are many null findings, and some GPIs never matter(9). To illustrate, Dominiqueet al.(19)provide a pessimistic view of GPIs, drawing on interviews with ICT policy experts in the US and Europe. The authors argue that ""policy-makers use international benchmarking [GPIs] strategically to advance their agendas"". Rather than allowing themselves to be manipulated by GPIs, policymakers ""select those that best suit their agenda and interests, citing results that are favourable and eschewing those that are unflattering."" Policymakers typically resist ""adopting the 'lessons' of international comparisons"" on the basis of ""the exceptional nature of their national circumstances"".","text",61

"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","There are four main mechanisms that have been identified as potential risks of GPIs:","text",63
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Backlash. When the people in a country feel shamed by outsiders, there may be public and political backlash: ""a strong, negative, public, and often angry societal reaction""(14). A negative emotional reaction can cause policymakers to becomemoreresistant to policy change, which might actually make policy change more difficult than it was in the first place. As Snyder(8)writes, there is a ""well-established risk that backlash of shaming can produce outcomes that are counterproductive for rights"". This is most relevant in jurisdictions that receive a negative score. This is probably a big risk, and there is strong evidence that this does occur(8,13,20–27).","text",64
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Trade-offs. Increasing the amount of attention for specific animal welfare reforms could take attention away from other important issues (within or outside of animal advocacy)(14). This is probably not a huge risk.","text",65
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Counteraction. When policymakers do indeed reform policy, they may strategically weaken policy in other areas at the same time(14). This can allow the policymaker to meet the specific demands placed on them while compensating in other areas (e.g. keeping the industry happy overall). This is probably not a huge risk.","text",66
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","The tortoise and the hare. If a jurisdiction performs well on a GPI, the policymakers in that jurisdiction may be incentivisednotto adopt any new animal welfare policies(15,28,29). However, there is not much evidence that this would actually decrease the probability that jurisdictions would adopt new policies, relative to the scenario where that jurisdiction was not ranked at all.","text",67
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Could these risks be a reasonnotto produce animal welfare GPIs? We think not—while these risks are certainly a reason to exercise caution, they are not a reason to forego GPIs altogether.","text",68
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Firstly, the evidence for some of these risks is weak. Strezhnevet al.(14)argue that the ""burden of proof [...] should be as rigorous as those for"" the idea that GPIs work in the first place. As Strezhnevet al.conclude: ""These claims may be plausible; all merit serious attention. But only a few researchers provide systematic evidence for such claims. Even fewer provide evidence that supports their causal arguments.""","text",69
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Secondly, there are ways that the creators of GPIs can reduce these risks. We think that the most significant risk is that of an emotional, public or political backlash—fortunately, there are characteristics that can be adopted when designing GPIs to reduce this risk. We list many of these characteristics below (see ""5. Good GPI design""). We agree with the conclusion of Strezhnevet al.(14), who write in the context of human rights: ""The risk of discouraging promotion of international human rights norms based on underidentified causal mechanisms is very serious indeed. Statistical science aside, we would argue that even if committing to and advocating international human rights sometimes cause some harm, this would not necessarily justify silence. Rather, it should prompt consideration of means to blunt the effects of counteraction.""","text",70

"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Local culture and norms are respected. Criticism is framed as an inconsistency between the target's identity (e.g. if a country values having a sustainable food system) and the poor policy performance. Alternatively, animal welfare is tied to the identity of a high-status out-group with which the target policymakers want to identify (e.g. countries that are ""internationally competitive"" for investments; ""environmentally responsible"" countries). Care is taken to reduce the ability of the target to invoke sovereignty and/or cultural traditions as justification for avoiding policy change.","text",92

"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Basically every researcher (including us) who has published on the topic of GPIs trips over themselves to emphasise how difficult it is to measure the policy impact of GPIs precisely. The context is critical. This presents a problem if we want to understand the cost-effectiveness of GPIs.","text",94
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","There are two ways of looking at this problem. Firstly, we could make a back-of-the-envelope calculation. For example, let's make some reasonable assumptions:","text",95
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","A GPI squad would need a couple of talented employees, together costing somewhere in the vicinity of 100,000 USD per year.","text",96
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Such a team could probably produce, say, a dozen sets of GPIs each year. We would not expect every GPI to have a policy impact. We might expect, conservatively, that one set of GPIs every few years causes a policy to be implemented where that policy would not have otherwise been implemented. It is also worth noting that each set of GPIs would target multiple countries, making this a very conservative estimate.","text",97
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Under these assumptions, it would cost the movement a few hundred thousand US dollars to buy a counterfactual policy.","text",98
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","These GPIs would typically be aimed at the most numerous groups of farmed animals in a particular region, like chickens, fish or shrimp. It is standard for an averaged-sized country to have somewhere in the vicinity of 10 million chickens alive at any one time.","text",99
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","If you divide the impact (millions of animal-years benefitted per year) by the costs (a few hundred thousand dollars), the number of animals helped per dollar does seem potentially high (e.g. comparable to corporate cage-free campaigns(35)). Also, after the first couple of years of operation, the GPI squad would have a much more informed view about these assumptions.","text",100
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Alternatively, rather than the quantitative back-of-the-envelope calculation, we could instead consider this qualitative argument:","text",101
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","We know two things with medium or high confidence. Firstly, GPIsdocause policy change, at least sometimes (see above section, ""Do GPIs cause policy change?""). Secondly, producing GPIs is dirt cheap. A GPI squad could consist of just a couple of full-time staff members and an internet connection, as long as there is a way to circulate the resulting GPIs to animal advocacy organisations in specific countries.","text",102
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Therefore, the cost-effectiveness probably hinges not on the cost of producing GPIs, but the relative balance of benefits versus risks.","text",103
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","We believe that the risks are probably pretty small, for reasons explained in the above section (""The risks of backfire"").","text",104
"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Therefore, a GPI squad is probably a worthwhile investment for the animal advocacy movement.","text",105

"https://www.animalask.org/post/global-performance-indicators-could-they-help-improve-animal-welfare-policy","Here, we have considered establishing a new organisation whose sole purpose is to create GPIs for use in animal advocacy campaigns. We believe that it is a worthwhile investment for the animal advocacy movement to launch such an organisation. It would be critical for this organisation to: focus on the most numerous farmed animal populations (e.g. chickens, fish and shrimp); design the GPIs to minimise the risk of backfire; and, after a couple of years, produce a better-informed cost-effectiveness estimate to test whether it is worthwhile for the organisation to continue operating.","text",107

"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Executive summary","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Although often seen as outsiders, activists represent values that can be found in all strata of society including the very institutions that are targeted by social movements. Individuals inside these institutions are often faced with uncomfortable moral dilemmas when their values as citizens conflict with their responsibilities at work. While some respond by repressing or compartmentalising these conflicts many will push against the problems in the system from the inside. There have been many instances of these insiders coordinating internal interest groups or cooperating with external organisations to help create change, including within animal advocacy.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","While these natural allies are a well regarded resource, more work could potentially be done to seed or cultivate allies within targeted institutions including corporations and governments. We examine the impact naturally occurring existing insiders have in various movements with the aim to investigate the potential impact of pursuing this as a route to activism.","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Broadly, we find that Insider activism is an inherently difficult phenomena to study and thus few attempts have been made to evaluate its impact empirically. Instead the majority of the existing evidence in favour of this approach is from theory and case studies. These broadly support employee and bureaucratic activism as viable approaches for achieving change. However, it’s still unclear how often attempts are successful. Even in cases where they are, the past success of the environmental or feminist movement may be more difficult to replicate for non-human animals, given the broadly lower levels of support.","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Given uncertain direct impact and the skill building available in such roles for more proven external advocacy tactics, this would still be a reasonable initial career path for activists to consider. In certain corporate roles, we also consider the value of the knowledge and information gathered. Although ultimately boosting the impact of these roles significantly, the information sharing approach comes with some risk. Whether this is worth it will depend on the legality of sharing this information in specific jurisdiction and the risk aversion of the individual.","text",16

"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","What is Employee Activism?","text",26
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Employee or insider activists refer to employees who try to challenge their hiring companies to defend social claims(2). The main outcomes of interest of employee activists are their impact on their own companies’ policies as well as industry wide effects when collaboration between employees of different companies occurs. Employee activists can either be people who are explicitly motivated to join companies to achieve some social goal or those who aim to achieve other social goals in a role they would acquire anyway. In the former case, the most widely used version of this tactic has been used by labour unions commonly referred to as ‘salting’ where a union representative will join an organisation with the intention of forming a union(3).","text",27
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Employees can either act individually or in a small group positioning themselves for influence within the organisation or can organise mass employee actions, including walkouts(4). In fact, a significant number of employees engage in some form. A survey of 1000 employed American adults found that 38% reported having spoken up to support or criticise their employers’ actions over an issue(5). However, only half of these (19%) were focused on broader social issues, rather than those in the workplace, and support or action taken for any particular cause will be significantly less. Still, the vast majority of employees believe employees are right to speak up about their employers whether they are in support of them (84%) or against (75%)(5).","text",28
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Being an employee of an organisation comes with some inherent benefits as well as drawbacks to other forms of activism. Insider activists have the highest levels of access to organisation decision makers and information about the company's inner workings. This allows them to use a variety of internal lobbying tactics, including the circulation of informational reports or use of victim testimonials, documentary films, and social media(2). Compared to outside actors, their improved understanding of the social networks in an organisation allows them to use these tactics more efficiently, by lobbying the right people and using the most sympathetic framing, and thereby improving their odds of successfully influencing the organisation (Kilduff & Tsai, 2003). A great example of this is the work of the Einstein Nurses United to identify the most respected and influential colleges within the nursing staff to target their outreach to individuals who could shift the rest of their colleagues to join a union (source), then utilising a mass strike to improve their collective bargaining power to negotiate union contracts.","text",29
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","However, being an insider is limiting in some ways as they are less likely to use some of the more disruptive tactics common for external pressure groups as they may risk being branded as troublemakers in ways that damage their careers(6). This is reflected in the typical tactics used by existing employee activists seen in table 1 which are more moderate tactics with less risk of personal costs. The vast majority of actions taken are discussions or social media comments rather than directly contacting or lobbying management or engaging in something more disruptive.","text",30

"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","For those that do use disruptive tactics, their knowledge of the internal company routines can be leveraged to target the most pivotal processes(2). However, existing employee activists don’t seem to be willing to take the larger risk of actively organising or putting themselves on the map as a ‘troublemaker’. This risk could be mitigated by external activist groups developing covert relationships with insiders (as discussed below in white collar undercover investigations) or by providing support for individuals who enter the organisation who already intend to take these risks, known as ‘salts’ in the labour union context.","text",33
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","The other risk of internal activism is that they can also be co-opted by organisations, particularly when internal groups rely on the organisation's resources(2).

This, and subsequent activism by employees, resulted in significant pressure on the company, and a subsequent investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission resulted in a 35 million settlement(18), and a loss of ⅓ of the company's market cap over the course of the scandal.

Therefore, we may expect these to increase the chance of success compared to a standard attempt of employee activism.","text",56
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","These examples also neglect the ‘tactful’ less visible tactics which employees are much more likely to use, such as expressing opinions in internal meetings(5).

Environmental employee resource groups have emerged in a variety of industries with a wide variety of activities. Unfortunately, most of the existing literature on the impact of these focuses on theory or concerns the impact on employee wellbeing or performance. There is not that much more beyond an understanding that the impact of these groups tends to be focused on raising internal awareness and advocacy(46), the ‘tactful’ advocacy tactics. Some companies, such as Macy’s, have included the environmental ERG in its sustainability initiative(46), but how often these groups achieve such involvement is unclear.","text",59
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Interestingly, companies themselves mostly consider their responses to employee activism as cooperative. Rietz et al (2021) conducted a survey from attendees at two different conferences as well as surveys of mid-seniority and senior leaders (n=392) inside a global organisation in the service sector(49). The total final sample included 7495 cross-sector and hierarchy leaders [email correspondence]. When asked to code their own organisations responses to employee activism, 8% were coded as non-existent suppressive, 14% as facadism (‘Let’s just say the right thing’), 18% as defensive engagement (must rather than want to engage), 47% as dialogic engagement (dialogue is proactively sought) and 13% as stimulating activism (activists given support). This is indicative that from a management perspective they view their typical response to employee activism as some form of either begrudging or proactive dialog with activists. Although Reitz et al notes that what senior management ‘perceive as engagement may not be perceived as such by more junior employees or those taking a stand on activist issues’(49).","text",60

"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","The large number of cases of successful employee activism across cause areas is a good signal for the promise of the approach. However, a major concern with the generalisability with historic examples of employee activism is the level of support from employees. Amongst the general population there is widespread support for improving the conditions and protections of non-human animals(50–52). However, some of the seemingly most successful tactics, from widely publicised cases, involve a wide number of employees and more demanding tactics. So, even though most people support improvements to animal welfare, they need to be willing to take action and, potentially, personally costly action to engage in many of the tactics involved.","text",62
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","A survey of the general UK population by Social Change Lab found 2.3% of the population reported attending ‘an event, protest or demonstration related to animal welfare or rights for animals’, 18.7% had ‘Shared content on social media about animal welfare’ and 45% had ‘Talked to your friends and family about animal welfare issues’ (Social Change Lab, forthcoming). To compare this to support for climate change, where activists have had success using employee activism in some contexts, in another survey in the UK, 11% of respondents indicated they were slightly (5.8%), quite (3%) or very likely (2.3%) to ‘Go to a legal protest’. With many more slightly (19.2%), quite (20.9%) or very likely (20.7%) to ‘Talk with others (e.g. spouse, partner, parent(s), children, friends) about environmental issues’ (Social Change Lab, forthcoming),which, although prospective rather than respective, indicates 3-4 times as many people are willing to protest for climate change than animal welfare or rights.","text",63

"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Many instances of employee activism have been successful at moderate turnouts, usually a few percent of the workforce. So, if taken at face value, the rate of previous attendance to animal advocacy demonstrations and volunteering for animal groups suggests that enough employees would be willing to participate in a walkout for animal welfare issues. However, this is self-reported attendance of a much wider category of events or demonstrations. Even if only requiring a small fraction of employees, the risk of being fired is a large ask to make of activists, particularly those who are not privileged enough to have a sufficient safety net to potentially risk being fired. Still, it seems plausible that there would be enough internal support for moderate tactics and possibly, in some cases, for the more aggressive tactics.","text",66
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Which part of the companies likely to be targeted would work best?","text",67
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","For these tactics to be successful there needs to be sufficient support within the firms most likely to be targeted through this approach, which in the animal advocacy context are large restaurants or fast food chains and supermarkets. This support could come from a few different areas within the company with employees in different areas having access to different tactics.","text",68
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","The main split within each company is between the vast majority who work in each company's thousands of retail stores and those in their corporate offices. For two of the largest supermarket chains by employment, Walmart and Tesco, the head office accounts for only a few percent of employees with Walmart employing approximately 1.6 million associates in the US (2.1 million worldwide)(55)and only around 14,000 of these in the company's US corporate headquarters(56), 0.9% of the US workforce. Whereas Tesco has more than 330,000 colleagues(57)with about 5,000 working in their corporate headquarters(58), 1.5% of employees.  We can see that the vast majority of employees in retailers work within their physical locations. Successful organising at this level would allow the use of strong pressure tactics such as a mass walkout, causing store closures. However, doing so would require coordination between a vast number of individuals across thousands of locations. Many of those working in stores are mostly paid at or close to the respective minimum wages in their countries(59,60). An internal report from one supermarket in the US found 1 in 5 of its associates received government assistance and most considered to be living in poverty(61). In addition, the medium turnover rate is usually around 50% so most employees are not around for very long(62,63). Those engaging in activism here would likely be least financially able to risk their job and most at risk of replacement. They also lack direct access to important decision makers or the ability to gain direct influence of supply decisions. So although there is widespread evidence of concern for animal welfare across many different demographics, those in front line roles have a greatly reduced ability to act on these values. It may instead be better to use petitions from staff to campaign for change.","text",69
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","The company headquarters and corporate office employees employ fewer people but the roles are much better compensated and can give employees direct access to key decision makers.  Employees working in these roles tend to be more educated and more able to risk being fired. Existing survey data suggests that those with similar demographics are more likely to take larger actions as their financial status and access to options can shield them from any ramifications(53). In the US, 21% of those with a bachelor’s degree or higher had ‘boycotted a store or product or had volunteered for an animal group [in the past year]’ and a further 50% were ‘allies’, those who had ‘taken actions out of concern for animals in the past year, such as: adopting an animal from a shelter, buying meat or dairy products labelled humane, or signing a petition for an animal cause’ and ‘who said they support anti-cruelty investigations or filing lawsuits to protect animals’(53). These individuals are also much more concentrated geographically with most of the relevant employees working in the same office or location making it much easier to organise.","text",70
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Importantly, some positions within the corporate head office give employees access to or direct ownership of the decision behind product procurement. Examples of these roles include: Food Operations including buying, supply chain management and Food Innovation and Agriculture. Outside of these direct roles other departments can have influence over and knowledge of purchasing decisions, including the marketing and corporate social responsibility teams. This seems like the most promising area of the company to target for ease of organisation, ability of employees to engage in activism, and improved access to other internal lobbying channels. Access is more limited than for retail roles as these jobs either require some university education or specific backgrounds; if those requirements are met then they can be applied to directly or accessed by graduate schemes for their relevant areas.","text",71
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Overall, surveys tend to show widespread concern for animal welfare and a significant number of people willing to take some action. However, the tactics used by employee activists vary dramatically in demandingness from speaking up in meetings to riskier actions, such as signed public statements or walkouts. At this time, it seems unlikely to be tractable in physical retail stores or restaurants but quite plausible in companies’ corporate offices.","text",72
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","What if employees won’t organise on their own, evidence from Union ‘Salting’","text",73
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","As outlined earlier, union ‘Salting’ is when individuals join an organisation with the intention of forming a union(3)and is the most widely documented case of corporate entryism. This has been used most widely in roles that are easy to enter, such as the services industry. In the case of union salting, the aim is to initially represent oneself as an ideal employee then network with existing employees gaining an understanding of the social network, any grievances employees may have and, importantly, potential organisers or allies. The external union then leverages this understanding to develop relationships with these potential allies and spur them to action. Although the aims of these unions do not generalise to animal advocacy, the general approach is the same and will be indicative of what advocates can expect, particularly as this approach can be employed in companies that don’t have any employees who would otherwise act first to take the lead on organising. There are a few case studies of prominent successful ‘salts’ most notably in Amazon and Starbucks:","text",74
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","In 2021, Justine Medina applied to JFK8 Amazon facility in Staten Island as a salt and began working in September that year. By April 01, 2022, they had successfully worked alongside several other organisers to win the vote from workers in favour of forming a union(64).","text",75
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Jaz Brisack, a Rhodes Scholar, became a barista at a Starbucks in Buffalo, New York, which they successfully helped organise. After the successful vote, another 238 U.S. Starbucks stores also voted to unionise(65)","text",76

"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Even though there are prominent examples of successful salts in a variety of contexts, there are a few problems with the existing evidence of the efficacy of salts for our context. First is the base rate of success, as although there are certainly case studies of successful salts, given the covert nature of the practice there is not much evidence on the success rate of salts. Either as a whole or pre-vetted, well supported salts as would likely be used in the animal advocacy context. This makes the existing evidence prettyweak.Inaddition to this, although Union salting does employ a very similar theory of change to activist salting, the ask involved is aiming to better the conditions of workers who then have a self-interested incentive to organise. Still, this is not without risk to the first people to begin organising and in these cases the personal risk reward calculation may not make sense on purely self-interested grounds. Given the lower rate (about half) of employee activism for social issues outside of the workforce(5), we should expect salting for other social causes to have a lower rate of success.","text",78
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Resources needed","text",79
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","The costs involved in this approach depend on whether people join organisations with the intent of organising or outside actors attempting to gain connections with existing employees. Salts working for unions have received compensation for their applications, for the time spent organising in addition to their paid work or subsiding lower wage jobs for salts who could have earned significantly more elsewhere(67). Many organisers have subsequently decided to turn down the money and these were in roles with significantly worse salaries compared to the corporate roles that would be targeted for employee organising. The main costs involved would thus be the counterfactuals of the individuals who choose this as a potential career route, which would need to be assessed on an individual basis.","text",80
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","The additional time cost of external organising could vary widely depending on the level of investment. This could vary from a small investment in managing and highlighting potential allies that are highlighted through other activities conducted for a campaign and then subsequently developing relationships with these individuals, to heavy investment in scoping and investigation into all staff members’ support for the cause and social capital within the company with an aim to develop relationships with internal influencers or other less visible allies that would not otherwise have been encountered.","text",81

"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","An important consideration for taking this approach is the legal risk to the individual and potentially sponsoring organisation.As the legality of this approach and potential penalties will vary by jurisdiction this section should not be taken as legal advice. If you or someone you know is considering organising other employees or collaborating with external activists they should seek local specialised legal advice before taking action.The considerations below only cover the risk involved in broad strokes.","text",83
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","The first act taken with this form of activism is applying for a job with the intent to organise or take action when in the role. There is legal precedent, in the US, for the protection of Union organisers(68)(69), which ultimately ruled that the union and the employer can pay a ""salt"" at the same time and that the employer could not treat salts differently than non-union employees during the hiring and employment processes(68). Although generalising, outside of the union context is perilous given the stronger protections afforded to unions. This case also involves an external organisation paying the employee to salt, something that may not be necessary in all cases and makes the case much more solid against the employee. The important factors are to present no false information on the application as this can leave you open for legal action(70,71).","text",84
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Still, there are individuals who take a wide range of roles in all industries with the intent of taking pro-social action, such as many environmentalists who work in the oil and gas industry(72). Employee groups already have widespread precedent for LGBTQ(44), Womens’(45)and environmental resources’ groups(46)with no action taken against individuals based on membership of these groups. In some instances, these companies even encourage these sorts of individuals to apply. For the mildest forms of activism which are most common, such as talking with other colleagues about your concerns, contacting management or HR or expressing opinions in company meetings, there are few risks involved.","text",85
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","The next category of action activists may take are more public facing actions including social media campaigns, petitions and protests such as walkout. Companies could attempt to sue employees or even ex-employees for social media campaigns and comments if the information is defamatory, which involves statements that damage a company's reputation that are “a false statement purporting to be fact”(73). For some cases, this could be a large financial risk. If a company loses a contract based on the comments, damages could exceed lifetime earnings for those with the case brought against them. Even when any statements made are true, this still would not protect the employee from being fired by the company unless they were statements of illegal behaviour at your workplace(74,75). So, for example, writing about the purchases of caged eggs or lack of progress on commitments would not concern illegal activity so would not protect you from being fired. The lawfulness of a walkout and public protest based on legal behaviour depends on the purpose, timing, and the conduct of the strikers(76). Here, unfortunately, the strike must generally concern a work-related issue to be protected under the law. Making protests taken for issues affecting those outside of the workplace unprotected and putting those involved at risk of being fired(77,78). Although, as long as the statements made are true and no damage or other illegal activity takes place during the walkout, there should be no legal liability for attending protests either.","text",86

"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Although there have been some well-publicised instances of successful employee activism, the existing evidence to support the overall efficacy of the approach in the context of animal advocacy is limited. Much of the research and evidence discussed here is focused on analogous causes or the use of tactics to gain concessions in other areas. So, although the approach has had some success for other causes, there is good reason to question the external validity of these cases. Particularly as the existing support for animal welfare/rights is lower than for the most prominent cases of environmentalism or for workplace issues such as discrimination or working conditions. Even within these areas, the obscure nature of most employee activism tactics makes it difficult to study.","text",100
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Still, this approach could be promising and warrants further exploration. Broadly then, employee activism seems securely legal as long as you do your job well which is likely to be beneficial to your activism anyway. However, some actions that you may take won’t be protected legally, so you can be fired. It could be a good route for skill building for advocates who want to eventually work for external advocacy groups in corporate relations. An understanding of a company's inner workings and the workload involved in relevant roles would be beneficial even if attempts to influence the organisation from the inside are unsuccessful. The primary benefit at this time would thus be information value about the impact of the approach and career capital.","text",101

"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Theoretical value of Information Asymmetry","text",138
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Information asymmetry refers to a situation where one party possesses more or superior information compared to another party. Corporate undercover investigations have the potential to reduce the information asymmetry for campaigners by providing them with valuable insights into the operations and priorities of companies. At present, we have some understanding of the companies’ operations and thinking but companies generally have more information then campaigners do. This is particularly important in negotiations, which corporate campaigners are a form of, where a party with superior information can leverage this advantage to secure more favourable terms, concessions, or agreements. This can be seen   in a few ways:","text",139
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Information Advantage: When one party has a deeper understanding of the relevant facts, market conditions and potential outcomes. They can make more informed decisions, assess risks accurately, and devise effective negotiation strategies by exploiting gaps in the other party's knowledge.","text",140
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Control of Disclosure: The party with more information can control what is disclosed and when. This allows the party with more information to employ tactics such as bluffing, misrepresentation, or strategic silence to exploit the lack of information on the other side. They can selectively reveal or withhold information to shape the negotiation process and influence the perceptions of the other party. This can be used, for example, to highlight difficulties with implementation that campaigners may not have been aware of to create the perception that the campaign is a bigger ask than it actually is.","text",141
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","However, some of these risks and benefits of having more information than your competitor in a negotiation can be mitigated through typically due diligence before a campaign is launched. Research into the potential components of an ask, their implementation and market analysis can mitigate some of the risk of informational asymmetry. Some of the aspects outlined in the “What information would be available in these roles?” could potentially be addressed through sufficient due diligence. As can be seen from the coding in that section, the information that would be hardest to acquire through traditional research is sentiment of individual companies to an ask and the groups targeting them.","text",142
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Simplistic Model of the Theoretical Value","text",143
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","To make these considerations more concrete and to gain a lower bound figure on the value resolving these problems needs to be acquired, I estimate the net counterfactual value per person per year would acquire in one of these roles. You can find theguesstimate model here.","text",144
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","This looks at the historic spending on cage free campaigns before 2019 which was between $36m-$84m spent across ~10 countries(81)and assuming an additional one or  two pro-animal employees take jobs at the top three to five of grocery stores in the US, France, UK, Brazil, Spain, Italy, Germany, Mexico, Poland, and Denmark, or around 50 activists in total (an average of five per country).","text",145
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Although the funding required to support this would be pretty minimal, possibly as much as one or two full-time equivalent across all of these countries, the main cost comes from the counterfactual use of those employed at the firms. These people may have otherwise been hired at animal advocacy organisations immediately or have skilled up in the future. Therefore, some fraction of the time these archivists spend working at these organisations would pull counterfactual from animal advocacy groups or other good causes they may have supported. However, this is partially compensated for by skills and knowledge development in the roles for those who would otherwise not have got jobs in the field immediately. So, the overall cost of this approach is pretty low even if employed across multiple countries.","text",146
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","In the above model, the value created by each person in such a role would be $31,000 dollars per year (5 to 130k), which, if the counterfactuals are similar skill building roles or moderate earning to give, this would be an improvement. However, about a third of the value of this estimate comes from the information acquired to inform Ask formation every 7 to 13 years, some of which could be acquired through sufficient due diligence. The other two thirds depend on the highly uncertain input for the speed up effect of ongoing knowledge of sentiment. I estimated the speed up effect as reasonably small (1 to 25% lognormally distributed) with the high end being the possibly much larger effect if a strong employee activism type event catalysed by the same staff occurred, and, on the very low end of the estimate if the information does not provide as much value as theorised here.","text",147

"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Another institution that may benefit from employee activism is the government which can include national departments, particularly those involved in agriculture, fisheries, or directly in animal husbandry or welfare. Sometimes referred to as institutional activism(82,83)or bureaucratic activism(84), Abers describes institutional activism as people taking “jobs in government bureaucracies with the purpose of advancing the political agendas or projects proposed by social movements”(82). This has been largely focused on government on the national level, but local government activities can also be affected by concerned citizens taking on relevant roles.","text",161
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","How successful is Government Employee Activism","text",162
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","There is very little empirical evidence examining how government employee activism affects policy outcomes. The only instance examining cross jurisdiction outcomes is Hysing et al (2011) who examined the effect of insider environmental activists, identified by their commitment to environmental values, on the environmental performance of 279 of the 290 municipalities in Sweden(85). They identified green inside activists that operated within 67 municipalities in Sweden (23%). These insider activists had more positive assessments of local environmental governing than other environmental officials. As well as external measures of performance, such as the annual evaluation of the environment by the magazine Miljoaktuellt (Environment News) and a survey from the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation. They found that performance on these metrics increased by between 10.4%, 14% and 9.8% of the scales respectively(85)( or a 22%, 42%, 28% increase). While this is a useful contribution, the outcome measures are less direct and the focus is on local government in Sweden, which may give officials more decision making power than other areas.","text",163
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Case Studies of Government Employee Activism","text",164
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Outside of more rigorous assessments there have been case studies of government officials influencing policy in a variety of settings. In Brazil, Abers documents the evolution of the Green Grants program(84). They examined how, during the Workers' Party era (2003), many social movement actors joined the government; many later left the government in 2007. Still, subsequent civil servants continued the environmentalist cause, even when this required contesting the priorities of superiors. Given the methodology, the author notes it is difficult to establish precisely how much impact these insider activists had. However, follow up interviews in 2016 found that most of the initiatives they had designed were still a decade later.","text",165
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","This form of insider activism has also been used to document the feminist movement in a variety of contexts. In Canadian foreign policy, both senior and mid-level, feminist government employees have both promoted feminist policies and resisted or circumvented directives that limit or marginalised gender equality programming(86). While in Australia, the labour party program of reforms in the 1970s saw the inclusion of feminists, some of whom had previous experiences as activists. Pettinicchio highlights that these “femocrats” were heavily involved in policy design and reform across many departments, establishing networking within the bureaucracy(83). Again in Brazil, the 'Stork Network’ program was championed by an internal women’s health group which included mostly temporary employees with long histories of civil society activism(87)","text",166

"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Government bureaucrats are responsible for various administrative functions, the implementation of government policy, and development activities within their remit. These positions give activists access to public resources including information, finances, legitimacy, political contacts and to key policy processes and venues(85).","text",171
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","From the limited evidence available, it appears that value-aligned individuals can improve government policies within these roles. In favourable political situations, they can act to accelerate the implementation of good policies and work to shape the initial stages of the policy formation process. When governments change to those less aligned with the social movement, insider activists can resist the implementation of poor policies and occasionally use discretion in the implementation of ambiguous laws(88).","text",172
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","It is generally agreed upon that government bureaucrats influence public policy in the literature but the degree and frequency that this occurs is less well defined. The bulk of the existing research in these areas remains largely theoretical or case study based as with corporate insider activism in part because the activities involved occur within a private institution.","text",173
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Conclusion","text",174
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Insider activism is an inherently difficult phenomena to study and so few attempts have been made to evaluate its impact empirically. Instead the majority of the existing evidence in favour of this approach is from theory and case studies. These broadly support employee and bureaucratic activism as viable approaches for achieving change. However, it’s still unclear how often attempts are successful. Even in cases where they are - whether the past success of the environmental or feminist movement can be replicated for non-human animals is less clear given the broadly lower levels of support. Still, given uncertain direct impact and the skill building available in such roles for more proven external advocacy tactics, this would still be a reasonable initial career path for activists to consider.","text",175
"https://www.animalask.org/post/insider-activism","Outside of the direct routes for influence in these roles, the information available to certain corporate employees could be very valuable to external advocacy groups. Ultimately though, the information sharing approach while boosting the impact of these roles significantly comes with some risk. Whether this is worth it will depend on the legality of sharing this information in specific jurisdiction and the risk aversion of the individual.","text",176

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Key Points","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Animal parties are minor (niche) political parties with a single-issue focus on animals.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Animal parties can win seats in elections that use proportional representation. The most important strategic decision is to choose to contest elections where seats can be won with just a couple of percent of the vote. Animal parties have won seats in five countries (Australia, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Portugal).","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","When an animal party wins even one seat or a couple of seats, the impact for animals is typically positive and moderate. Occasionally, the impact can be enormous.","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","We recommend a handful of countries where we think small grants are likely to help animal parties win at least one seat. Providing initial funding for animal parties in these countries appears to be low-hanging fruit, and this small level of funding is likely to have a disproportionately high level of impact.","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Executive Summary","text",17
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","This approach involves establishing political parties with an explicit, and typically single-issue, focus on animal advocacy. These parties are minor (niche) parties. Animal parties can usually only win seats in elections that use proportional representation.","text",18
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","There are a few ways that animal parties can influence the lives of animals. The main way is by winning seats in legislatures and exercising power over legislation, government budgets, and so on. Animal parties can also influence policy in ways that do not necessarily require winning elections, such as obtaining policy concessions from other parties and setting the political agenda.","text",19
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Currently, animal parties have won seats in national and sub-national legislatures in five countries (Australia, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal). The track record of the animal parties in these countries shows that the impact is positive and moderate, though massive wins do happen sometimes. The impact falls into four main categories:","text",20
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Large policy wins, which seem rare but enormous (i.e., hits-based). These crop up on the rare occasions when the policy agenda and the specific makeup of the legislature provide a window for an animal party to secure large policy concessions from other parties. Examples include major policy changes (e.g. inclusion of fish in animal welfare laws or bans on widespread farming practices like beak trimming) or allocating millions of dollars for animal welfare in national budgets.","text",21
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Small policy wins, which seem quite common. Examples include policies that benefit small numbers of animals (e.g. bans on particular types of hunting, restrictions on animal experimentation).","text",22
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Shifting the political agenda and influencing the policies of other parties. This effect is notoriously difficult to measure, though it does seem to be positive and meaningful.","text",23
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Capitalising on the non-legislative benefits of being an MP. This can include joining parliamentary committees, using the public stature of an MP to gain media attention for animal issues, and using allocated budgets to conduct campaigns outside of parliament.","text",24
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","In elections, animal parties typically attract just a few percent of the vote (e.g. 0 - 3%). There are numerous jurisdictions around the world where parties can win seats with modest votes like this. We believe that these jurisdictions are low-hanging fruit. Forming parties and contesting elections in these jurisdictions would result in animals gaining representation in a number of additional legislatures. There is less evidence that animal parties can readily expand their vote through advertising - instead, it appears that animal parties are mainly supported by a small core of passionate voters, and that the vote will therefore remain somewhat steady at around 0 - 3% over time. So, we think that the most important consideration is not necessarily advertising or crafting a perfect campaign strategy, but ratherpicking the right elections to contest, i.e. running in elections where parties can win seats with just a couple of percent of the vote.","text",25
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","We ask whether there are any legislatures around the world where a) animal parties are not currently contesting elections, and b) an animal party would probably win at least one seat if such a party were formed and contested an election. In some of these jurisdictions, an animal party does exist but it is not contesting all available elections.","text",26
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","We think that the most promising jurisdictions, along with the number of seats we would expect to win, are as follows:","text",27

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","The next step would be to reach out to local animal advocacy communities (or animal parties, where applicable) in the countries listed above. We have not considered the local contexts of these countries when forecasting the expected number of seats, so our forecasts may need to be adjusted up or down based on local considerations.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","The costs to funders would be relatively small. These new parties may need financial support to contest the first election in each country. Most of this cost would pay for advertising, an online presence, and enabling a small team to work full-time on an election campaign in the few weeks immediately before the election. We suspect that around ~$30,000 USD would be the upper limit on how much a party would need for the first election. After the first election, the party would usually not require ongoing support from foundations - any elected legislators would receive a salary, the party may be eligible for government funding, and the party may build a base of paying members.","text",43
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","We also conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to illustrate the impacts that animal parties can have. Basically, the lessons from this analysis are that: costs are low; most elected animal parties can successfully pass small policies (benefiting thousands of wild or companion animals); and some elected animal parties can successfully pass enormous policies (benefiting millions of farmed animals). This approach is difficult to scale as it is limited by the availability of legislatures where seats can be won with just a few percent of the vote. However, given the low costs, the positive impact, and the opportunity for occasional big wins, we think that helping animal parties contest additional elections would be a great part of the movement's portfolio.","text",44

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","This approach involves establishing political parties with an explicit, and typically single-issue, focus on animal advocacy. These parties are almost always minor parties (the only exceptions being when parties join larger alliances, as in France).","text",78
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Animal parties can realise impact by pursuing three main strategies. Of course, these strategies can support each other, and each strategy benefits from obtaining votes.","text",79
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Winning seats. A few parties have won seats at the national or regional/state levels (see table below). There have also been some successes at the supranational level (European Union) and the local level. When an animal party wins seats, it can influence legislation, which can be a major opportunity for policy influence. It is typically unrealistic for minor parties to implement their own legislation. Parliamentarians can also use their status to gain attention for issues, such as in the media or by building coalitions with other parliamentarians from other parties(1).","text",80
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Policy concessions. For example, we illustrated in a previous article how the animal party in Australia can secure pro-animal policies from the government simply by running in elections(2). The election summarised in that article used preferential voting, in which a voter casts their vote by ranking the available candidates. This allowed the animal party to obtain policy concessions from one of the two major parties in exchange for having the animal party's voters rank that party above the competing major party when voting.","text",81
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Agenda-setting. For example, the animal party in the Netherlands ""did not seek to implement its own animal welfare proposals directly, but rather it sought to make established parties work harder on animal issues through their participation in elections and in parliament""(3). Influencing the agenda may be easiest for parties that can win seats, though parties can achieve some influence over the agenda simply by being very active during elections(2).","text",82
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Animal parties are unlikely to represent a pathway to victory for the animal advocacy movement on their own. The reason is that the success of animal parties is usually tied to public opinion. Nevertheless, animal parties can have an impact well beyond their level of formal electoral success, so animal parties could form one part of a portfolio of strategies used by the movement.","text",83

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","The following diagram summarises the mechanisms by which animal parties contesting legislative elections can help animals. The main mechanism is, of course, winning one seat or a handful of seats and then using that position inside the legislature to pass animal welfare laws and to secure pro-animal concessions in other legislator's proposed laws. However, as the diagram shows, this is one mechanism among many. Many of these mechanisms are discussed in detail later in the report (see sections ""8. Track Record of Existing Parties"" and ""10. Academic Literature"").","text",85

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Since our analysis is focused on winning just one seat or a handful of seats in a legislature, this raises the question of how much policy influence a party can exert in a large legislature by holding just a handful of seats. On this topic, one cannot generalise - the answer will vary wildly across jurisdictions, and even in the same jurisdiction across terms of parliament.","text",91
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","On one extreme, there are cases where a single seat gives a minor party the power to make or break governments. We can illustrate using an example from outside animal politics. The Australian 2010 federal election resulted in two MPs striking the jackpot - the election resulted in a hung parliament, where the balance of power during the formation of government was ultimately held by just two independent MPs. These MPs found themselves in a position where they were being courted by the two major parties (which were hoping to form government) with major policy initiatives, high-value development projects in the MPs' districts, and even an offer of a Ministerial position(4,5). If an animal party MP found themselves in this position, the policy impact for animals could be transformative. On the other extreme, there are cases where a government commands a majority of seats, meaning that a single seat held by a minor party would be of little relevance.","text",92
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Most of the time, minor parties that win a seat in a legislature would find themselves somewhere in between those extremes. Furthermore, whether an elected animal party finds itself in a powerful legislative position or not, merely holding membership in a legislature can also allow a party to exert policy influence through other means. One such means is sitting on parliamentary committees. For example, a Member of Parliament from the Animal Justice Party in New South Wales, Australia was the chair of the Select Committee on Animal Cruelty Laws (and a member of many other committees). Another way to exert policy influence is by capitalising on the public stature, staff budgets, and travel rights that come with being an MP. People elected to legislatures can use the profile and resources associated with this position to draw attention to their issues. This was exploited by one early legislator from the Australian Greens, who ""for most of her time in parliament concentrated on the outside world"", attracting substantial media attention to her chosen issues(1). It is easy to see how a legislator from an animal party could substantially magnify the attention given to, say, undercover investigations on factory farms.","text",93

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","In this report, we are mainly interested in how parties influence policy by winning seats in legislatures or otherwise influencing legislative elections). Our current view is that animal parties can successfully win seats in proportional systems, but this would be extremely difficult in majoritarian systems. Animal parties can certainly have meaningful policy influence without winning seats, but they would need to explore other avenues for achieving impact.","text",95
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","3.1 We focus on proportional representation","text",96
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","We distinguish between two broad classes of election systems.","text",97
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Majoritarian systems. These are also called ""winner-takes-all"" systems because the most popular major parties (typically two major parties) win almost all of the available seats. The percentage of seats won by the major parties typically exceeds their combined percentage of the vote. An example of a majoritarian system is First-Past-the-Post as used in the United States Congress. Importantly, we consider some preferential voting systems to be majoritarian, an example of which is the Instant-Runoff Vote used for the lower house in the Australian Parliament.","text",98
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Proportional systems. These systems distribute seats to parties roughly in proportion to the share of the votes that the parties received - a party receiving 10% of the vote can expect to receive about 10% of the available seats. There are a few different mathematical formulae used to distribute the seats. Some jurisdictions have a minimum threshold that parties must surpass before receiving any seats (e.g. 5% of the vote).","text",99
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","There is also a third type of electoral system - theni-nisystem. This is just a category that captures all miscellaneous systems that aren't accurately described as majoritarian or proportional. This term is an abbreviation of the French phrase ""ni l'un ni l'autre"", meaning ""neither one nor the other""(6). We do note that, for the purposes of this report, we treat some ni-ni systems as proportional systems (e.g. mixed electoral systems in which voters ""cast separate votes for two sets of seats allocated by different systems, most commonly single-member plurality and proportional representation""; and proportional with majoritarian incentives, in which ""other electoral rules give incentives to support larger parties""(6)).","text",100
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Animal parties are minor parties. How does the election system influence the success or failure of minor parties?","text",101
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","When it comes to majoritarian systems, the conventional wisdom is captured by Duverger's law. This law states that majoritarian systems naturally lead to stable, two-party systems in which minor parties are doomed to exclusion from the legislature(7). The mechanism typically offered to explain this pattern is that a voter does not want to ""waste"" their vote by voting for a party that is unlikely to win a seat in that voter's electorate - this leads to voters almost always voting for one or two major parties, which in turn makes minor parties seem like even less viable options(8). In contrast, Duverger concluded that proportional systems naturally lead to multi-party systems, in which minor parties often win seats(7).","text",102
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","While Duverger's law does hold in many jurisdictions, there are also exceptions. Voters do not always vote in the purely strategic way that is suggested above - evidence from elections shows that voters, even in majoritarian systems, simply vote for the candidate they like the best(8,9).","text",103
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Academic research has identified some important circumstances in which minor parties can successfully win seats in majoritarian systems:","text",104
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Regionalist parties. Historically, minor parties in majoritarian systems have been most successful when they focus on issues specific to one region, ethnicity or demographic, enabling a minor party to receive high support in a small locality(6,9,10). This effect is magnified in federalist countries: the existence of provincial legislatures ""provides a power base for minor parties that can then be used as a platform for national office""(11).","text",105
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Anti-establishment parties. When voters feel discontent with established parties and frustration at the lack of options, they often express this dissatisfaction by voting for particularly radical minor parties. However, for minor parties to pursue this strategy, they must have policies sufficiently radical that they cannot be co-opted by major parties (e.g. extreme right-wing populism). This means that minor parties may have success where they can a) establish an ideology that is sufficiently distinct and radical to avoid being co-opted, and b) run on an anti-establishment platform to capture dissent in the population(8).","text",106
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Centrist parties. Centrist parties can act as a reasonable alternative to the major parties when voters are dissatisfied with the major parties. In particular, Quinn(10)shows that minor, centrist parties are most successful in electoral districts where one major party is highly dominant and the other major party is weak - this enables the minor party to appear as viable as a major party and therefore benefit from tactical and protest voting in those districts. This dynamic is specific to centrist parties.","text",107
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","More generally, Gerring also found that minor parties in majoritarian systems perform better when voters tend not to identify strongly with mainstream parties, and worse when mainstream parties are strongly organised(11).","text",108
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","With this understanding in mind, we believe that animal parties (which are minor parties by definition) will typically perform poorly in majoritarian systems:","text",109
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Animal parties are not regional. While certain demographics tend to be more supportive of animal welfare than others(12,13), the baseline support for animal parties is small (typically a few percent of the vote), so any correlation between demographics and support for animal welfare is not strong enough to concentrate potential supporters of an animal party into a specific electoral district.","text",110
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Animal parties are not really radical. While animal parties often propose some radical policy measures (e.g. the abolition of animal agriculture), animal welfare is not radical as a general topic. This means that major parties, if they feel threatened by an animal party, can safely adopt pro-animal welfare policies and therefore co-opt animal welfare as an issue(2). This means that animal parties cannot cultivate an identity that is truly and stably distinct from major parties(8). We will return to this point, as pressuring major parties into adopting pro-animal welfare policies often represents a major win in its own right. (Related to this point is the fact that radical minor parties can have animal welfare as one policy among many(14), though these parties are not really animal parties.)","text",111
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Animal parties are not really centrist. Animal parties are typically associated with left-wing and/or green politics. Notably, some animal parties are not left-wing but are single-issue(15)or even right-wing (e.g. Italy's Animalist Movement, which is not to be confused with Italy's Animalist Party). Animal welfare does attract the support of right-wing parties in some countries (e.g. the UK). In any case, it would be rare for an animal party to be positioned as the most viable centrist party for which dissatisfied voters can submit a protest vote, as required by Quinn's model(10)of centrist parties.","text",112
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Based on this reasoning, our current view is that animal parties can win seats in legislatures that are elected by proportional voting systems, and we think that animal parties will find it extremely difficult to win seats in legislatures elected by majoritarian systems. However, animal parties can definitely still influence policy in majoritarian systems - it is just a matter of influencing policy by means other than winning seats. This represents the working hypothesis on which we will structure our analysis in this report, and we would welcome any counter-arguments.","text",113
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","3.2 Contesting more elections seems better than spending more on advertising","text",114
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","In this report, we adopt the following mindset: we think it is important for animal parties to contest as many (winnable) elections as possible and to support those campaigns with sufficient resources to get the party name on the ballot, to produce an attractive policy platform, and to maintain an online presence. But we are less keen on spending large amounts on advertising for animal parties during election campaigns, once the party has those minimum sufficient resources. This is a working hypothesis, subject to future evidence.","text",115
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Tentatively, we believe that advertising for an animal party during an election campaign has a negligible effect on the number of seats won by the party. The alternative view is that advertisingisimportant, and that spending more money on advertising during a campaign would allow animal parties to win more seats.","text",116
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","In favour of the belief that advertisingisimportant:","text",117
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","It is widely believed that political advertising by mainstream parties has a meaningful effect on their vote. This belief has empirical support in some (but not all) academic studies(16‚Äì18)and in the observation that mainstream parties almost always spend lots of money on advertising during election campaigns (though that latter observation does not necessarily prove that such spending is an effective use of money)(19). On the other hand, there has been no analysis specific to animal parties, and relatively few analyses specific to minor parties.","text",118
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","The Party for the Animals in the Netherlands has witnessed a vote that is steadily increasing over time. This suggests that animal parties can increase their vote by building their popularity and profile, and advertising may be one component of this. On the other hand, there is an alternative explanation. Dinas et al(20)show that when small parties enter a legislature, they typically experience a subsequent increase in their vote because having an elected parliamentarian ""signals organisational capacity and candidates‚Äô appeal, and reduces uncertainty about parties‚Äô ideological profile"". So, the increasing profile of the Netherlands may not necessarily be related to any actual marketing.","text",119
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","In Australia, the Animal Justice Party observes higher votes at election booths where party volunteers hand out flyers to voters as they arrive(2). On the other hand, this may be correlation rather than causation - perhaps naturally higher support in a particular suburb means that there are more people willing to volunteer for the party. Also, it is unclear whether volunteers handing out flyers on election day would have the same effect as paid advertising (e.g. on social media during the election campaign).","text",120
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","In favour of the belief that advertisingis notimportant (i.e. our assumption for this report):","text",121
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","There is reason to suspect that animal parties operate differently to mainstream parties (and even differently to other types of minor parties) and are hence an exception to conventional wisdom. One view that is common in the academic literature is that minor parties tend to attract a core of voters who are committed for ideological reasons. For example, Adams et al(21)conclude that minor parties can maximise their votes if they ""maintain their policy appeal to those core voters who are drawn to them for ideological reasons"". For animal parties, this would be a small core of voters who are already strongly committed to animal rights or welfare. Securing votes from other groups of people may be less tractable. Under this view, it is far more important whether the animal party has policies that appeal to this core of voters - in this case, the party simply being on the ballot may be all the advertising that is needed to win the support of this committed core. Whether the voter sees an advertisement for the animal party may therefore be less relevant.","text",122
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Votes for existing animal parties are mostly capped within a narrow range (see data in ""5. Expanding Existing Parties""). It is common for animal parties contesting proportionally-represented elections to receive votes between 0% and 4%, but anything above this is quite rare. This suggests that, at the most, advertising can help within this narrow range, but perhaps not above it.","text",123
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","The academic literature has found that, in general, advertising ""tend[s] to produce small average effects""(19). Even if the effect of advertising is above zero, it may be small.","text",124
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","In one election in Australia, the animal party invested a high marketing spend, but received a much lower vote than expected(2). On the other hand, this is a single data point, and it is impossible to tell if the vote would have been even lower without the advertising.","text",125
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","We emphasise that the evidence for either of these beliefs is ambiguous. There is simply no data on the effects of political advertising on the vote secured by animal parties. There are a few weak pieces of evidence on both sides of this question. This is why we are sceptical about spending the movement's resources on advertising for animal parties until stronger evidence arises - we are far more confident in spending resources to ensure that animal parties are contesting all (winnable) elections.","text",126

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Note: The Italian Animalist Party did technically win a seat in the 2020 regional election in Campania, though this was a combined nomination with an environmentalist party, so we do not consider this to be a seat held by an animal party.","text",133
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","There are a couple of key takeaways from this table. Typically, seats have been won in legislatures that use proportional representation. The main exception is France, where the animal party joined a large and well-recognised alliance of parties. In Victoria in Australia, the election system involves a group voting ticket, an uncommon and unpredictable form of voting that can disproportionately benefit minor parties.","text",134
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Also, animal parties have often won seats with just 1 - 2% of the primary vote. A vote of this level can be obtained very reliably by animal parties in most places.","text",135
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Therefore, perhaps the most important strategic decision is topick the right country and legislaturein which to contest an election. In Australia, New South Wales and Victoria are the two states with the largest populations, which means that they have the largest state legislatures, which means that they have the lowest vote required to win at least one seat in a state legislature (at least in the proportionally-represented upper houses). Therefore, Australia's animal party has won seats in these legislatures, even though the party receives a very similar vote in other states.","text",136
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Beyond representation within countries, some parties have won representation in a supranational legislature: the European Parliament. Members are elected using proportional representation. The parties from Germany (Human Environment Animal Welfare Party), the Netherlands (Party for the Animals), and Portugal (Peoples-Animals-Nature) have won representation in this body. We discuss the European Parliament in greater detail below (see section 7, ""European Parliament"").","text",137

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","At least focusing on the strategy of actually winning seats, the best way for the animal advocacy movement to proceed could be to find jurisdictions that a) use proportional representation, b) have large enough legislatures that parties can be elected with just a few percent of the vote, and c) do not already have an existing animal party,orhave an animal party that could run in additional legislatures if given extra funding.","text",141
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Given the huge number of legislatures worldwide, there is still some low-hanging fruit - this is compounded by the fact that many countries have subnational legislatures at the regional/state levels, and it is common for these subnational legislatures to have power over agricultural policy anyway. Therefore, funding just a few small parties in a handful of countries could increase the power of the animal advocacy movement in legislatures worldwide.","text",142

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","In this report, we are interested in finding additional legislatures where animal parties could win seats.","text",145
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Proportionally-elected legislatures have anelection threshold- this is the minimum vote required for a party to win at least one seat in an election. Some legislatures have legally set thresholds, while others havede factothresholds determined by the number of seats available. For example, if a legislature has 20 seats, then a party would usually need to win around 5% of the vote to win a seat; but if a legislature has 200 seats, then the party would usually only need to win 0.5% of the vote. Of course, this rule of thumb is influenced by the specific election system used in a jurisdiction: there may be a legal minimum threshold (which would increase the vote required to win at least one seat); voters may be divided into multiple constituencies (which would usually increase the threshold required); votes may be transferable and cast by ranking candidates (which would usually decrease the threshold required); and so on. For our analysis, we estimate a rough ballpark threshold for each legislature based on previous elections in that legislature (combined with any legal thresholds that may exist).","text",146
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Now, how can we figure out if a new animal party might exceed the threshold necessary to win a seat? This requires making a prediction about what vote a new animal party might receive. Basically, the most agnostic way to predict a new party's vote is to look at the votes that have been received in the past by animal parties around the world.","text",147
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","The following graphs show the votes received by all animal parties around the world in elections that use proportional representation.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Hurst has had success in both proposing and amending legislation. For proposing legislation, this is most successful when Hurst can identify which government MPs may be most sympathetic to the proposed law, as those MPs can then advocate for the proposed law within the ruling party. In other cases, Hurst has proposed legislation and launched a strong media campaign. If there is sufficient support for the proposed legislation among the Legislative Council and the public, the government is incentivised to propose a near-identical piece of legislation in the Legislative Assembly, which results in the success of the policy. Amending proposed legislation can also be a successful strategy, because if an amendment to a Government Bill is agreed to by a majority of members in the Legislative Council, the Government is forced to either accept that amendment, or they may not be able to pass their own Bill. In this way, passing an amendment to a Bill can convince the Government to come to the table and negotiate on an issue.","text",222
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","The biggest roadblock limiting Hurst's work is the power of the animal agribusiness industry and their lobby groups. Another roadblock is the fact that the animal welfare portfolio is under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Agriculture, which significantly hinders policy reform (see our detailed report on this challengehere). These two roadblocks make it very challenging for Hurst to secure ambitious, large-scale reforms for farmed animal welfare. Nevertheless, Hurst does campaign for some specific farmed animal welfare issues. Hurst sees value in the attention that these campaigns draw in both the media and in parliament, which can gradually help to build support among the public and other MPs in the long-run.","text",223

Austraet was elected in the 2019 election, where she represented the party DierAnimal and received 1.32% of the vote. Austraet subsequently left the party and now sits as an independent.","text",228

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Since the Brussels Parliament has a multi-party system, Austraet can propose both laws and resolutions and have a good chance of them successfully passing. Passing any proposal requires discussions with the other parties to ensure support before the text is written. (This point may seem trivial to European readers, but in many majoritarian, two-party systems like Australia, it is extremely rare for a bill to pass unless it was submitted by the government.)","text",230
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","When we asked about Austraet's concrete policy wins, the two main examples she cited were: a new law that bans the capture and killing of wild pigeons; and a resolution to ask the minister to pressure EU policymakers to ban long-distance transport of farmed animals.","text",231
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","However, Austraet independently made the point that her most significant work is to simply raise animal welfare and veganism as issues in Parliament. Raising animal issues on the agenda makes them more legitimate as issues and encourages the other deputies (and the Minister) to shift in the right direction over time. Austraet felt strongly that while this effect is difficult to measure, it is real and important.","text",232
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Austraet emphasises that it is essential to develop good relationships with other parties and with the Minister responsible for animal welfare. In particular, being an independent deputy enables Austraet to develop these relationships without the interference of a party label or a party apparatus.","text",233
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Austraet has encountered a few key roadblocks during her term as a deputy. 1) Firstly, the Minister responsible for Animal Welfare has a large amount of control over the details of animal welfare laws and even how proposed laws are discussed. 2) Secondly, the Minister has stated that he will soon release a new, overarching welfare code, and many parties are reluctant to support Austraet's proposals while the details of the Minister's code remain unknown. This compounds a general reluctance from the other deputies to support animal welfare reforms. 3) Thirdly, Austraet is part of the opposition, rather than the government coalition. The first of these roadblocks (1) is a specific feature of the Brussels political system. The second (2) and third (3) of these roadblocks are specific features of the current policy agenda and makeup of Parliament, and may not necessarily interfere with progress in future sessions of Parliament.","text",234
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Despite these roadblocks, we discussed with Austraet the role of party politics in animal advocacy in general.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","For launching or supporting a minor political party, the most important financial support will be the first grant. Ongoing support from foundations is rarely necessary.","text",292
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Firstly, political parties have multiple sources of income (Table 6). The party would typically begin to receive income from these sources after running in the first election - the most important gap is therefore the money and other resources required to support the party during the first election. After that election, the party will have an easier time paying for itself. These sources of income include:","text",293
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Government funding for election campaigns. It is common for democratic countries to fund or reimburse political parties for election campaigns, though in some countries, receiving this funding is conditional on receiving a certain number of votes. All of our high-priority countries except for Switzerland provide government funding for election campaigns, though this typically requires surpassing 1% or 1.5% of the vote.","text",294
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Government funding for party expenses. When parties win seats, it is common for the government to fund both the salary of the parliamentarians and any expenses (e.g. staff salaries, travel expenses). All of our high-priority countries provide government funding for party expenses.","text",295
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Membership fees. The importance of membership fees depends on the party and the country. Most developed countries have witnessed a decline in party membership over time, and some countries have strict laws around private funding of political parties (e.g. Israel). On the other hand, Australia's Animal Justice Party has a disproportionately high number of members compared to its vote, perhaps suggesting that animal parties can attract a core of committed, paying members.","text",296
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Table 6 shows whether these sources of income exist in each of our high-priority countries. The table does not include membership fees, as the importance of membership fees varies strongly from party to party.","text",297
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Secondly, minor political parties are often run by volunteers - paid staff are usually limited to elected parliamentarians and their small teams, plus perhaps one or two executive or administrative staff hired by the party.","text",298
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","However, contesting an election and running a campaign costs money. Some important costs are:","text",299

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Campaign expenses, such as travel costs and advertising fees.","text",301
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","The fee or deposit required by the government to contest an election (Table 6). Among our high-priority countries, the only countries where electoral deposits are required are Japan and Sri Lanka, with the latter being very cheap(32). It is unclear if there are election deposits required to contest elections in Brazil and Chile, though we have searched and found no suggestion of election deposits in these two countries.","text",302
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Due to Japan's prohibitively high deposit, and our projection that a party in Japan would win only ~1 seat, we do not consider Japan further. Japan has an extremely high deposit of 6 million yen (roughly $40,000 USD), which must be paid in order to compete for a seat in Japan's proportionally-represented House of Councillors (national upper house)(33). The deposit in Japan is returned to the party if the party wins a seat; otherwise, the deposit is lost(34). Japan's high deposit is an anomaly among developed countries, which typically either do not require a deposit or require a deposit of only a few hundred dollars(34).","text",303
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","For our analysis of the cost-effectiveness of minor political parties, we assume that the main costs would be the first two items on that list, i.e.:","text",304
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Salary. The salaries required would be for a small campaign and administrative team (e.g. two people) to work full time for the couple of months immediately before the election. This would vary by country depending on living expenses. For example, in Israel, roughly $18,000 USD would be sufficient for two people working full-time for two months (as Israel has a GDP per capita of around $55,000 USD).","text",305
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Campaign expenses. Again, different countries would require different amounts of money for travel, advertising, an online presence, and so on. Conservatively, we think that around $15,000 USD would be plenty, and many parties would be able to get away with much less.","text",306
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","This means that an initial grant somewhere in the ballpark of $30,000 USD would probably be sufficient for one election. If a party contests multiple elections (e.g. national and regional), additional money may be required. The costs of subsequent elections would probably be lower than this initial grant, as a) the parties would have some income from having run in elections already, and b) the party would already have a website, some advertising resources, and so on. For reference, Australia's Animal Justice Party spent around $75,000 USD in the 2022 South Australian state election(2), though that campaign involved deposits for 12 candidates (an expense that would not be required in our priority countries) and an ambitious and expensive advertising plan (an expense that we think is unnecessary, as argued in this report in section 3.2).","text",307

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Here, we conduct some simple, back-of-the-envelope calculations to illustrate what the impact of winning a seat might look like. We will model the impact as follows: we assume that a new animal party is launched, and that party contests one election and has a ~70% probability of winning one seat in a legislature. We assume that party holds the seat for one legislative term (say, four years) and then never holds a seat ever again.","text",312
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","We think that this is a reasonable, conservative assumption for modelling purposes, as it lets us examine the effects of winning a single seat in a legislature - an achievable and meaningful outcome. However, we emphasise this assumption is highly conservative: in practice, an animal party that wins a seat will usually hold the seat at future elections. The vote is unlikely to decline, so a party that is elected once will probably be elected again. If anything, holding a seat makes it more likely to win additional seats in future elections, as has been shown in academic research(20)and has happened for the animal party in the Netherlands. Each of those subsequent legislative terms would generate additional impact. Some countries have multiple legislatures, and subsequent elections in different legislatures would be both cheaper (as the party would have an income and some existing online presence) and more successful (as the party's public profile would benefit from having a seat in one legislature already).","text",313
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","One challenge with modelling the impact of a seat in a legislature is that the benefits for animals hinges on which policies the legislator pursues. A legislator's choice of policy is sometimes constrained by the political agenda and policy windows. Animal parties have pursued policies that are both high-impact and low-impact (the latter often, though not always, for strategic reasons).","text",314
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Therefore, we model the impact as the sum of three types of policy. For each type of policy, we assume that the policy would be comparable to a particular type of welfare improvement.","text",315
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Big policy wins. Whether a party can achieve big policy wins depends on the context, makeup of the legislature, political agenda, and so on. These are somewhat rare. We assume that a big policy win would have an impact similar to a one-off welfare improvement for one group of farmed animals in a medium-sized country (e.g. banning mutilations for pigs; banning a particular slaughter method for fish; reducing stocking densities for chickens).","text",316
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Small policy wins. Parties will usually, but not always, be able to achieve smaller policy wins. These are more common, but affect smaller populations of animals. We assume that a small policy win would have an impact similar to banning the hunting of one group of wild animals in a medium-sized country (e.g. capturing and killing pigeons; hunting pheasants).","text",317
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Extra funding in the government budget.A couple of animal parties have been able to secure funding for local animal welfare organisations during the negotiations that set the government budget (e.g. ~$10 million USD in Portugal; ~$3.5 million USD in Australia). While these are large sums of money, they are typically limited to local organisations focused on companion animals.","text",318
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","There are at least three additional sources of impact that are real and important but that we donotinclude in the model:","text",319
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Salience. Holding a seat in a legislature causes a significant increase in the salience of animal issues both in the legislature and in the media. This means that both policymakers and the general public pay greater attention to animal issues. As Victoria Austraet in Belgium emphasised during our interview, we expect that greater salience would cause more pro-animal policies to be passed over time, but this effect is long-term and notoriously difficult to measure. For salience in the legislature, Otjes et al(3)calculated that the entry of the Party for the Animals into the Netherlands legislature caused the amount of discussion on animal issues to roughly triple. For salience in the media, the Australian Animal Justice Party legislator Emma Hurst confirmed in our interview that, since being elected to parliament, it is much easier to get media attention for her campaigns.","text",320
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Long-term policies. Parties often succeed in passing policies that make institutional or political conditions more favourable to future animal advocacy, but it is difficult to measure the impact of these policies in the short-term. Two examples are: 1) Emma Hurst secured from the New South Wales government the creation of an Animal Welfare Committee, with herself as the Chair; and 2) Victoria Austraet in Belgium passed a resolution that pressures the minister to, in turn, pressure EU policymakers to ban long-distance transport of farmed animals.","text",321
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Capitalising on the non-legislative benefits of being a legislator. This can include joining parliamentary committees, using allocated budgets to conduct campaigns outside of parliament, and so on.","text",322
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","So, for this report, we model the impact of a seat in parliament as the sum of big policy wins, small policy wins, and extra funding in the government budget. We emphasise that the true impact would include factors that we cannot model. We also make no attempt to consider counterfactual effects, knock-on impacts, and so on, as these are very complex to understand even for simple policies - however, we emphasise that these may be either immense or small and either good or bad.","text",323

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Big policy wins: In our model and under our assumptions, we predict that this component of impact is expected to help roughly 1.7 billion animals (8.1 million to 9.1 billion). From a funder's perspective, this represents 57,000 animals helped per dollar (270 to 300,000). Of course, this estimateshould not be taken literally- compared to more rigorous cost-effectiveness analyses for animal advocacy campaigns, this result is quite silly. The useful piece of information expressed by this result is that sometimes, when conditions are favourable, a legislator will be able to pass highly impactful policies that benefit farmed animals across the jurisdiction.","text",329
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Small policy wins: In our model and under our assumptions, we predict that this component of impact is expected to help roughly 6,700 animals (1,000 to 24,000).

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Meguid(39), in a seminal publication that draws on data from elections in Western Europe, argues that ""party tactics work by altering the salience and ownership of issues for political competition, not just party issue positions."" That is, both minor and mainstream parties compete for which issues are on the political agenda in the first place. Voters support the ""most credible proponent of an issue"" that those voters care about. The author also argues that minor parties, even without any electoral success, can succeed in influencing policy by forcing mainstream policies to give attention to the minor party's issue: ""By adopting either an accommodative or an adversarial strategy, the mainstream party is prioritising the niche party‚Äôs issue dimension and including it within the mainstream political debate. [...] The 'success' of the niche party‚Äôs issue is distinct from niche party electoral success.""","text",356

The author then demonstrates this with a case study of women's parties: ""Merely the emergence of women‚Äôs parties can draw attention to women‚Äôs issues but where women‚Äôs parties win seats, or appear poised to win even a small number of seats, they can trigger a process of contagion. [...] Thus, women‚Äôs parties may be useful tools for women‚Äôs movements because they provide a means to expand the opportunities for the movements to pressure larger political parties."" The author also points out that social movements that establish political parties can ""gain institutional resources accorded to such parties and, thus, expand their repertoires of contention.""","text",357
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Lindstam(26,27)addresses the long-standing observation that minor parties often receive better votes at subnational (e.g. local) and supranational (e.g. European) elections, rather than national elections. Using data from the UK and Germany, the author finds that voters are more likely to switch from mainstream parties to minor parties when those voters ""perceive a mismatch between the party they feel close to and the party perceived as best able to handle an issue of importance to them, as well as when they believe less is at stake and when they place much importance on an overlooked issue."" In other words, precisely because voters care less about subnational and supranational elections, voters use those opportunities to signal the importance of particular issues to mainstream parties by voting for minor parties focused on those issues. We find this quite interesting because agricultural policy in many countries is set at the subnational level (e.g. regional/state parliaments) or influenced by supranational policy (e.g. EU regulations).","text",358

The Democrats either held or shared the balance of power in Australia's Senate from 1981 to 2005, giving this party a powerful influence over legislation when bargaining with mainstream parties. Though the Democrats have since faced a decline, their legacy is concretely relevant to this day in Australian voters' expectations that ""there is an option beyond the major parties"" and that the Senate is an important forum for keeping the government accountable. We also note that the Democrats were led by a former minister from a mainstream party, which is consistent with broader observations about the importance of credibility and name recognition in electoral politics(24).","text",360

The author finds, contrary to previous understanding, that minor parties can be launched with a focus even on issues that are already present in political debate. The author also highlights that minor parties can exercise influence through rhetoric; one Italian party ""introduced a new language into political debate [...] which has required rival parties to react by reframing and redefining these issues differently from the past.""","text",361

Using data from elections in 16 Western European countries from 1980 to 2011 and focusing on green and radical right parties, the author finds the the strategic responses of mainstream parties ""vary with ideological position and the past electoral performance of the established parties."" In other words, a successful minor party will have different effects than an unsuccessful minor party, and right-wing mainstream parties will respond differently than left-wing mainstream parties. Minor parties are not always successful in placing their issue on the political agenda, as ""mainstream parties react strategically and assess the possible effect that politicisation of a certain issue will have on their future electoral performance."" The two major theories that have been explored in the literature - issue competition and spatial/left-right dynamics - are both important in explaining when and how mainstream parties respond to the emergence of minor parties.","text",364
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Blings(46)looks at how the success of a minor party can be bolstered by the social movement from which that minor party originally emerged.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","There is also the question of how minor parties compare to interest groups (which can include charities and non-profit organisations). This question has been studied in the sophisticated and nuanced work by Farrer(47). Asking the question of when to form an interest group versus a political party, Farrer proposes a theoretical model and tests it using empirical data from the environmental movement. Farrer's model begins with the assumption that advocates are policy-motivated and are simply searching for the best way to pursue their policies. In contrast, mainstream politicians are motivated to win and keep office. Thus, under Farrer's model, advocates choose the strategy that sends the strongest electoral threat to politicians. This threat can be sent by forming a party or by forming an interest group (or by some other strategy, such as direct action) - these are substitutable strategies. The best option depends on institutional conditions, as institutions govern both how costly it is for advocates to pick a particular strategy and how costly it is for mainstream politicians to respond to that strategy. Farrer makes two points that are particularly illuminating. Firstly, the formation of interest groups and the formation of political parties are substitutable strategies. In other words, these are both potential pathways to the goal of policy influence. Secondly, the best strategy depends on the context, including the type of political system. Specifically, new parties tend to have an easier time in obtaining policy concessions where decentralisation is high (i.e., where political power is devolved to smaller units like regions) and corporatism is low (i.e., where governments more readily listen to smaller interests). Elections that use proportional representation make it easier for new parties to enter, but proportional representation also make it a bit more challenging for new parties to obtain concessions from major parties (as the major parties find it more costly to grant concessions).","text",366

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Beyond forming minor political parties, we considered one additional strategy: voting blocs. Many interest groups have successfully organised as voting blocs in order to get their special interests prioritised by politicians. Essentially, this approach involves forming a group of voters who are willing to vote for a particular party (e.g. in a two-party system, voting for one major party rather than other). This places pressure on politicians to adopt policies amenable to the voter bloc and makes it more likely for politicians with such policies to be elected. Note that ""voting blocs"", the strategy we describe in this section, is not to be confused with ""block voting"", which is an electoral system.","text",380
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","The strength of this approach is that elections may be decided on very narrow margins. This is especially true if the voting block would otherwise vote for the largest opposition party if the demands are not met. When this happens, a voting bloc with (say) 2% of the electorate effectively makes a difference of 4% swing in the outcome of the election.","text",381
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Across many countries, farmers are a very common voting bloc. Even in wealthier countries where farmers often represent only a small proportion of the total population, they are often successful in achieving concessions from politicians(54). In addition to the power of their votes, farmers have often been highly successful in lobbying efforts. Farmers often receive a large amount of subsidies, sometimes amounting to a significant proportion of the total income. One strength of farmers as a voting bloc may be their ability to get the public on their side. Farmers are typically perceived as trustworthy and virtuous. People also tend to find food to be emotionally significant and this may be turned into a kind of nationalistic drive to protect local agriculture producers(55). Additionally, governments may have an interest in having strong domestic production of agriculture to increase their food security in cases of disaster or trade disruptions. Animal advocates may have a hard time replicating this level of societal sympathy.","text",382
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Could voting blocs work for animal advocacy? Here, we imagine voting blocs mostly in plurality elections - a group of voters could coordinate to act as kingmaker between the two major parties in a two-party system, thereby demanding pro-animal policy concessions from both parties. While not yet a very large proportion of society, vegans, vegetarians, and other animal advocates may represent a large enough portion of society to influence elections if they voted consistently along animal welfare lines. In addition to voting behaviour, the animal advocacy voting bloc could also be influenced to perform other political actions that could further amplify their political voice, such as contacting local politicians or protests.","text",383
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy","Unfortunately, we do not think this approach is well-suited to animal advocacy.

This is similar to the approximate range in which surveys estimate the prevalence of veganism in the population in many Western countries. Therefore, we suspect that this 0 - 4% is close to the upper ceiling of the size of a voting bloc.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","In this report, we identify the top opportunities for improving the lives and welfare of farmed fish in Denmark.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","To improve the lives of fish, it is important to focus on the asks that will bring about the biggest improvements in the lives of fish for a given investment of effort. One part of this is reaching as many fish as possible. By far, the groups of farmed fish with the highest numbers in Denmark are a) fish living on freshwater farms, and b) juvenile fish. Therefore, improving the lives of these two groups of farmed fish is a priority. Almost all farmed fish in Denmark are rainbow trout.","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","With this in mind, we have identified two main priority asks.","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Welfare reform for freshwater trout farms. This ask would aim to improve the welfare of trout on freshwater farms. In the Danish trout industry, the freshwater farm stage is home to 105 million individual trout every year. So, this ask could secure comprehensive welfare improvements for an immense number of fish. This ask would probably involve legislative lobbying to establish new regulations, and the first step would be to visit farms and obtain data on a collection of welfare indicators.","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Lobby for inquiry into juvenile trout welfare. This ask would involve lobbying the government to conduct an inquiry into the welfare of juvenile fish in Denmark. This would, in turn, get the industry to release more information on juvenile fish welfare and monitor the welfare of juvenile fish in the future. Every year, the industry produces roughly 148 million fingerlings and even more fry than this. The animal advocacy movement has recently turned its attention to juvenile fish, such as the work of the Norwegian Animal Protection Alliance, though campaigns are hindered by a lack of an evidence base. As a result, this ask could not only improve the lives of an immense number of fish in Denmark but also support future campaigns around the world.","text",17
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","There are a few smaller asks that would also be overall positive for the lives of fish, though the total benefit would be lower. These could be run as smaller campaigns, perhaps to secure some victories while the main campaigns are being run. These asks are: 1) increase the uptake of humane trout slaughter by farms; 2) encourage retailers to choose certification schemes that are focused on welfare; and 3) ban the live export of trout.","text",18
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","We also provide a detailed analysis of the context of Danish fish farming and detailed information about the industry, which will assist animal advocacy organisations in any campaign on fish welfare.","text",19

Of note, they go beyond minimum EU requirements in some areas, such as in requiring non-fish vertebrates to be stunned before slaughter, without exception for religion(5).

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","While not directly relevant to work on fish welfare, these factors suggest to us a relatively more ambitious work may be possible in Denmark, since the government has shown itself willing to consider animal welfare.","text",32
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Notably, the Danish Animal Welfare Act does extend to all animals, including invertebrates, though comments by the Danish Animal Ethics Council suggest that the intention behind this is that animals will receive different levels or different kinds of consideration according to their distinct biology(6).

Concerning the protection of the environment, we found the Danish government to be remarkably motivated to act. This may be particularly true because of the disproportionately large amount of agriculture that is carried out in Denmark, leading to large nitrogen emissions. The Danish government’s concerns with the environmental impact of agriculture (and aquaculture) centres around these nitrogen emissions.","text",34

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","It is unclear exactly what proportion of Denmark's trout is certified by private certification schemes - but we have a few clues.","text",47
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","In Denmark, Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) lists 31 freshwater trout farms, across 12 large companies, that are currently certified by ASC in Denmark(11). We have production data for 17 of these 31 farms that we obtained from municipalities (see Appendix). These 17 farms together produced 9,040 t of trout in 2021, which is 29% of the volume of trout produced in Denmark. If you correct for the fact that our data is incomplete, we would expect roughly 50% of the volume of trout in Denmark to be covered. Most of the farms in the dataset are large farms.","text",48
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Therefore, we would expect the proportion of ASC-certified Danish trout to be around 50%, or perhaps a little bit lower or higher. The certified production comes from 31 farms, most of which are relatively large.","text",49
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","There may also be certification schemes other than ASC that are active in Denmark. The two most important countries for retail sales of Danish trout are Germany and Denmark.","text",50
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","It appears that much of the fish sold in Germany are, or will soon be, farmed under certification schemes. See, for example, the commitments made byEdeka,LidlKaufland,Rewe,Aldi Nord, andMetro. Around 40% of the trout produced in Denmark is sold in Germany. Therefore, we would expect much of this 40% to be certified.","text",51

About 10-20% of trout produced in Denmark is consumed domestically, and we would therefore expect most of this 10-20% to be certified.","text",52
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Not all of the certification schemes mentioned by these retailers are strong for fish welfare.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Although Denmark does import farmed fish and crustacean products from other countries, we believe that it is better to focus advocacy efforts on fish produced inside Denmark. The reason is that most fish and crustaceans sold in Denmark are farmed under certification schemes, which limits the opportunities for potential campaigns that would aim to improve the welfare of these imported animals - certification campaigns are a key way to improve the lives of imported animals, while there are many more options available to advocacy organisations to improve the lives of domestically farmed animals. Of the farmed fish and crustaceans imported by Denmark, the most substantial are over 100,000 t of farmed salmon each year (from Norway and other European countries), and just under 100,000 t of farmed shrimp each year (from Vietnam, Ecuador, India, and numerous other countries)(12).","text",55

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","The structure of the Denmark fish farming industry is depicted in Figure 2. Fish farming takes place in three main stages:","text",58
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","The fry and fingerling stage involves breeding, hatching eggs, and growing the juvenile fish to fingerlings of around 50 g each. Most of these fish are transferred to on-growing, though a small number are used to stock recreational fisheries or wild fish populations.","text",59
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","The on-growing stage involves growing the fish to around 250 - 350 g on freshwater farms. A small number are subsequently grown further, to around 3 - 4 kg, on sea farms.","text",60
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","The harvest stage involves slaughter and sale. Around 100 million fish are harvested from freshwater farms each year, and around 3 million from sea farms. Stunning and slaughter are not regulated, but the industry voluntarily stuns 70% of fish before slaughter, so stunning and slaughter may also be less of a priority. Around 80 - 90% of fish are exported, mostly to other European countries and to Asia. Only around 10 - 20% of fish are consumed domestically. Of the freshwater harvest, around 30 million fish are exported live.","text",61
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","The stages with the highest numbers of fish each year are, by far, the fry/fingerling stage and the freshwater on-growing stage (Figure 3A). There are far fewer fish who experience marine on-growing, live export, and stocking fisheries or wild fish populations. This is also true if you account for the duration of time spent in each stage (Figure 3B). This suggests that it may be wise to focus fish advocacy campaigns on the fry/fingerling stage and the freshwater on-growing stage.","text",62
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","As of 2020, there are 156 trout farms in Denmark, and these produced 42,805 tonnes of trout. The number of farms has decreased over time, but the volume of fish produced has increased (Figure 4). Of the 42,805 tonnes of trout produced in 2020, around 71% was produced for consumption (the other 29% being fingerling/fry production, production for wild releases, etc).","text",63
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","There are three main types of trout farms in Denmark:","text",64
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Traditional freshwater farms. In 2020, there were 104 traditional freshwater farms in operation, producing about 36% of trout by volume(13).","text",65
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Model freshwater farms. These farms are partially recirculating and are adapted from traditional freshwater farms with the aim of reducing the emissions of nitrogens and other pollutants(14). In 2020, there were 33 model freshwater farms in operation, producing about 38% of trout by volume.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Sea farms. These farms are located in the ocean and are used to grow trout transferred from freshwater farms to larger sizes. In 2020, there were 19 sea farms in operation, producing about 26% of trout by volume.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Background","text",185
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","This ask would aim to improve the welfare of trout on freshwater farms. In the Danish trout industry, the freshwater on-growing stage is one of the two most important life-stages in terms of numbers of trout per year (the other being the fry/fingerling stage) (Figure 2). As such, this ask could secure comprehensive welfare improvements for an immense number of individual fish.","text",186
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","When it comes to campaigning for this ask, we believe that the strongest option is legislative lobbying. Legislative lobbyinginvolves working with policymakers, such as politicians and ministry employees and politicians, to establish new, legally-binding welfare standards. This type of campaign can be cost-effective, as it is possible to communicate with policymakers and establish impactful policies with a relatively small team. Furthermore, producers that adopt voluntary standards often have an incentive to advocate for those standards to become legally binding(10,25)- since there is already a lot of interest in voluntary standards in Denmark (e.g. ASC), it is possible that there is already some sufficient industry support for stronger legal regulations.","text",187
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","There are two other options for campaigning for this ask, though we consider them less suited to this particular ask in Denmark:","text",188
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Producer outreach, whichinvolves collaborating with producers to encourage them to adopt higher-welfare practices. For example, this could involve developing a new industry code of practice with the cooperation of the industry. This approach may not be well-suited to Denmark - it has tended to work best in contexts where farmers are being inefficient in some way (e.g. Indian carp farms), which is not the case in Denmark. In Denmark, this type of campaign has one advantage: most trout are produced by only a small number of enterprises, so targeting just the biggest few producers could benefit a large number of animals (see above, 'Most trout are produced by a small number of farms'). Also, these large farms would have greater financial and technical ability to implement new practices. The challenge with producer outreach would be getting industry stakeholders to agree on meaningful welfare improvements that improve on existing standards (e.g. ASC standards).","text",189
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Corporate campaigns, which involve campaigning for retailers (e.g. supermarkets) and food service providers (e.g. restaurants and hotels) to only sell food produced to high welfare standards. This type of campaign depends on leveraging public opinion to place pressure on retailers, who in turn choose to supply only higher-welfare products. The biggest weakness of this approach is that it would probably conflict with the Better Chicken Commitment (BCC) campaign in Denmark - since the BCC involves corporate campaigns, this would mean that the BCC and this campaign share many of the same target retailers. Retailers may be less keen to meet with animal advocacy groups about multiple welfare asks at the same time and will struggle with the workload to transition multiple supply chains at the same time. On the other hand, retailers of Danish trout have already demonstrated a willingness to sell products of higher ethical standards - this might mean that further corporate campaigns targeting retailers of Danish trout are tractable. Certification schemes provide an existing collection of higher-welfare practices that are bundled into a collection. Many major retailers of Danish trout already appear to have adopted certification schemes, and about half of Danish trout production is certified by ASC (see above, 'Certification schemes'). We do believe that there is room for encouraging retailers to select more welfare-friendly certification schemes (see above, 'Smaller campaigns').","text",190
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","These campaign options are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible to combine them into a larger strategy - for example, producer outreach could be used to secure buy-in from a few large farms, which could then improve the likelihood of success in making the welfare improvements legally binding across Denmark via legislative lobbying.","text",191

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","The impact of this ask strongly depends on the degree to which trout farmed in Denmark are currently experiencing welfare issues, and which specific welfare issues those are.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","How could this uncertainty be resolved? Fortunately, there is a tool that can be used to gather information about the welfare of trout farmed in Denmark. This is the FISHWELL handbook on welfare indicators for farmed rainbow trout,freely available here. This handbook identifies a number of welfare indicators that can be collected when visiting fish farms. Below, we summarise the indicators from the handbook that will be most useful for assessing fish welfare on visits to trout farms in Denmark. This can be used as a guide if you visit trout farms in Denmark, and Animal Ask is happy to provide advice and guidance for conducting these visits.","text",195
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","The welfare indicators are divided into different categories depending on how easy they are to obtain and understand:","text",196

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Here, we focus on level 1 and a few level 2 indicators, as these can be used on the farm with minimal expertise and no particular special equipment or data analysis. If you want further detail on these indicators, they are discussed in greater detail from page 152 onwards in thehandbook. We focus only on indicators that: a) are non-invasive and do not require fish handling, b) are relevant to freshwater flow-through systems, rather than sea farms, and c) are relevant on-farm. We chose to limit our attention to on-farm welfare indicators as most specific procedures would be quick and, therefore, limited in their impact on overall fish welfare relative to longer-lasting, on-farm conditions. There may be an exception if the procedure causes particularly intense suffering - this may be the case for slaughter, but we already have a decent understanding of humane and non-humane slaughter of trout in Denmark, and this is discussed throughout our report. If you're interested in indicators for specific procedures, thehandbookdiscusses indicators from page 202 onwards for crowding, pumping, slaughter, euthanasia, medical treatments, anaesthesia, vaccination, and transport.","text",201
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","The indicators are further divided into three groups: environmental indicators, which address the rearing environment; group-based indicators, which address a farm's fish population as a whole; and individual animal-based indicators, which involve looking at individual fish.","text",202

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Background","text",207
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","This ask would involve lobbying the government to conduct an inquiry into the welfare of hatchlings in the country. They would in turn get industry to release more information on the subject and monitor the welfare of hatchlings more significantly going forward.","text",208
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","There has been little attention paid to the welfare of juvenile fish. This is unfortunate because mortality rates are much higher in juveniles than in adult fish. In many cases it may be cheaper for industry to pay for additional fry and simply tolerate high mortality rates, rather than pay for welfare measures. For example, in Norway it seems to be common practice to rear 25% more fish than the hatchery has capacity for in the smolt stage, with the expectation that enough fish will die before reaching that stage because of high mortality rates(20).","text",209
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","One possible approach to encourage hatcheries to be concerned about mortality rate is to try and get subsidies implemented that are conditional on lowering mortality rates among larval fish. This might spur hatcheries to implement significant welfare reforms, whereas currently they had very little economic incentive to do this. Penalties for high mortality rates would be even better from the standpoint of limiting the profitability of the industry, but they would also be harder to implement because of opposition from the industry.","text",210
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Animal advocacy organisations have been largely silent on the specific issue of juvenile fish mortality, contributing to a lack of public pressure for industry to reform. This situation is exacerbated by a lack of research on the subject making it more difficult to improve welfare even if it were made a priority. Denmark has no information about fish mortality in aquaculture across the lifespan. This ask would begin to tackle this issue asking for the information needed to inform work on the issue.","text",211
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","However, the situation is beginning to improve with some recent research on the subject. In recent years, Norwegian Animal Protection Alliance has commissioned several reports regarding juvenile salmon in Norwegian aquaculture(20,27). The campaign might broadly replicate the work of the Norwegian Animal Protection Alliance, except in Denmark.","text",212
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Charity Entrepreneurship is also notable as one of the other few organisations considering researching work on this subject. Charity Entrepreneurship(28)considered incubating a new charity focused on milkfish welfare in the Philippines. As part of their research report on the subject, they considered whether that charity should focus specifically on juvenile welfare in that species. Though they concluded that the charity should be incubated, they did not think that there was a strong reason for it to focus on the welfare of juveniles over the welfare of adults. Nevertheless, they recommended further research on the subject. Their analysis of this issue drew primarily upon various EU countries, especially Norway.","text",213
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Despite their conclusion in that case, our analysis in the case of Denmark suggests that focusing on juvenile fish welfare may be a particularly strong ask in Denmark. In Denmark, trout typically spend around 2 ½ months growing from fry to 5 g fingerlings followed by another 2 ½ months growing from 5 g fingerlings to 50 g fingerlings. This means they spend a total of around five months in a juvenile stage. This is followed by a period of 8 to 9 months when they are kept as adults in other freshwater or saltwater facilities.","text",214
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","This means that in terms of life years, each fish that survives to the end of their life spends longer as an adult. However, the number of trout surviving until they are 50 g fingerlings versus the number who survive long enough to be slaughtered is approximately 3 to 1. This overall suggests that the bulk of life years experienced by fish and agriculture in Denmark are experienced by juvenile fish. This is especially true given that our estimates of the population of juvenile fish in Denmark agriculture assume a 0% mortality rate before growth to 50 g. This is certainly an underestimate, especially as this is the stage with the highest mortality rates.","text",215
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","The following table reviews general evidence on hatchling welfare issues in aquaculture among a range of species. However, this table does not include welfare information specific to trout in Denmark because we are unable to find that information publicly accessible. Because of this lack of data, we think that beginning work on the subject with an inquiry in order to gather this data is a particularly strong approach. (Some of the indicators described above also apply to juvenile welfare.)","text",216
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Table 5: Welfare issues facing juvenile fish. The poor state of the evidence for juvenile fish welfare has made it difficult for the animal advocacy movement to make progress on this important topic.","text",217
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","In addition to the value of his ask in informing future work on a very neglected group of animals in Denmark, we think this ask could have great value by helping inform work on this issue globally. We see the work of Norwegian Animal Protection Alliance as having had this effect, and we are keen to see others following them in advancing this cause.","text",218
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","There are many uncertainties surrounding the welfare of juvenile trout in Denmark and how to improve their welfare. This is why we believe that a research-based approach starting with the government inquiry to gather necessary data is the most appropriate path forward. We therefore do not consider the lack of evidence to be a strong reason against this ask, precisely because this ask aims to gather that evidence. We also find that the preliminary evidence suggests that work on the subject in the future will be high-impact.","text",219
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","This campaign could proceed by contacting and perhaps lobbying the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries of Denmark, or their sub-agency, The Danish Fisheries Agency. The minister responsible for this, Rasmus Prehn, could also be contacted as part of this. Another approach could be to look for a grant to pay for this work to be conducted privately, as the Norwegian Animal Protection Alliance has done.","text",220
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","As mentioned above, scientists at the National Institute of Aquatic Resources in the Technical University of Denmark are currently working to obtain funding to begin monitoring the current status of fish welfare in Denmark. These scientists may represent valuable partners for this ask, whether they a) simply offer technical or political support or b) actually carry out the research or inquiry themselves.","text",221
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Remaining uncertainty 1: Is it physically possible to improve juvenile fish survival?","text",222
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","The consideration that we think is most likely to be crucial in determining the value of future work to improve juvenile welfare is how tractable it is. Trout follow a reproductive strategy of having large numbers of offspring with very low chances of survival in most cases. The evolutionary goal of this reproductive strategy is to have fish make it to adulthood despite the high mortality rates. It is therefore possible that the higher mortality rate is, in a sense, built in, and may therefore be difficult to improve on. This is the most important key uncertainty for this ask.","text",223
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","China and Holzman(31)may provide an explanation for these higher mortality rates. They observed that mortality rates among juvenile fish were high even in ideal circumstances of the physics of the interaction of water and very small fish. During a critical period typically lasting for their first 7 to 8 days of life, larval fish have a very difficult time feeding because of the interference of water, even when prey are plentiful. They call this phenomenon “hydrodynamic starvation”.","text",224
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","These larval fish feed by suctioning food into their mouths, which is generating an inward flow of water to capture prey by rapidly expanding the mouth cavity. This process is disrupted by the hydrodynamics of water at that size, resulting in an estimated 40% loss in energy invested in opening the mouth, as well as other disruptions to this process leading them to repeatedly lose prey. As they become larger, this progressively ceases to be a problem.","text",225
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","The implications of this are that work on the welfare of juvenile fish will either have to solve this problem, or will have to make progress on other welfare issues while leaving hydrodynamic starvation, most likely the largest juvenile fish welfare problem, unsolved. The potential to improve on the extremely large mortality rates is probably the most significant draw to working on the welfare of juvenile fish, so not touching on this issue is less than satisfactory and will limit the potential of any welfare improvements to reduce the mortality among juvenile fish.","text",226
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Three potential ways of improving on this are(32):","text",227

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","We are skeptical of the tractability of any of these methods. However, this seems to be an unexplored area for welfare improvements, so we think that more research in this area to see if any of these methods or a new method could be made to work.","text",231
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","In terms of 1, we found some claims that larval trout in Denmark are currently being fed with compound food, rather than live prey such as rotifers and Artemia (brine shrimp)(14,33). This is atypical for most fish species, as most larval fish in aquaculture are fed with live food(34).Though we found some mention of the production of live food for fry in Denmark(35), consultation with an expert confirmed to us that compound food is used for larval trout in Denmark. This suggests that hydrodynamic starvation is less of an issue for trout in Denmark.","text",232
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","We remain uncertain about the significance of hydrodynamic starvation in this context. More research needs to be done on hydrodynamic starvation in aquaculture, and research on trout in particular would be very valuable. Before this is done we remain uncertain about how large of a role hydrodynamic starvation plays in Danish trout aquaculture and this should be considered speculative. All things considered, we do think that there is likely to be tractable work on the subject that could be enabled by an inquiry into hatchling welfare.","text",233

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","This ask would involve getting 100% of trout in Denmark to be stunned before slaughter. As of 2017, about 70% of trout slaughtered in Denmark are stunned before slaughter, and about 30% are slaughtered using asphyxia in ice(38). Asphyxia in ice is horrible for the trouts' welfare and causes extreme suffering, whereas effective stunning before slaughter can avert much of this extreme suffering(38).","text",237
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","This ask benefits a sizeable minority of fish (30% of trout farmed in Denmark). This ask would only benefit these fish for a small percentage of their life, i.e. during slaughter, which lasts minutes. However, the suffering experienced during slaughter is extreme. There are certain philosophical views that propose that preventing this extreme slaughter is a high priority(39,40). As such, some thoughtful advocates believe that preventing the extreme, short suffering at slaughter could be overall better for fish than preventing the low-intensity, long suffering during the rest of these animals' lives(39). While this ask only benefits 30% of trout slaughtered in Denmark for a short period, the ask could nevertheless bring a disproportionately high benefit for the lives of these trout - we believe that this ask is a suitable small campaign for this reason.","text",238
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","We think that this could be a good campaign for legislative lobbying. Other organisations around the world have had success with legislative lobbying for humane fish slaughter. Also, since 70% of trout slaughtered in Denmark are already stunned (and this is probably mostly large farms), it is possible that the aquaculture industry will express minimal resistance to this campaign. In fact, farms that already stun the fish may even be incentivised to support this campaign - a new legal requirement to stun fish before slaughter will impose costs on farms that do not stun fish, which benefits competing farms that do stun fish.","text",239
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","A survey by the European Commission reports that the 30% of trout who are slaughtered via asphyxia are slaughtered on-farm. In contrast, the 70% of trout who are stunned before slaughter are slaughtered at dedicated slaughterhouses.","text",240
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","One way to begin working on this ask would be to contact farms that slaughter trout via asphyxia and ice and ask the farm owners about their barriers to implementing humane slaughter. As a general rule, smaller fish farms find it more difficult than larger farms to afford an investment in stunning equipment. In early 2022, Animal Ask surveyed manufacturers of humane fish slaughter equipment in Europe. An electrical stunning machine (e.g. manufactured by Ace Aquatec) costs around 100,000 EUR (740,000 DKK). The necessary pump (e.g. manufactured by FAIVRE or VAKI) and dewatering unit (e.g. manufactured by IRAS) might add an additional 50,000 EUR (370,000 DKK). Please do not hesitate to contact Animal Ask for more details on these prices if you are interested in campaigning for humane fish slaughter.","text",241
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","For farms that cannot afford to purchase this equipment on their own, creative solutions exist(38). Some countries have mobile slaughterhouses which travel between farms to stun and slaughter fish. Some countries also have cooperatively owned slaughterhouses that allow multiple small farms to combine money to invest together in the stunning equipment. It may also be possible to campaign for government subsidies for farms that want to purchase or rent slaughter equipment. Speaking with trout producers in Denmark might help to clarify which of these, or other, strategies would help farms to adopt stunning before slaughter.","text",242

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Most retailers in Denmark and Germany have committed to ensuring that the fish products they supply will be mostly or completely certified by private certification schemes. This seems to have been partially motivated by a campaign by WWF. However, the policies adopted by these retailers - and, therefore, the choice of certification scheme - are focused on sustainability, not welfare. Many of the policies adopted by the retailers are also vague as to the specific certification schemes that will be used. About half of Danish trout production is certified by Aquaculture Stewardship Council.","text",244
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","It may be possible to meet with these retailers and encourage them to pick certification schemes that are strong on both sustainability and fish welfare. This could secure some relatively easy wins without a big campaign - it could be possible to make the retailers' choice of certification schemes more welfare-friendly simply by sharing resources likeAquatic Life Institute's benchmark report. This campaign would be small, involving just a few meetings with retailers, but could nevertheless secure some early victories and improve the lives of many fish.","text",245
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","The biggest concern is that this campaign would require meetings between the animal advocacy movement (or your organisation specifically) and Denmark's major retailers. Animal advocacy organisations are already working hard to convince Denmark's major retailers to adopt the Better Chicken Commitment. As such, this ask may conflict with the Better Chicken Commitment campaign in Denmark. Therefore, we encourage you to try this small campaign if you think you can secure commitments without too much effort, but keep in mind that this campaign may also come at the cost of making the Better Chicken Commitment campaign more difficult.","text",246

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","About one-third of trout produced in Denmark are exported live. This ask would involve campaigning to ban the live export of fish from Denmark. We believe that this ask could form a suitable small campaign which, although it brings a relatively small-scale benefit, can avoid a period of relatively intense suffering (transport) and has very few risks. We think that this campaign may also be tractable to achieve as it would probably represent only a minor disruption to supply chains (i.e. exporting dead fish rather than live fish).","text",248
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","All of the trout exported live from Denmark are destined for other countries in Europe.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","We estimate that about 31 million individual trout are exported live from Denmark each year.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","However, the journey duration is only a very small proportion of the trouts' lives. The exact journey duration is unclear, but we expect it would be within the vicinity of about 12 hours. This is a typical long journey duration for live animal transport in the EU, and it takes about 8 hours to drive from Jylland to Germany. This would indicate that only around 400,000 animal-years are experienced by fish during live export from Denmark each year. This is a very small number and almost negligible compared to other stages of production - compare the 400,000 animal-years to, say, the 79 million animal years experienced during on-growing on freshwater farms each year (Figure 3B).","text",251
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","We have not found any evidence on the welfare conditions experienced by fish exported live from Denmark. However, in general, fish can suffer from a range of welfare problems during live transport which relate to stocking density, handling, water quality, water movement, loading and unloading, physical damage, air exposure, and food deprivation(38,41–43). Handling and transport commonly cause acute and chronic stress with transported fish showing physiological stress responses(42,43).","text",252
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Banning live export from Denmark would mean that 31 million trout are slaughtered domestically, rather than being exported live, each year.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Our main concern about this ask is the tractability. We do not know why the industry exports trout live - there may be a price premium in the destination countries due to the freshness of live-exported trout. If the industry is strongly incentivised to continue this practice, then this ask might be difficult to achieve. Due to this uncertainty, we encourage you to keep in mind the tractability during the early stages of this campaign - if it appears that this campaign would require a large amount of effort to succeed, then it might make sense to instead swap to one of the other smaller campaigns we discuss in this article.","text",254
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","There are very few risks with banning the live export of trout. The biggest risk involves the method by which these trout would be slaughtered domestically if live export were banned. As of 2017, about 70% of trout slaughtered in Denmark are stunned before slaughter, and about 30% are slaughtered using asphyxia in ice (see below)(38). Asphyxia in ice is horrible for the trouts' welfare, whereas effective stunning before slaughter can avert much of the extreme suffering caused by slaughter. In Poland (about 19% of trout), it appears that all rainbow trout are slaughtered via asphyxia in ice - in this case, being slaughtered in Denmark would represent an improvement. We are unsure how rainbow trout in Germany are slaughtered - other species (e.g. carp) do appear to be stunned before slaughter(38). If most trout imported by Germany are stunned before slaughter, then being slaughtered in Denmark instead could be a bad thing. This would also depend on how Danish companies respond to a ban on live export - the fish could be transported to slaughterhouses before being killed and exported. Since fish slaughterhouses in Denmark do generally own stunning equipment(38), this would mitigate the risk that fish would be slaughtered via asphyxia in ice.","text",255

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Sea farms produced 11,291 t of trout in 2020. Sea farms slaughter trout at approximately 3-4 kg. This means that, in 2020, sea farms slaughtered roughly 3.2 million individual trout. On sea farms, the on-growing period on sea farms lasts for approximately 8 months. This means that, in 2020, there were roughly 2.2 million animal-years experienced by trout on sea farms. Sea farms account for only a minority of the number of fish and number of animal-years farmed in Denmark (Figure 2).","text",264
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Preventing these 3.2 million individual trout from experiencing this suffering at sea would reduce the scale of the trout industry in Denmark.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Every ask that aims to reduce the production of animals will, to some extent, cause demand to switch to other products. In this case, it is possible that switching to other products will actually cause more animals to be farmed overall.","text",268
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","The evidence suggests that consumers would switch from large-size trout to salmon. Consumers would probably not switch from large-size trout to small-size trout as large- and small-size trout are perceived as different products. On the fish market, consumers' substitution between different fish products appears to be based on characteristics like flesh and processing rather than the species of the fish(24). Sea farms produce large-size trout with pink flesh, and these large-size trout are generally used for smoking or sold fresh(18). In contrast, freshwater trout farms produce portion trout with mostly white flesh, and these portion trout can be sold whole, sold as fillets, or used for smoking(18,44). (Note that most of Denmark's trout are exported to other countries, like Germany and other countries in Europe and Asia.) Shutting down sea farms would reduce the amount of large-size trout on the market. Since portion trout and large-size trout are considered different products, we expect that consumers would not substitute toward portion trout. Rather, we expect that consumers could substitute toward products like salmon, which are a similar product to large-size trout (pink flesh, large-sized, and sold whole or smoked)(45). It has been shown in both the German and Japanese fish markets that large-size trout compete with salmon(44,45). We spoke to one expert who also believed that consumers would substitute from large-size trout to salmon, not to small-size trout.","text",269

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","RAS (Recirculation Aquaculure System) is a form of aquaculture that reuses water through enhanced filtration, reducing the need for an influx of fresh water from another source, such as a stream or spring. While full recirculation of this kind has not yet been implemented for trout in the country, partial recirculation systems are used (model 1 and model 3 farms), and there are plans by government and industry for this to become the future of aquaculture production in the country.","text",318
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","The only FREA (Danish acronym for fully recirculating aquaculture system) currently operating in Denmark are for the farming of eels and salmon (interview proceedings). This takes place at a more limited scale (2,000 tonnes of eels per year) than the farming of trout(17).","text",319
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","The following table (Table 7) shows the meaning of different levels of recirculation. In this diagram, model 3 farms correspond to “RAS low level” and FREA would roughly correspond to “RAS super intensive”. Meanwhile, model 1 farms have a lower level of recirculation, around 70%(14).","text",320

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Of these systems, traditional trout farming operations are still the most common with recirculation farms making up only a relatively small proportion of operations. In 2020, there were 33 recirculation farms (model 1 and model 3), compared to 104 traditional freshwater farms (see above, ""The fish farming industry in Denmark""). However, partial recirculation farms are more productive per farm, so they still make up just over a third of total production numbers (Figure 4).","text",323
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","However, the greatest promise of FREA for the Danish government and for industry are the environmental benefits, the most significant of which is the reduction in nitrogen emissions. However, Jokumsen and Svendsen(14)note that the theoretical emissions from FREA systems would be 38 kg of nitrogen per tonne of trout produced, which is only a small reduction in emissions from the 40 kg of nitrogen per tonne of trout produced on current model 3 farms. This would suggest that there is not a strong environmental reason for switching to FREA.","text",324
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Welfare impacts","text",325
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","Concerning RAS systems in general, Fish Welfare Initiative(53)writes that “Any risks to fish welfare must be identified before production starts, and then risk mitigation plans must be incorporated into operational procedures: the number and species of fish to be produced, staff training, backup systems for emergencies, proper monitoring and operational routines, proper disinfestation procedures, and alarm technology all must be considered”. This highlights the importance of working on welfare reforms in these systems in advance.","text",326
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","The highest priority welfare improvement for FREA is most likely ensuring adequate biosecurity measures. When biosecurity measures are carried out effectively in RAS, the risk of disease is much lower. However, if biosecurity measures fail and pathogens enter the system, the spread of the disease can be rapid because of the high stocking densities. The risk of this happening is somewhat lower compared with RAS systems in FREA where a smaller amount of external water is taken in, eliminating one potential source of pathogens. It is therefore particularly important for FREA to build biosecurity measures into the design of the whole system, rather than adding them afterwards as an afterthought. When biosecurity measures fail, pathogens can spread rapidly because of the high stocking densities in RAS and because of the difficulty of treating disease outbreaks without disrupting the biofilter. This makes it particularly appropriate as a welfare measure to stress in advance(54).","text",327

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","So far, the use of recirculation technology (model 1 and model 3 farms) has been growing in Denmark. Between 2005 and 2011, 30% of Danish trout aquaculture production moved from traditional aquaculture operations to partial recirculation farms(23). Though this is not full recirculation technology, it still suggests that the industry is moving in the direction of recirculation.","text",341
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","However, one reason that FREA might not be adopted on a wide scale in Denmark is because, while it is more environmentally friendly in terms of nitrogen emissions, greenhouse gas emissions can sometimes be considerably larger. Tilman and Clark(55)finds that some recirculation systems have substantially higher greenhouse gas emissions than traditional aquaculture, mainly stemming from increased electricity usage. This may mean that if the acute nitrogen pollution problem in Denmark can be solved in other ways, this trade-off may no longer be seen as desirable. However, an easier solution would be for farms to simply adopt the practices of those farms with lower emissions. If this means that this concern is unlikely to pose a serious obstacle to the adoption of recirculation systems.","text",342

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark","From our research, it looks as though FREA is broadly similar to RAS in which welfare improvements are most important. It appears as though FREA resembles an extreme version of RAS, and that welfare benefits and issues are magnified in FREA compared to other RAS systems. This suggests that the same general precautions are required in both RAS and FREA systems, limiting the effectiveness of this ask again.","text",345

"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY","text",9
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Factory farming and other forms of animal exploitation represent an unimaginably large amount of suffering, as well as other grave ethical concerns. Despite concern for animals being arguably at an all-time high and the many apparent successes of corporate campaigns, meat consumption has been rising (Tim and Nathan 2019). In the face of this seemingly bleak situation, many animal advocates placed hope in cultured meat, but recent analyses from outside the industry have been pessimistic about the prospects for this technology, leaving some animal advocates without hope for victory. This report outlines how victory might be achieved with the patience and dedication of the movement.","text",10
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","To develop a sophisticated theory of change, we must understand what victory might look like and what the most plausible avenues to it are. A well thought out theory of change allows us to make this kind of alignment between our actions and our ideals. Current actions that do little to contribute to our most plausible victory scenarios could then be reconsidered and actions that contributed substantially towards these scenarios could be reinforced.","text",11
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","For example, we find that welfare reforms have made strong, tangible progress, and so remain a strong option for now, but may have difficulty in later stages. In contrast, sudden progress approaches like ballot initiatives and fundamental rights, that potentially achieve rapid progress for animals, may struggle to achieve their goals for now, but may become more promising once more progress has been made and ambitious asks become more realistic.","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Turning to animal product replacements, we find the reasons for thinking that cultured meat will inevitably lead to victory for the movement (by replacing all or most animal products), are far less compelling than they formerly were. Plant-based meat represents a pathway that will likely play an important role in assisting other pathways, but is less likely to lead to strong progress on its own¹. In contrast, other alternative protein technologies represent a kind of wild card, which may result in a great deal of progress or may not result in any progress.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","We also review the respective arguments for abolitionism and animal protectionism since this was a crucial consideration in this report. We conclude that strong forms of abolitionism, such as those defended by Francione, are not well supported, but that there are lessons around framing from abolitionism that animal advocacy organisations should take on board.","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","This is a broad, thorny and speculative subject, so our conclusions should be treated as tentative and preliminary. We have tried to appropriately qualify our conclusions to reflect this background level of uncertainty; however, it would clutter the writing to insert all of the necessary qualifiers and so we hope the reader will understand that this is a speculative subject and that our statement should be interpreted in that light.","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","WHAT WOULD VICTORY LOOK LIKE?","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","As a shorthand, this report will use the term victory to refer to a range of possible outcomes in which the animal advocacy community achieves its goals. There are different conceptions of what this might look like. At a minimum this would involve the end of state-sanctioned factory farming in many countries, and many might also call for the end of all animal farming, as well as further steps to protect the interests of animals.","text",17
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Different moral theories have more substantive answers to this question. For example, consequentialist theories would want to see a future where animal interests are properly taken into account in human decisions such that the well-being of animals is maximised (Sinnott-Armstrong and Zalta 2015). It is sometimes thought that utilitarianism would not necessitate fully ending animal agriculture or other forms of animal exploitation. However, there are utilitarians who dispute this. They argue that we should end all animal farming based on the implausibility of producing animal products in a way that does not involve suffering and because the consumption of meat may lead to judgements of animals as having less moral worth, potentially leading to us disregarding their interests in other ways (Reese 2018; Bastian et al. 2012; Vinding 2014; Ozden 2022).","text",18
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","There are also consequentialist views that place special importance on improving the lives of the worst off. Versions of these theories include negative utilitarianism, the view that suffering has stronger moral weight than happiness; egalitarianism, the view that equal distributions of well-being are especially valuable; and prioritarianism, the view it is especially important to improve the wellbeing of the worst off. These views will be especially inclined to reject all animal exploitation because animals are among the worst off of beings alive today (Vinding 2014; Animal Ethics n.d., n.d.).","text",19
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Rights-based approaches in contrast may view certain actions as wrong if they violate the rights of individuals, even if those actions increase overall well-being. They may also call for a broader range of rights than simply those that directly concern well-being (Alexander and Moore 2007)². Rights-based approaches are sometimes seen as calling for more radical changes, though this is not necessarily the case. For example, Alasdair Cochrane (2012) argues that most animals do not have a right to certain forms of liberation, because they are not beings like us to whom autonomy is valuable so do not have an interest in it. Note that he still believes that they have an interest in some forms of liberation, such as liberation from confining cages that stop them from performing natural activities.","text",20
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Consequentialist theories can also have more radical implications than rights-based theories because consequentialist theories are famously more demanding than rights-based theories. Some argue that consequentialist theories should have no limits on how much they can morally demand of individuals (Kagan 1989). Notably, most consequentialist theories imply that we should help animals in the wild whenever we can do so without more harm than good (Horta 2017; Animal Ethics n.d.). Moreover, some argue that there are many cases when intervention could be beneficial and that in the future we will be in an even better position to help because of greater technology and knowledge (Horta 2017).","text",21
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Francione offers a harder line rights-based approach (Francione and Garner 2010). He would like to see the end of all treatment of animals as property. This would include ending all use of animals from animal agriculture, animal testing, the use of animal products for clothing, and even the use of animals as companions. Francione focuses chiefly on the use of animals as problematic, rather than their suffering. This goal is shared by the Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP n.d.). We will discuss the methods of NhRP and Francione in greater detail later in the report.","text",22
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","In this report we will use the term “victory” or “victory for the animal advocacy movement” loosely to refer to this range of scenarios. For further discussion of the goals that animal advocacy organisations might have beyond the farmed animal context, see the section “After animal farming”.","text",23
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","VICTORY SCENARIOS","text",24
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Here we will review evidence behind the different potential pathways to victory. It appears most likely to us that if victory is achieved it will happen for a variety of these pathways, with each of them synergistically boosting the others (interview proceedings). This is because no single pathway seems much more likely than another and because there are plausible accounts of how each may support others, such as by increasing public concern, making raising animals less appealing for the industry, and presenting alternatives. Many pathways share these instrumental goals, and so will naturally support each other. This has been called “an ecology of social change”, with different organisations playing complementary roles in the ecosystem (Cockburn 2018).","text",25
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","An example of this is the “radical flank effect”. This refers to the interplay between a radical flank of the movement and more moderate wings. They can function as foils to each other, enhancing respectively how radical or moderate their messages are. In particular, the radical flank can help shift public perceptions about what is acceptable discourse, which can help the message of the moderate wing ultimately become accepted. However, there is also the potential for negative reactions to moderate flank effects. The moderate wing may come to be equated with the radical wing, or at the very least responsible for it, discrediting the moderate message and producing a backlash against it (Haines 2013).","text",26
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Having different groups with different levels of radicalness and differing views also allows the movement to capture the enthusiasm of many different people. Some might be turned off by a more radical approach, opting instead for a more moderate one, whilst a moderate approach might be too tame for others who will be drawn to the radical group.","text",27
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","For these reasons, in most cases, the optimal distribution of movement resources will not be that the approach with the strongest arguments for effectiveness gets all the resources. Instead, the optimal approach will likely be a mix of priorities amongst different organisations. A diversity of approaches may be effective because it allows the movement to learn from trial and error and achieve results that particular approaches are better at achieving while avoiding diminishing returns (Ozden 2022). Having said this, some approaches have evidence of larger effects and so warrant a larger share of movement resources. Some approaches may also be counterproductive or harmful and so may warrant no movement resources.","text",28

"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Reformed into adequacy or out of existence","text",30
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","A commonly imagined pathway – and one that is arguably assumed by most animal advocacy organisations – is that of incremental progress through a series of corporate and legislative welfare reforms. This is exemplified by the large investment in and apparent successes of corporate campaigns, as well as other welfare reform work. They suggest steady progress towards victory.","text",31
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","The reform pathway could lead to a much smaller number of higher welfare animals as welfare reforms progressively increase both the welfare and the price of meat. This could be regarded as an adequate situation by some, and it is also possible that this effectively shuts down the industry by making farming unprofitable with competition from alternative proteins.","text",32
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Corporate campaigns have been astonishingly effective in securing commitments for welfare reforms. For example, over one third of hens in the US (over 100 million) are now cage free, up from 7% in 2015. The successes have been mirrored in Europe as well with the proportion of cage free hens in Italy and France approximately doubling over the same period(“Ten Big Wins for Farm Animals in 2021 - EA Forum” 2021). The Humane League(Evans 2021)estimates that 85% of corporate commitments to go cage free by 2020 have been met. This has been achieved through a substantial proportion of effective animal advocacy funds, an estimated 60% of their total spending(Ozden 2021).","text",33
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","This is arguably much more tangible progress than has been seen elsewhere from animal advocacy organisations. It might then seem reasonable to expect that corporate work of this kind will be primarily responsible for driving the animal advocacy community to victory. If progress continues in a similar way, this could happen by a series of incremental, though rapid, welfare reforms ultimately leading to the end of factory farming.","text",34
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","There is some indication that corporate campaigns have worked synergistically with legislative reform. For example, the cage free commitments that corporate campaigns have been particularly successful in achieving may have paved the way for the EU’s historic pledge in 2021 to phase out the use of cages(EA Forum 2022).","text",35
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Despite the success in achieving welfare reforms, some might be sceptical about the ability of the reform pathway to lead to victory. For example, some people who are influenced by abolitionism might think that corporations will only be willing to go so far and that, perhaps, they have agreed to these reforms because they are reasonably cost-effective for the corporation to make, but that critical reforms will be much more expensive and this is where we will see progress stall.","text",36
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","An advocate for corporate campaigns might reply that this is based on more speculative theory and that the corporate campaigns approach has much stronger empirical support. If at a later date the progress begins to stall, we can re-evaluate at that point, but it does not make sense to abandon a well-supported approach based on speculative theory. For more discussion of this debate, see section Crucial Consideration 1: Abolitionism Versus Protectionism.","text",37
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Another line of criticism against corporate campaigns is the relative amount of investment going into them. The user Kato on the Effective Altruism Forum(EA Forum 2022)acknowledges the successes that corporate campaigns have had but thinks that there is somewhat more relative investment in them than is optimal. Their chief concern with the current level of investment in corporate campaigns is that a broader, more pluralistic approach would enable the animal advocacy movement to learn and grow more effectively. This does not represent any strong criticism of the corporate campaigns approach, it is just an argument that focusing a majority of resources on corporate campaigns may be a mistake.","text",38
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Because of the particularly tangible progress that has been made with the reform pathway, it seems particularly promising. A downside may be that each welfare increase is relatively small, considering what we might imagine an average member of the public would find acceptable and it is possible that, at least in the future, more ambitious asks will be more effective.","text",39
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Additionally, more so than any other pathway, the reform pathway falls afoul of the abolitionist critique that it may reinforce some of the practices that it seeks to change. We argue later that the strong form of this critique, as put forward by Francione, is misguided, but there are some remaining worries around framing welfare reforms that people working on the reform pathway should take heed of.","text",40
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","The reform pathway may be a strong option for now because of the tangible welfare progress that it has made and because it can increase costs to industry and/or consumers, making alternatives more attractive. A weakness of the reform pathway is that it may be difficult for it to make the final push towards ending animal farming. It may leave us with a small number of farmed animals with higher welfare standards, but may therefore not satisfy more ambitious theories of victory(Ozden 2022), though at that point a full ban would no longer be a large step and could be pushed for directly.","text",41
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Fundamental rights","text",42
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","In contrast to this incremental approach, the most prominently discussed way that change can happen more suddenly, from the top down, is through a successful court case or successful push for legislation for fundamental rights. One example of this that is held up in the animal advocacy movement is an event in the anti-slavery movement in the UK. This is the case of Somerset vs. Stewart, which put considerable pressure on the institution of slavery in the UK³(Cotter 1994).","text",43
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","The Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP) uses cases like this as a model for how we could grant fundamental rights to animals such as chimpanzees or whales for whom the case under the law is strongest⁴. They take cases for particular animals who have been mistreated such as Happy the elephant and Kiko the chimpanzee and file a writ of habeas corpus on their behalf. Habeas corpus is used in possible cases of unlawful detention and when applied the detainee is brought before the court to determine if the detention is indeed unlawful. The NhRP claim if the court agrees that habeas corpus applies in the case of the animal, that establishes personhood for the animals. They argue for this to be done because the animals have the right to liberty and bodily integrity. They suggest that the animals could be sent to sanctuaries instead.","text",44
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Fundamentally, NhRP believe that our legal system either recognises them as persons or as property, and they regard this property paradigm as responsible for most of the harms that they suffer. They imagine that this could be extended to many other animals, through future legal work which could imply the end of animal farming or even broader implications for treatment of animals (see our After Animal Farming section)(Wise 2014; NhRP n.d.). However, speculatively, the personhood and autonomy arguments might be harder to make with animals such as farm animals who are sometimes perceived as less cognitively complex and less similar to us. This may mean that there is significantly more work to be done after sapient animals are recognised as bearers of fundamental rights in many countries.","text",45
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","There have already been limited small-scale successes in granting fundamental rights and even personhood to the sapient animals. Most of these cases have been through legislation rather than court battles. The most significant case is that the Balearic Islands, an autonomous archipelago in Spain, granted effective legal personhood to great apes. This was followed by an approval by the Spanish Parliament to extend this to the rest of Spain(Glendinning 2008). There have been various other cases that came close to granting great apes and some other animals legal personhood but have fallen short in various ways(Wise 2014)","text",46
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","This idea that change will come suddenly is supported by the punctuated equilibrium theory of policy change and was first proposed by Frank Baumgartner and Brian Jones(Baumgartner and Jones 2010)in the context of lobbying. According to this theory, there are periods of stagnation and policy change, punctuated by periods when there is much greater change. These periods of much greater change occur when the interest groups supporting the change are able to shift the framing around the policy, as well as the understanding of it and the underlying culture(Baumgartner and Harris 2020). For example, currently the framing around animal agriculture could be said to be that it is natural, traditional, and wholesome, and with this dominant narrative, as well as the reluctance of government to address the status quo, change is unlikely. However, if the framing could be shifted towards the typical animal advocate view of animal agriculture as being industrial, cruel, and unsustainable, change might begin to happen rapidly.","text",47
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","One part of punctuated equilibrium theory is that issues are often seen as either problems or as solutions to problems(Baumgartner and Harris 2020). Therefore, if animal advocacy organisations can successfully shift the view of animal agriculture from being asolutionto the problem of a supply of healthy protein, to a view of it as aproblemof animal cruelty, environmental degradation, and global hunger, rapid progress may begin to be made.","text",48
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Some examples of cases where societal changes were achieved suddenly (at least in Western countries) are same-sex marriage and the rejection of smoking(Baumgartner and Harris 2020). For example, in the height of tobacco use in the US, 45% of surveyed adults reported smoking a cigarette in the last week, compared to only 16% in 2021(Courtney Dillard, Tess Morrison, Marcy Regambal, Alan Presburger, n.d.). In contrast, many other advocacy causes (including animal advocacy itself) do not appear to have had this kind of rapid success.","text",49
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","We remain uncertain about which of the respective views of sudden or incremental progress is correct. Speculatively, we see a sudden victory as unlikely at this time, and we see incremental approaches as valuable in moving us forward for now, but later on more ambition may be called for and may be more effective in achieving more rapid changes.","text",50
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Consumer choice","text",51
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","A simple possible pathway to victory is through more and more people becoming vegan. This could happen through outreach efforts convincing more and more people to become vegan, adding further strength to the movement, and eventually a tipping point could be reached when veganism becomes the moral mainstream. This is arguably the pathway that Francione and some other abolitionists assume as at least the appropriate way to make progress in the short term. Though it might be impossible to get close to a moral consensus on this issue, once a tipping point was reached it would be much easier to get legislation passed to abolish the remaining vestiges of the industry.","text",52
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","However, the principal shortcoming of the consumer choice pathway is that it seems that moral advocacy to individuals on social issues such as animal farming is difficult(Tamler 2011). The animal advocacy movement used to rely more on the consumer choice pathway, but it has since moved away from this approach in response to more rigorous studies finding at least forms of individual outreach being much less effective than expected. Recent studies on leafleting suggest that it is not an effective intervention and may in fact accomplish nothing(ACE 2013)and the evidence for online ads has also been lacklustre⁵(Reese 2016). Additionally, despite what looks like greater cultural enthusiasm for the diets, it is not clear that rates of vegetarianism and veganism do not appear to have increased substantially over time, despite advocacy efforts(Reese 2018).","text",53
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Reese(2020)argues that this kind of individual focus has a number of shortcomings including lack of successful historical precedents, the defensiveness it arouses, and the comparative difficulty of individual versus institutional solutions, amongst other reasons. Additionally, a survey by Sentience Institute shows that a majority of survey experts thought that institutional messaging is a stronger advocacy option (note that Jacy Reese Anthis and Kelly Anthis are included among the 21 experts that they surveyed)(Anthis 2017).","text",54
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","A recent study by Faunalytics(Polanco 2022)evaluated many types of individual outreach. Of these, they recommended social media posts and news articles on animal advocacy because they reduce meat consumption in meat avoiders and did not have a negative backlash effect on meat eater behaviour. Animal advocacy videos, leaflets, and celebrity endorsements were also weakly recommended by them based on this evidence. This data is more optimistic about outreach, but many methods were still not put in the recommended categories due to either limited evidence or weak evidence of negative effects.","text",55
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Similarly, Mathur et al.(2021)conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 100 studies on the effect of different advocacy techniques on meat consumption. They conclude that certain interventions are indeed promising, though they also highlight limitations such as reliance on self-report and the short-term nature of the studies. They call for more rigorous studies and analysis of the most promising interventions that they identified.","text",56
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Moving from reviews and meta-analyses to another strong form of evidence, Carfora et al.(2017)conducted a randomised control trial using daily text messaging and documented a decrease in processed meat consumption from 3.13 to 1.74 portions of processed meat consumed throughout the week. The participants were undergraduates.","text",57
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Though it may be unlikely to constitute a pathway in its own right, public choice and opinion remains an important background factor in many of the other pathways. Public opinion in particular is arguably a very significant driver, or even the most important driver, of many of the other pathways. For example, animal advocacy organisations are able to exert pressure and ultimately secure reforms during corporate campaigns because of the actual or potential public backlash. Similarly, legislative reforms may be much more likely if politicians can be shown that their constituency is very supportive of the reform.","text",58
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","The consumer choices of the public in reducing animal product consumption in favour of plant-based products (eventually cultured meat products) can also have a significant impact. However, despite this strong supporting role, as long as moral concerns do not play a large role in dictating many of their purchasing decisions, it may be hard for much change to be driven from consumer decisions.","text",59
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","It may also be the case that political and corporate interests can successfully oppose the demands of public opinion in some cases, so majority public support for something may often not be enough to get it passed. Overall, there is some positive evidence of some forms of moral advocacy as an approach, though evidence is limited.","text",60
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Ballot initiatives","text",61
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Another way in which victory could be achieved is through ballot initiatives. Ballot initiatives are particularly notable here for their potential to achieve sudden striking results for the animal advocacy movement. Ballot initiatives are a form of direct democracy that are distinguished by both being created by the public and voted on by the public, unlike referenda which are voted on by the public but created by the legislator(Schukraft 2020). Ballot initiatives are not widely practised, with 24 US states and Switzerland being responsible for most of them.","text",62
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Nevertheless, some important victories for animals have been achieved with ballot initiatives. In the US, amendment 10 in Florida banned gestation crates and proposition 204 in Arizona banned gestation crates and veal crates. Finally, proposition 2 in California banned gestation crates, veal crates, and battery cages(Schukraft 2020). Meanwhile, Sentience Politics has been active in Switzerland. In 2016, they led a ballot initiative to require schools and town halls in Lucerne, Basel, Zurich, and Berlin to offer at least one vegan option per day. They are also currently working on a ballot initiative to ban factory farming in Switzerland and a ballot initiative to extend fundamental rights to primates in Basel(SP n.d., n.d.).","text",63
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Ballot initiatives offer the promise of being a sort of direct conduit of public opinion. When public opinion is indeed favourable this stands to be very useful. There are some indications that this is the case. For example, this Sentience Institute survey(J. R. Anthis 2017)found that a total of 47% of the US public supported a ban on slaughterhouses (14% strongly agree, 10% agree, and 17% somewhat agree). If this is accurate it could be taken as strong support for pursuing bold ballot initiatives now, as Sentience Politics’ ballot initiative to ban factory farming in Switzerland(SP n.d.). However, the answers to the Sentience Institute survey are strongly at odds with this result, suggesting that public opinion is inconsistent, but overall not yet strongly favourable towards animals. As such, we think these survey results should be treated with extreme caution, though note also that a poll by Viva! in the UK found even higher support for banning factory farming, 85%(Viva! 2021).","text",64
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","The cost of ballot initiatives varies widely. For example, in their report on the subject Rethink Priorities(Schukraft 2020)describes cases costing between $47,000 and $23 million USD, with cases in larger jurisdictions tending to cost more (but probably less per capita). Also notable is that even a failed campaign may generate public awareness of the issue and generate a debate on the subject(Schukraft 2020).","text",65
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Despite their great promise in converting public opinion into dramatic and sudden change, since there are only a limited number of countries and areas that allow ballot initiatives, ballot initiatives could not by themselves lead to victory for the animal advocacy movement. However, they could lead to local victories that could later spread to other areas. Switzerland is a well-respected country that is seen as a world leader in many areas. It is relatively small as well, which suggests that the investment needed to achieve this may be smaller. In this light, the work of Sentience Politics on ballot initiatives in Switzerland seems particularly valuable.","text",66
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Investment in the states that allow ballot initiatives may also be promising. In this case, there is the potential for other states to be influenced by the decision, and the potential for it to later be adopted at a federal level. This would require substantially more work, especially since the animal welfare standards of the United States are substantially weaker than the animal welfare standards of Switzerland(World Animal Protection n.d.), though the United States is perhaps the most culturally influential country, as well as being responsible for a great deal of animal farming and animal product consumption.","text",67
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Ballot initiatives seem very useful for getting a foothold to press for wider adoption, though it may well be that more work is required before more ambitious asks, such as ending factory farming, will be able to pass. The cost-effectiveness of ballot initiatives is not completely clear in most cases, but they should be considered, especially in areas where public support is particularly high, but politicians may be reluctant to move(Wrenn 2012).","text",68

Bryant and Barnett(2020)reviewed studies of consumer acceptance of cultured meat, finding that typically a majority are willing to at least try it and a substantial proportion are interested in consuming it on a regular basis. One pattern is that people typically see benefits as accruing to society, but risks accruing to themselves. Perhaps because of this, frames that highlighted both individual and societal benefits were most effective. This data is fairly encouraging, though it does suggest that a majority of the population would continue consuming animals and therefore that cultured meat has an important, but not decisive role to play. However, optimistically, if the price became lower than regular meat and its taste and convenience were similar, some of these people might become accustomed to the new technology and begin to eat it regularly.","text",104

Though the unnaturalness of the product was perceived as a significant downside to it, consumers were largely not receptive to arguments that cultured meat is in fact natural. They were more convinced by arguments for the benefits of the product. They found that the term “clean meat” led to significantly higher rates of acceptance, “lab grown meat” led to significantly lower rates of acceptance, and “cultured meat” led to rates of acceptance between these two(Bryant and Barnett 2018).","text",105
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Beyondtaste, price, and convenience,another framework for thinking about people’s stated reasons for consuming meat is the four Ns framework that eating meat isnatural, normal, necessary, and nice. Piazza et al.(2015)tested this theory, finding that an impressive 83% - 91% of rationalisation for eating meat fell into one of these four categories. Since these categories are moral justifications, people will be less likely to mention factors such as price and convenience, because these look trivial or even offensive when invoked to justify an immoral action. That people feel comfortable bringing up ‘niceness’ as a moral justification may be a testament to how small of a moral issue the consumption of animal products is regarded, since this would be viewed as unacceptable in the context of other moral issues(Piazza et al. 2015).","text",106

One of the experts we interviewed argued that many technologies have similar hurdles that must be overcome, and, since we have not solved these yet, they may look difficult to solve from where we are standing.

Some of these improvements have also brought plant-based meats molecularly closer to real meat, such as the plant-based heme content of Impossible Burgers, the core molecule in blood, which is an key ingredient for the distinctive flavour of meat(Choudhury et al. 2020).","text",111
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","However, even if plant-based meats can begin to compete on price and further improve flavour, people may have particular psychological and cultural associations with meat that may mean many will continue to eat regular meat. Meat is the centre of many cultural traditions involving food across the world. Being traditionally more expensive than other forms of food, it is also seen as a higher status form of consumption(Charles et al. 1988). Meat is also associated with masculinity and male virility, being seen as something that “real men” eat(Adams 2018; Loughnan, Bastian, and Haslam 2014).","text",112

"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","A recent survey asked people what they would consume if taste and price were equalised and it found that 30% would opt for “meat-like alternatives from plants” instead of “real meat from animals”(Bollard 2022b). Similarly, another survey asked people if they would choose regular meat or Beyond Meat if the two were equally priced. 27% said that they would choose Beyond Meat(Tonsor, Lusk, and Schroeder 2022; Bollard 2022b). Surveys like this should be interpreted with care because they ask consumers to predict how they would act in hypothetical situations. More compellingly, a study in a UCLA dining hall where consumers did not have to pay extra for the Impossible Burger found that 11-26% opted for it over the meat option when it was heavily promoted based on environmental benefits(Bollard 2022a; Malan 2020). More pessimistically, an analysis by Lusk et al.(2021)suggests that for each 10% reduction in price for plant-based beef products, there would be only a 0.15% reduction in US cattle production, in a slightly lower decline in global cattle production.","text",114

It is possible that a higher consumption of alternative proteins would mean that fewer people are resistant to reductions of the size of animal agriculture in the future. Considering this along with current low intake of plant-based animal products suggests that plant-based meat will play a supporting role at best in the victory of the animal advocacy movement.","text",115

"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Even if the industry does not manage to avoid “the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order to eat the breast or wing”, future technology may still offer us a pathway to avoid at least the worst suffering of these animals(Smithsonian Magazine and Eschner 2017). Shriver(2009)proposes that this may be done through making “knockout animals”. That is, animals who have a gene involved in pain perception are knocked out, meaning that they do not experience the affective dimension of pain and therefore do not ‘mind’ the experience. Morphine has a similar effect in removing the affective component of pain experience, and pain blunted by morphine is typically regarded as morally unproblematic, though it is difficult to be sure that the same holds true for animals, who are unable to share details of their experience with us(Shriver 2009). Shriver argues that because the sensory component of pain would be retained, some protective behaviour would remain, which could allow the animals to avoid some of the injuries that they might otherwise experience, and so making the raising of these animals potentially economically feasible.","text",117
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Utilitarians should probably view this scenario as not inherently ethically problematic on the face of it. Deontologists might object to the use of animals as property or as “mere means”. Still, all plausible moral theories take consequences (especially suffering) into consideration in some respect and it would be hard to object that this scenario is not greatly preferable to the status quo(Shriver 2009).","text",118
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Moral common sense might regard it as unnatural and as a perversion of the animal nature or of the dignity of the animals(Schultz-Bergin 2017). However, these are already greatly violated by the status quo that uses them for their flesh and causes them to grow unnatural proportions, in conditions that do not allow them to express their natures. Knocking out the genes responsible for pain would largely just be removing the suffering associated with this(Shriver 2009). Additionally, the idea of ‘naturalness’ is hard to define and it is hard to justify and reflectively endorse the moral importance commonly assigned to this term(Shriver and McConnachie 2018). Concern for “naturalness” here may simply reduce down to status quo bias and disgust, which are difficult to give moral justifications for.","text",119
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","There are also genetic modifications that could be made to livestock short of the complete knockout of pain genes. These include modifying cows so that they are born without horns and therefore do not need to go through the painful process of dehorning and modifying chickens so that they are born with softer beaks that therefore are less damaging to other chickens during feather pecking. Some of these may come with welfare costs, for example if they prevent the animals from engaging in actions that they find naturally rewarding, though in the cases described above, given that horns and large portions of beaks are already regularly removed, the effect of the modification would largely just be to remove the great pain associated with these procedures. Having said this, one could reasonably argue that it is beneficial for the industry to solve these welfare issues in better ways that treat the underlying issues such as crowding, rather than modifying animals to fit terrible conditions in ways that reduce their welfare. These modifications would not reduce suffering as dramatically as knocking out pain genes, but they might still have a role to play(Shriver and McConnachie 2018). They could perhaps serve as stepping stones for the implementation of the knocking out of the pain genes, though it is unclear if they would be dramatically harder to implement than the knocking out of the pain genes.","text",120
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Our most significant remaining worry with the knockout animals pathway is that a knockout of this gene might not remove the negative valence of psychological states that they are likely to experience in factory farm conditions such as fear, distress, and boredom. If this could not be done then this would not represent an appealing ideal or endgame, because this could still represent a huge amount of suffering. Moreover, the lack of ability to experience physical suffering might give farmers the moral licence to treat them much worse, increasing the amount of psychological suffering(Wilkinson 2009). Though this cannot be ruled out, it appears as though the underlying circuitry is shared between mental and physical suffering, suggesting that knockout animals would not experience mental suffering. Though this is still not certain and some circuits, such as depression, may use different pathways (interview proceedings). One experimental data point that knockout animals wouldnotfeel psychological pain is shown in this passage: “Interestingly, studies have shown that that ablation of the anterior cingulate causes mother mammals to stop responding to the cries of their young, leading some researchers to suggest that the “neural alarm” system that underlies parental response was built off of the machinery for pain”(Eisenberger, Lieberman, and Williams 2003; Shriver 2009).","text",121
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","A survey of 211 members of the general public found that more people opposed the use of knockout animals in experiments than supported it(Gardner and Goldberg 2007). The sample was largely composed of research scientists and vegetarians and/or members of the animal advocacy community (vegan was not included as an option). The first question that they were asked was ""[t]he technology now exists to create mice that are genetically engineered to feel no pain. Should these animals be created for the purposes of biological research?"" Overall, 31.6% strongly disagreed that they should be created, 16.5% disagreed, 14.9% strongly agreed, and 25.5% agreed, with the rest being undecided. From the animal advocacy community this level of disagreement was even higher, with 58.7% strongly disagreeing or 72% for animal advocates who were also vegetarian. This level of disagreement may mean that the prospect is a non-starter, since even the would be advocates of this idea are opposed.","text",122
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Though to our knowledge the gene editing technology has not yet been applied to farmed animals, Wei et al.(2002)successfully developed the technology in mice. We are not aware of any special challenges involved in adopting the techniques for farmed animals, and so this technology is probably more readily accessible than cultured meat. Having said this, because of the strong criticism and disfavour from even allies of animals, we think this path to victory is unlikely. There is also uncertainty about whether this really makes the kind of physical pain these animals experience essentially morally unproblematic and significant uncertainty about if it would remove all mental suffering. This probably mixes pathways to risky until these questions are answered. It may still be an improvement of the status quo, but we cannot now be sure that it represents victory.","text",123

An example of how this could happen is if the pace of welfare reforms continues until it reaches a point where most people, without further moral advocacy, view the conditions as acceptable even when they are made conscious of them. This scenario could happen if welfare reforms inspired momentum in the short term, but this did not translate into long term momentum.","text",135

This rising concern for animals is suggested from its increasing appearance and legislation in countries such as the UK and from the increasing attention to it in at least academic moral discourse(Broom 2011). It can also be seen from the book Animal Machines(Harrison 2013), first published in 1964, which described the huge ethical issue of factory farming as it was unfolding. This concern therefore does not seem to have protected animals from the horrors of factory farming, and perhaps the higher level of concern for animals seen in modern times would not protect us from some new horror in our treatment of animals if it became economically profitable to do so.","text",136
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","One potential candidate for this worsening of conditions is the farming of insects. Insect farming has been heralded as an environmentally friendly form of protein, with animal welfare issues infrequently discussed, however, because insects have such small body sizes, huge numbers of them need to be raised and killed to produce the same amount of meat. It is unclear if they are sentient because of the difficulty of assessing this in animals with minds much different from our own, but there are some surprisingly strong indications of sentience in them, which cannot be dismissed(Schukraft 2019).","text",137
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Some argue that insects would not mind the conditions because they have small and simpler minds, and so are easy to satisfy.  However, they are likely to be raised in extremely intensive conditions, with extremely little research on their welfare in different conditions. Additionally, there is already extreme neglect of the welfare of farmed animals, and in the case of insects this will probably be total neglect of their welfare. There are no animal welfare laws concerning the treatment of them(Rowe 2020; Carpendale 2019). But most concerningly, the massive numbers of insects suggest that the rise of farming them could represent a new era of factory farming, despite concern for animals being at perhaps an all-time high.","text",138

"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","An important and central debate in advocacy is between abolitionism and another perspective that has been called “welfarism”, “new welfarism”, or “animal protectionism”. In our research for this report, we found this debate particularly relevant as a crucial consideration. In particular, we thought that if abolitionism were true, it would have large implications for this report. Though, like most staff at animal advocacy organisations, we came in with greater sympathy for animal protectionism, we have attempted to keep an open mind in our consideration of the arguments and evidence.","text",140
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","The terms welfarism or new welfarism are the terms generally used by abolitionists such as Francione, but defenders of that position, such as Garner prefer a more neutral term that does not suggest that they are aligned with animal welfare science – which they see as too close to the industry – or imply a focus of welfare rather than rights(Francione and Garner 2010). We will use the term “animal protectionism” in this post, so as not to beg the question against their position by assuming those things through our terminology.","text",141
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","The abolitionist approach is characterised by rejection of what it regards as piecemeal welfare campaigns and single-issue campaigns, in favour of a clearer, hard-line rejection of the use of all sentient animals. Abolitionists argue that these single-issue campaigns are misguided and are perhaps actively harmful because they reinforce the message that other forms of animal exploitation not touched by them are morally acceptable. Some abolitionists would also argue that a campaign against the wearing of fur is also misguided because it does not mention leather or other forms of animal exploitation and therefore suggests that fur is problematic, but these other products are not(Francione and Garner 2010).","text",142
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Animal protectionism is normally defined in contrast with abolitionism. So-called animal protectionists may or may not agree with abolitionist goals of ending animal farming and all other use of animals, but they at least agree that incremental improvements in the conditions of animals are both morally valuable in themselves and strategically valuable. They view their position as more pragmatic in accepting an incremental approach, rather than accepting nothing short of full veganism and animal liberation.","text",143
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","A strong abolitionist approach unfortunately leaves few animal advocacy approaches which are permissible. Francione suggests that we should be doing direct, no frills vegan outreach as individuals or as grassroots organisations, which does not allow the movement to experiment with a diversity of tactics and to push forward on multiple fronts. Unfortunately, the evidence base behind individual outreach so far suggests that is not an effective approach or at least not an approach that should be pursued to the exclusion of other approaches(Sentience Institute 2020; ACE 2013; Reese 2016).","text",144
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Francione suggests that the debate ultimately comes down to differing moral values, though some animal protectionists disagree that this is a significant factor as they also aim to end all animal exploitation(Vegan Debate Archive 2018; Francione and Garner 2010).

"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","To begin with, it is difficult to discuss welfare reforms in general in this way, since each welfare reform is different. In our work helping organisations prioritise amongst possible interventions for the next campaigns, we examine the expected welfare effects of different reforms using systematic research methods. As a result of this research, we are certainly sceptical of some reforms in certain contexts, and we believe some to have a neutral or negative impact on animals. We always encourage organisations to think more carefully and critically about which issues to campaign on and which welfare reforms to support.","text",149
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","However, many appear to have quite a large positive impact for animals, and Francione’s sweeping claim that none or essentially none of these reforms would constitute a meaningful reduction in suffering seems very implausible. In assessing his claims, we look through the chapter dedicated to this: The Empirical and Structural Defects of Animal Welfare Theory in Rain Without Thunder: The Ideology of the Animal Rights Movement(G. Francione 2010). We were unable to find adequate empirical sources cited in that chapter to back up these claims.","text",150
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Turning to other sources, we took a case for which we judged should be an easy case for Francione’s position if it were true and also a particularly important case given the large amount of investment in it. This is the case of cage free (aviary) systems for laying hens instead of cage systems. The Open Philanthropy Project was criticised by DxE who claim that cage free (aviary) systems for housing hens may actually be worse for hen welfare (as tracked chiefly by mortality rate). To make this claim, they just wrote thismemothat reviews the literature on the subject. In response, the Open Philanthropy Project wrote a report(“How Will Hen Welfare Be Impacted by the Transition to Cage-Free Housing?” 2017)arguing that they were no longer as confident in the previous claims, but they still believe that cage free systems were necessary to transition to even higher welfare systems and that an analysis of the strongest studies in the literature suggested that cage systems were higher welfare.","text",151
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Our assessment agrees with Open Philanthropy in this case, though we remain unsure. Another recent attempt to calculate the difference between the two systems by Welfare Footprint Project(Schuck-Paim and Alonso 2021)concluded that cage free is clearly superior, with most of the welfare difference coming from the deprivation of natural behaviours in caged systems. Given that this should have been an easy case of a marginal improvement for the abolitionist position, we take this as significant evidence against their thesis.","text",152
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Other cases are less ambiguous. For example, in many countries, farmed animals – especially fish in aquaculture – are not always stunned before slaughter. Though stunning is often inadequate with respect to its reliability in causing unconsciousness, it is difficult to argue that it is not beneficial for the animals compared to slaughter without stunning(Gregory 2005; AE UK n.d.; Jung-Schroers et al. 2020). Additionally, if it were thought that stunning was particularly unreliable, and therefore does not represent a meaningful welfare improvement, organisations could instead campaign to increase the reliability of the stunning process.","text",153
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Francione thinks that veal is not worse than dairy because each is just the use of animals(Vegan Debate Archive 2018). Full analyses of the question have found that beef involves much more suffering (and veal plausibly results in much more suffering than other forms of beef)(Ladak 2020; Tomasik 2007). The differences between these two cases seem like extremely relevant details for moral theory to pay attention to.","text",154
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Additionally, some single-issue campaigns, such as banning fur, do not involve welfare reforms as such, they involve removing animals, or whole groups of animals, from the production system entirely. This criticism therefore does not apply to those campaigns.","text",155

"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","The second major disagreement is on whether people will just substitute for lower welfare animal products. This, again, is always a concern that organisations should pay attention to when picking campaigns. This is particularly a concern when there is a risk for consumers to substitute for even lower welfare products, such as substituting for small animals. Our report ‘Meat Tax: Why Chickens Pay The Price’ represents a case where the risk of this appears to be high and so we recommend against intervention.","text",157
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Having said this, it is again a strong claim to say that substitution for lower welfare products will almost always happen. While meat is generally a somewhat inelastic product(Andreyeva, Long, and Brownell 2010), cross price elasticities differ based on products compared and geographical area, and this must be approached in a case-by-case way⁷. Note as well that even when some goods are substituted for each other, it is rare for products to be near perfect substitutes for each other. This means that while some substitution will take place, they will switch to the substitute product at significantly less than a one-to-one rate.","text",158
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Akaichi and Revoredo-Giha(2016)studied cross price elasticities between meats labelled as higher welfare, meats labelled as organic, and regular products in Scotland. They found that organic pork was a substitute for higher welfare meat and they found some amount of substitution between higher welfare meat and regular meat when the price of the former was raised. This is in the direction of Francione’s claim, but there was far from perfect substitution in each case, conflicting with Francione’s claim.","text",159
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Francione’s argument also does not appear to apply to legislative changes. For example, if all EU egg production becomes cage free, it is very unlikely that almost all consumption of eggs in the EU would shift to imported eggs from countries where this was still allowed. If import restrictions are also included in the welfare legislation, it becomes impossible for this to happen (at least within the law).","text",160

"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Factory farming took over from conventional animal farming because its industrialised system allowed it to produce animal products much more cheaply. This of course resulted in significantly more animal suffering as the animals were treated like cogs in a machine(Harrison 2013). In many cases, welfare reforms resemble a gradual return to conventional animal agriculture. For example, keeping animals with access to the outside, using animals that do not have genes that cause them to grow very quickly at the expense of their welfare, and not separating a mother dairy cow from their calves. Though there will be some increased profitability that comes from these reforms based on the increased health and well-being of the animals, this must be balanced against the much larger costs associated with moving away from the industrialised model.","text",163

"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","If the abolitionist position here were correct, the natural question would be why would animal agriculture resist welfare reforms in numerous ways if these reforms ultimately just reduced costs for them? Francione anticipates this response and argues that the industry would resist reforms like this out of a general principle to make it more difficult to interest groups like animal advocacy organisations to be able to influence them. The principle is that even if these programs are beneficial, future reforms may not be and so it is worthwhile to impose costs on interest groups trying to control their behaviour. However, Francione maintains that all or virtually all welfare reforms reduce costs or can be easily compensated by shifting prices to consumers, so if this were true, animal advocacy organisations would pose no threat to the meat industry, now or in the future. If most animal advocacy organisations just function as consultants to the meat industry (as Francione claims inFrancione and Garner [2010]), why would the meat industry have to fear further cost-saving suggestions? The industry also appears to spend a lot of time and energy resisting the campaigns of animal advocacy organisations and go to great lengths to belittle them publicly, it is implausible that they would do this just to preserve the principle that they should not be pushed around. Organisations do not usually strenuously resist the suggestion of their consultants.","text",172
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","In their communication with the meat industry, animal advocacy organisations will naturally stress potential cost savings to the industry⁸. Some welfare reforms may indeed represent cost savings, and when this is true, the organisations will naturally stress that in order to be most convincing. This may suggest to outside observers who are looking for this evidence, such as Francione, that this is all that is happening, but this does not mean that all welfare reforms will save the industry money.","text",173
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Francione also argues that because animal agriculture organisations are corporations, they will only adopt welfare reforms if it is profit maximising for them to do so, which he suggests indicates that he must be right(Francione and Garner 2010). This neglects that this interpretation of corporations needing to act in profit maximising ways is simplistic and not entirely correct(Stout 2015). It also neglects that the pressure from animal advocacy organisations during corporate campaigns can threaten to inflict larger costs on these organisations through reputational damage or disruption, so the welfare reform may indeed be much more costly than baseline, even if it becomes the least costly option for them given the pressure from the corporate campaign.","text",174

Momentum refers to the idea that welfare reforms and other single-issue campaigns wet people’s appetites for further reforms, therefore being beneficial to the long-term goal of victory.

For example, the UK is one of the best in the world at protecting animals, including some outright bans that Francione would support such as a ban on fur farming(World Animal Protection 2021).

"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","An underlying theme in the debate between welfarism and abolitionism is whether we should be pragmatic in our advocacy or if we should be uncompromising. The pragmatic approach has the promise of meeting people where they are, rather than where we wish they would be. It allows us to suggest targeted next steps for people, rather than repeating largely the same demands in each case. For example, it allows us to praise people in their steps to reduce animal consumption, even if they continue to fall short of full veganism. In this way it allows a stepwise approach to the solution of problems that may make them more achievable. Rather than asking people to make a leap to full abolitionism, we just ask them to keep taking the next step forward, which may be much more psychologically realistic.","text",187

"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","On the other hand, an uncompromising approach represents a stronger statement of these ideals. If someone is doing something widely regarded as greatly morally wrong, we would not normally reinforce them or praise them for doing something only very slightly less morally wrong.

There is some experimental support for this claim.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","At first glance, the efficacy of the door-in-face technique appears to support an abolitionist approach; however, in the case of Francione style abolitionism, the ask is always veganism, rather than a smaller ask afterwards. This evidence therefore does not support Francione style abolitionism, but it does support the use of some abolitionist asks amongst other tactics, as long as they are not presented as the only possible option.","text",192
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","A possible synthesis or compromise between the two positions is to accept and to some extent encourage steps forward by individuals and industry whilst at the same time making it clear that these are only marginal steps forward and that much more remains to be done(Reese 2018). Speculatively, the door-in-the-face technique in particular suggests that a “good cop, bad cop” dynamic, with different organisations in the movement playing these respective roles, may be effective.","text",193

"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Ultimately, some synthesis of the ideas of protectionism and abolitionism may be possible. It is possible to learn from the abolitionist message that we should frame welfare reforms more as only marginal improvements and express our more ambitious goals of ending animal exploitation while not opposing reforms or believing that they are necessarily distractions. We can also favour campaigns that send a stronger abolitionist message and frame them as such. This approach may still be closer to the protectionist position and may leave an abolitionist unsatisfied.","text",195

"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","The second main crucial consideration that we considered in our research for this report is whether views of moral progress as steady and even are accurate or if it is substantially regressive at times and irregular.","text",197
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","The metaphor of an expanding moral circle was popularised by Peter Singer and widely used in the effective altruism community to refer to the idea that our moral consideration for other beings can be represented as a circle and that this circle can be expected to extend further, steadily and evenly(Singer 1981). This metaphor of a circle suggests any effort to expand the moral circle to a new group of beings will also help to extend it to another group of beings further out in terms of potential moral consideration. The thought behind this consistent and perhaps steady progress is that essentially the same moral principles apply in each case.","text",198
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","To what extent this more optimistic view is correct is a crucial consideration because it suggests how inevitable we can expect moral progress to be. If it is wrong, we could expect to see significant regressions or irregular progress. If it is correct, it also suggests that fundamental rights approaches may be more promising. This is because the more principles-based picture in moral psychology is that it assumes people will be more receptive to the arguments for fundamental rights and, further, that it will be easier to argue to extend those rights to other beings.","text",199
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","However, this picture assumes a certain consistency and reliance on principles that are perhaps not as common amongst most people. Based on this, an opposing hypothesis is that progress will be inconsistent and so progress to extend the moral circle in one case will not necessarily apply to another case. Rather than a moral circle we might have a moral polygon or a much less symmetrical and even shape. Concern for animals may then be a fragile meme, not an inevitable one.","text",200
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Jesse Clifton(2016)suggests that the history of human concern and protection for animals has been uneven and unprincipled. One example of this is that in 675, the Buddhist Emperor of Japan, Tenmu, banned the consumption of all domestic animals from April 1 to September 30 each year(Watanabe 1854; Bunko, n.d.), yet this was quickly abandoned in the Meiji restoration and today the animal welfare standards of Japan lag behind similarly wealthy countries in the West. If concern for animals was the result of a consistent and steady march forward, we might expect that Japan would be far ahead of other countries by this point in virtually all animal-rights issues, and perhaps a significant exporter of various animal advocacy ideas.","text",201
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Another case Clifton discusses is that of India which has long had high rates of vegetarianism and some significant concern for animals, as seen in its religious traditions. Nevertheless, rates of meat consumption in India are increasing rapidly, full veganism is still rare, and animal protection in India is still dominated by protection of cows rooted in Hinduism, with other forms of animal advocacy not seeing as much uptake as might have been expected(Devi et al. 2014).","text",202
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","A counterargument to these conclusions is that religious prohibitions may work differently from arguments based on the interests of the animals themselves. Religious arguments may be followed without significant agreement with any moral principles that a secular animal ethics might present. This is especially in the case of the Japanese Emperor since the restrictions that were imposed arbitrarily excluded wild animals and allowed meat consumption in part of the year, in addition to being handed down from above. These cases may therefore not represent strong evidence. Still, since a change in attitude can follow from a change in action(Bastian et al. 2012), we might still expect significant change from a prohibition that started this early. For example, it appears to be the case that many people who become vegan for health reasons later go on to consider veganism to be important for animal welfare reasons(Leenaert 2017).","text",203
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","There are also many arbitrary exceptions in the West suggesting a less than perfect moral circle. For example, chickens are not covered by animal protection laws in the United States. Similarly, farmed fish in the UK are not protected by any of the more detailed legislation that applies to other farmed animals and wild caught fish are not protected by even the basic protections of the Animal Welfare Act 2006(DEFRA 2006; Collinson 2018).","text",204
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","There are also the obvious cases that should be familiar to any animal advocate. Animals who are commonly kept as pets, such as cats and dogs, are treated as far more morally significant than other animals. Though some might argue that our special relationships with these animals justify our greater moral concern for them, it is difficult to justify the vast difference in our treatment of these animals compared with our treatment of other animals. This then seems like a clear case of an uneven moral expansion.","text",205
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Of course, even if moral expansion is far from even and inevitable, the general pattern where moral expansion towards one group of beings generally results in moral expansion towards other groups may still hold. This is the view that we find most plausible, though we are highly uncertain.","text",206

"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","As discussed, in addition to the end of animal agriculture, many voices call for more ambitious goals. Though the contribution of our current actions towards these goals is more speculative, it is worth considering their potential influence.","text",208
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","One more ambitious goal to help animals more robustly is presented in Zoopolis(Donaldson and Kymlicka 2011). In this book, Donaldson and Kymlicka argue for the inclusion of animals into our political system. This would include giving domestic animals the rights of citizens, wilderness (wild) animals the rights of nationals of their own states, and liminal animals (urban animals or others that live around us but independently) rights that lie somewhere between wild and domestic animals. Note that they claim that citizenship does not entail all of the same rights in every case, so domestic animals would not be given the right to vote, for example. They argue that the system better represents the neglected importance obligations stemming from the various kinds of relationships between humans and animals, as well as having practical benefits that other moral positions could appreciate.","text",209
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","There are other proposals for the political inclusion of animals. Janneke Vink argues in The Open Society and its Animals(Vink 2020)that animals should be included in liberal democracies, and that a failure to include them represents a threat to the democratic credentials, and possibly inclines them toward sliding into authoritarianism. Vink argues that this inclusion should at a minimum include the right to life, the right not to be tortured, and the right to bodily integrity. This book represents a statement of how society would ideally be structured with respect to animals, but it does not offer a roadmap of how to get there.","text",210
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","David Pearce(2015)imagines a welfare state for wild elephants which could serve as a template for a larger programme of helping animals in the wild. He imagines that the elephants could live in the wild, but with access to some assistance such as healthcare, emergency food relief, protection from poachers, orthodontics to extend their lifespan, and help during natural disasters and crises.","text",211
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","This style of intervention would be extremely expensive to implement on a wide scale, but if human wealth increases dramatically, interventions like this could be done and expanded to many other animals. Significant research is also required to help ensure more of the flow through effects of our actions are understood and accounted for. It is plausible that current actions to help farmed animals would also increase people’s willingness to help animals in the wild, therefore increasing the likelihood that this would be done. The scale of animals who could be helped in the wild also dwarfs the scale of animals killed for human consumption. This is in addition to the many wild animals we could abstain from harming if we took their interests into account(Animal Ethics n.d.).","text",212
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Looking still further into the future, some call for the inclusion of digital minds into our moral community(Gunkel 2018; Harris 2021). They argue that it is reasonably likely that such minds will be created and that when they are created, they are likely to be conscious.  Moreover, they argue that our actions to extend the moral circle to animals could extend to moral consideration for these digital minds in the future.","text",213
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","These scenarios represent more ways in which we can reduce the suffering of other animals or beings beyond ending factory farming. Though this would be a monumental step, there is more work to be done. The relationship between these scenarios and our current efforts to help farmed animals is less clear, but it is worth considering in order to maximise the flow-through effects of our actions.","text",214
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","There are some ways that current advocacy efforts can more strongly contribute to better outcomes in these scenarios. One is that we can share that our moral ideals extend well past ending factory farming and personal consumption. One way of doing this is with anti-speciesist messaging, rather than vegan messaging,","text",215
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Anti-speciesist messaging involved stressing the moral equality of humans and nonhuman animals, rather than a predominant focus on a particular (important) aspect of this, such as dietary choice in the case of veganism. Anti-speciesism implies not only refraining from harming animals, but also actively helping them, as we would humans in similar situations. It therefore makes intuitive sense that if we were able to spread it effectively, it would contribute more strongly to these after animal farming scenarios. Though this is only one of a variety of trade-offs between those two approaches that must be considered.","text",216

"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","This report covers a wide range of subjects in a fairly shallow manner. A report on the subject could have gone into much greater depth, as well as covering subjects that we do not touch. In addition, it is difficult to make predictions and extract general principles for animal advocates based on the evidence we have reviewed. As such, these conclusions should be treated as tentative and preliminary. We can imagine others looking at the same evidence and drawing substantially different conclusions.","text",218
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Though the strongest versions of abolitionism, such as the version argued for by Francione, are not well supported, there are some kernels of truth behind them that are useful for advocates to learn.","text",219
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Constructive criticism by abolitionists of the rest of the movement is helpful, but denigrations of the rest of the movement, such as accusations that they are now only a wing of the animal agriculture industry, are unhelpful. Opposing welfare reforms is also unmotivated and counterproductive.","text",220
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Specific abolitionist campaigns likely have a role to play in victory. These campaigns do have the advantage that they send a stronger and clearer moral message and their more ambitious, moonshot, nature can be appropriate in some cases, especially once concern for animals and the Overton window of the moral treatment of our issue of them has been shifted considerably in their favour.","text",221
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","When possible, other campaigns can also be framed in more abolitionist ways. The key way that this can be done is by presenting incremental progress as only one step along the pathway to victory, rather than now representing a morally acceptable situation.","text",222
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Having said this, there is also room for other organisations that work more closely with the industry, and do not include abolitionist messaging such as this. This should just not be taken too far into a defence of current industry practices against improvements. Though we understand that may also be difficult for organisations to sculpt an ideal message when people cannot be counted on to read full posts or articles by the organisation and when news coverage of their work may drop nuance.","text",223
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Turning to victory scenarios, no single pathway seems to have a much greater likelihood of resulting in victory than any other. We therefore do not recommend a majority focus on any single pathway. Instead, we see strength in pursuing a diversity of approaches. This is particularly true when these approaches are pursued with an experimental spirit, with thorough use of appropriate measurement and evaluation.","text",224
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","This does not mean that we should be investing equally in all approaches. Some such as corporate campaigns certainly deserve more investment than other approaches, but we should be wary that too much of the movement’s resources do not go into this approach at the neglect of other approaches. Though some approaches, such as leafleting, that have evidence that they are not effective in contributing towards victory or having substantial direct effects should continue to be neglected by the movement. Having said this, the overall evidence base and the movement is not strong and some more research on these approaches would still be valuable; charities with a strong focus on measurement and evaluation could still usefully try these approaches as experiments.","text",225
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","This also does not mean that individual organisations should pursue a variety of different programs. This may already be too common in the animal advocacy community considering that there are gains to be made through specialisation.","text",226
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","Cultured meat was widely regarded by the movement as the most likely pathway to victory, but recent evaluation from outside the industry has been far less sanguine. Still, if those technological barriers can be overcome, cultured meat offers a more straightforward pathway to victory than many of the other approaches. Another form of alternative or plant-based protein could also take the place of cultured meat.","text",227
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","With a subject this speculative and with such breadth, we naturally have many remaining uncertainties. The subject touches on and depends on most questions within animal advocacy. There is much more that we could have examined in more depth included in the report that could have changed the conclusions substantially. There were many crucial considerations that we encountered that we did not fully examine and discuss⁹. One particularly important thing that we could have done would have been to analyse cultured meat in a more technical way, such as by analysing Humbird(2020)more rigorously.","text",228
"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture","We understand that more general conclusions such as these are less action guiding than more specific and confident conclusions. There is also a risk that animal advocacy organisations rationalise their current actions as meeting these standards, when in fact more reflection and self-scepticism is needed.

Inelastic products are products for which consumer buying decisions are not strongly influenced by price and so increase in price does cause correspondingly large decrease in demand (Kenton 2021). Cross price elasticity refers to the effect that a change in the price of one product has on demand for a second product. If demand for the second product increases when the price of the first product increases, they are known as substitute goods. If the converse happens and demand for the second product decreases when the price of the first product increases, they are known as complementary goods (Hayes 2022).","text",237

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","In this report, we ask whether the animal advocacy movement should invest more resources into formingparty groupsfocused on animal welfare. For context, we usually encourage animal advocacy organisations to pursue legislative lobbying in general, and there are guides offering advice on how to conduct legislative lobbying for animal advocacy(1,2).","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","In this report, we focus specifically on party groups. Party groups are informal groups of MPs focused on a particular policy area. Party groups on various topics exist in many legislatures around the world. Party groups are a way to influence animal welfare policy through existing parties. Party groups may influence policy in a number of ways, such as: policy advocacy, in which groups can concretely affect specific details of policy proposals; information exchange, in which groups can provide information to politicians through reports and events; and agenda setting, in which groups make a particular topic more salient in a legislature or in the media. Academic studies show that party groups often have a policy impact. There are two main types of these groups:","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","All-party groups (APGs), which draw their membership from across multiple parties in a legislature. The European Parliament's Animal Welfare Intergroup is an example of an APG.","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","Sub-party groups (SPGs), which exist inside a single party. The UK's Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation is an example of an SPG.","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","We do not recommend that the movement invests huge resources into systematically launching party groups around the world. That said, we do believe that party groups are one promising tool among the many available in the legislative lobbying toolbox. While party groups are relatively cheap to run, the policy wins that tend to be obtained by party groups don't seem hugely different from what standard legislative lobbying would achieve. We also emphasise that successfully running a party group is a long-term investment—running a party group requires patience, political acumen, great communication skills, and (for sub-party groups) actively participating in the broader scene of the target political party.","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","We also identify the countries where there are not yet animal advocacy party groups. In a 2013 publication, Ringe et al conducted a close examination of party groups in 45 of the world's advanced industrial democracies. That study found that of these 45 countries, 25 have some form of party group system. There are 17 countries that already have animal welfare party groups. Therefore, the following countries do not yet appear to have animal welfare party groups in their national legislatures: India, South Africa, Sweden, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, New Zealand, Norway. This is also true for the subnational legislatures in India's states, South Africa's provinces, Germany's states, Indonesia's provinces, plus some states in the USA and some states and territories in Australia. These jurisdictions would be the most promising opportunities for launching new party groups focused on animal advocacy.","text",17

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","In many democratic legislatures, it is possible to establish informal groups focused on a particular policy area. In this approach, we examine the possibility of establishing groups like these to encourage existing political parties to focus on animal welfare policy.","text",32
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","There are two main types of these groups. Both of these types are part of the umbrella categoryparty groups, which are also called legislative member organisations.","text",33
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","APG: Anall-party groupis any voluntary, informal body of legislators across more than one party who share a common interest in a policy area. APGs are also called cross-party groups, intergroups, and interparty caucuses. An example of an APG is the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare (UK).","text",34
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","SPG: Asub-party groupis any voluntary, informal body of legislators within asingleparty who share a common ideological position or interest in a policy area. SPGs are also called factions or intraparty caucuses.","text",35
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","Party groups are sometimes closely associated with outside actors, such as charities and NGOs. The boundary between party groups and NGOs is often fuzzy.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","Party groups are a way to influence animal welfare policy through existing parties. Typically, the parties involved are the biggest and most influential parties in a country, such as the parties that usually form government.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","Policy advocacy. Groups can concretely affect the details of policy proposals. This can occur over the short-term (e.g. influencing details of particular pieces of legislation) or long-term (e.g. building coalitions to support animal welfare reforms over time). For example, there are instances where the APGs have caused specific passages to be inserted into the text of legislation(3).","text",40
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","Information exchange. Groups can provide information to politicians, encouraging politicians to either propose, support, or oppose a particular policy.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","3. Policy Impact of Groups","text",44
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","How often do party groups actually influence policy? The weight of evidence does indicate that party groups can have a policy impact that is positive, if modest. This section describes the academic evidence on the policy impact of party groups in general; we turn to the more specific case of party groups for animal advocacy below (see section ""Costs and Impacts for Party Groups in Animal Advocacy"").","text",45
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","Firstly, there are three seminal academic studies on party groups.","text",46
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","Thomas(4)studies APGs in Canada, Scotland, Ontario, and the UK. The groups are usually supported by outside actors (e.g. businesses, charities, NGOs) that often provide funding, staff, services, and other resources. External actors often create and support APGs as part of broader lobbying campaigns while acknowledging that APGs are not always the most effective way to achieve their goals. Notably, Thomas finds that these groups can help legislators obtain information and can influence policy. Professional lobbying consultants regard APGs as often less effective than other lobbying tools.","text",47
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","The book by Ringe et al(3)gives a general study of party groups (both APGs and SPGs) in legislatures around the world. From a sample of 45 democratic countries, the authors find that party groups exist in 25 countries. The authors argue that the main role of party groups is to build social networks between legislators, which in turn allows for greater information sharing for all members of a network. This information includes technical details about and impacts of policies, but also the preferences of other parliamentarians, their constituents, whether a policy can be challenged in court, and so on. Ringe et al demonstrate that there are cases where party groups in the European Parliament have definitely influenced the content of legislation, at times even drafting text and having parliamentarians successfully insert that text into legislation via amendments(3). Party groups appear most likely to affect legislation in the agenda-setting stage or early consideration and drafting stages. The voluntary nature of party groups means they are very diverse in how they run and operate - this also means that groups will vary in their level of policy impact.","text",48
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","The book by Hammond(5), is a comprehensive study of party groups (both APGs and SPGs) in national policymaking in the US. Hammond argues that party groups are an informal adaptation that allow legislators to deal with the increasing complexity of policy issues and greater contact with constituents and interest groups. Hammond argues that party groups can indeed shape the legislative agenda and influence policy.","text",49
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","Building on the above seminal studies, there are also a few empirical studies that are worth mentioning:","text",50
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","McGee(6)examine intraparty caucuses in the US. Intraparty caucuses are one type of SPG, but they tend to be large and have broad policy agendas. The results are highly specific to the context of the US House of Representatives - the author repeatedly emphasises how the results are affected by the majoritarian legislature, political polarisation, the concentration of power in the hands of each party's elite, and the specific nature of the Republican and Democrat parties. So, it is unclear whether these results will generalise to animal welfare party groups in other jurisdictions. Drawing on interviews and more than 15,000 policy documents, McGee shows that SPGs in the US House ""provide a vital avenue for rank-and-file members to extract policy concessions from party leaders in a highly centralised power structure"". Influencing legislation throughout the legislative process, with interview respondents emphasising that ""earlier is better"", even though closed-door informal negotiations cannot be measured.","text",51
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","Clarke et al(7)test whether SPGs in the US enable legislators to advance their policy proposals more effectively. The authors find that SPGs can affect legislation in some situations. Specifically, they ""find robust evidence that factions in the minority party – and only the minority party – improve their members’ ability to advance their policy proposals. Such effects are large and extend even to the passage of high-profile substantive and significant legislation."" The authors find no such evidence for factions in the majority party, concluding that in a majority (governing) party, the party leaders have comparatively more power over the party members.","text",52
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","Zelizer(8–10)analyses ""the causal effect of information on legislators’ policy positions"". Zelizer uses field experiments in a US state legislature to test the influence of three types of information that are highly relevant to APGs: staff briefings, cue-taking, and group deliberation. Staff briefing ""increased cosponsorship by 60% above baseline rates"", and negative briefing reduced cosponsorship and voting support of bills. Taking cues from other legislators ""is nearly 80% as effective as direct briefings"". Deliberations within party groups ""increased both cosponsorship and roll call voting support"" and also reduces polarisation on a bill.","text",53
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","Subsequently, Zelizer(11)found that this additional support may carry over to similar bills introduced in the future, though this appeared to be limited to closely related bills (rather than all bills relating to a broad issue). Zelizer concludes with a view that is optimistic, if modest, about the effects of information on legislators' policy positions: ""Persuasion was robust when legislators were provided technical expertise about bills; it lasted for years and crossed over to bills with related content. Legislators did not respond to a meeting with a special interest by simply supporting all of their bills, nor to a poll of constituents by persistently changing their voting behaviour. This suggests that legislators are trying to learn about the content of proposals, recall what they are given, and rely on this information when deciding what position to take. It is a relatively sanguine view of legislative persuasion.""","text",54
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","Camp et al(12)also use field experiments to test whether providing information to legislators changes those legislators' policy positions. The results show that information changes legislators' positions when provided by legislative staffers, but not by lobbyists. The authors conclude that legislators are cautious when provided information by lobbyists, though it is also possible that the findings are attributable to the experimental design. For our purposes, it may be important to present and frame information in a way that appears trustworthy and appears buy-in from legislators, and repeated interactions through a party group is one way to accomplish this.","text",55
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","It is also worth reporting the following passage. This excerpt was written in an email by an animal advocate running a CPG and also conducting more traditional forms of lobbying. They write that party groups ""are quite a lot of work to organise and maintain, and return on investment (in terms of policy influence and impact) is limited. They can be useful for relationship building and establishing the name and profile of the organisation that coordinates the group, but their effectiveness as a vehicle for policy change is limited. I think this is partly due to their bipartisan make up which can limit the types of issues the group is willing to engage on. That said, they can certainly still add value. Politicians love physical events and forums because they are more tangible and they can engage on a personal level. You could hold a physical event that attracts 30 people and it would have more impact on a politician than an online event that attracts 300. However, that needs to be balanced against the additional time and resources required for the physical event.""","text",56
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","4. Where Could New Groups Be Established?","text",57
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","Are there countries where animal welfare groups don't already exist and could be established? In the table below, we divide the world's democratic countries into countries thatdo nothave an animal welfare APG in their legislatures and countries thatdohave an animal welfare APG in their legislatures. We also list countries we are unsure about and countries that do not have any APGs.","text",58

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","In this section, we analyse the financial costs and policy impacts of some existing, successful party groups in animal advocacy. Our overall conclusions are as follows. Firstly, party groups seem relatively cheap to run. Secondly, the policy wins—while often meaningful and high-impact—don't seem hugely different from what could be achieved by other approaches to legislative lobbying. These findings fit with the view that party groups appear to be one tool among the many available to legislative lobbying organisations.","text",65

Landorff reported in the 2010s that the Intergroup's official membership consisted of 44 MEPs, who came from six different political party alliances and six member states(16). The Intergroup has rules for membership and participation that are quite formal and comprehensive compared to other Intergroups in the European Parliament(16). The Intergroup hosts monthly meetings. Not all MEPs who are members of the Intergroup attend, though external guests and MEPs' assistants do attend also. Meetings typically have two speakers. It is striking for our purposes that one of these two speakers is almost always a representative of Eurogroup for Animals or other animal advocacy organisations(16).

However, it still provides a useful sample for understanding the Intergroup's impact over a particular time period, which can give us an idea of a party group's impact per year. The major policies attributed to the Intergroup, as of 2013, are as follows(3,15,17): a ban on the trade in seal products; amendments on animal experimentation; the withdrawal of subsidies for long-distance animal transport; and a ban on cat and dog fur. The Intergroup also successfully had animals classified as ""sentient beings"", rather than products, in the Lisbon Treaty.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","The Intergroup obtained a ban on the sale and import into the EU of seal products(3,15,17). This was enacted in 2009 by the Regulation No 1007/2009 on the Trade in Seal Products. Prior to the Regulation, the EU was an important market for seal products, with products coming from hunts of wild seals in Canada, Greenland, and a few other places. Seals are typically killed at below 3 months of age(19). The welfare impacts of the seal harvest are described in detail by Butterworth and Richardson(19). This scientific review found that the hunt, during which seals experience considerable distress, ""compares extremely unfavourably with the societal and legal expectations for commercial slaughter conditions"".","text",77

The average seal harvest pre-2009, summed across both Canada(20)and Greenland(21), was 464,788 seals. The average seal harvest post-2009 was 210,210 seals.

We assume that the 2009 Regulation is entirely attributable to the activity of the Intergroup. This assumption is based on interviews from MEPs reporting as such(3), though it is possible that a similar policy would have passed even without the activity of the Intergroup. Our estimate only accounts for the seal harvest in Canada and Greenland, the two places where almost all of the harvest happens, though there are comparatively small harvests in Namibia, Russia, Norway(22).","text",79

The REACH legislation was a new regulatory regime for chemicals sold in the EU. As part of the REACH's requirements, companies were obligated to perform new tests to evaluate the safety of chemicals.

One MEP interviewed by Ringe et al(3)reported that they were ""100 percent sure that [...] that was the intergroup"". Before these subsidies were abolished, businesses were paid, for each cow, the difference between the price of cows in the EU and the price of cows in the importing country. Data of EU's cow exports don't really show a clear break before and after 2013(25). The EU's live cow exports would have been affected by other political and policy changes happening around the same time (e.g. accession of countries). As a conservative assumption, we will assume that this policy had no impact on the number of cows exported live from the EU. In reality, we expect that this policy would indeed have had a meaningful impact, perhaps affecting a proportion of the ~500 to 600 thousand cattle exported live each year around 2013. Due to data limitations, and the fact that the scale of this policy would be relatively small compared to the other four policies we do model, we are comfortable ignoring this impact purely for the purpose of this report.","text",94

"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","The Intergroup obtained a ban on the sale and import into the EU of cat and dog fur. This ban was applied from 31 Dec 2008(26), though a voluntary ban had already been in place since 2002(27). The problem facing policymakers was that some products nevertheless used cat and dog fur either unlabelled or mislabelled, with the main products being ""jackets and coats, scarves, neckerchiefs, key rings and skin""(26). As part of the 2008 ban, the European Commission and some Member States provided resources for officials to use in identifying cat and dog fur. There are two main reasons we exclude this policy from our analysis. Firstly, the scale of the ban was quite small. For example, in 2010, Member States report that 67 consignments were seized at the border, and 40 consignments were seized in shops and retailers(26). Member States expressed concern that it was difficult to enforce the ban for products purchased from online retailers. Secondly, the ban was placed on fur produced from cats and dogs, but not from other animals. It is unclear if this ban would actually have caused fewer animals to be farmed for their fur. Rather, it is possible that cat and dog fur products banned from the EU were simply sold to other countries instead, or that consumers and manufacturers simply switched to fur produced from other animal species - this latter possibility is concerning, as farming smaller animals (e.g. rabbits) may mean that more animals were farmed to produce a particular quantity of fur. The European Fur Breeders Association reported that ""the ban did not have a negative impact on fur trade""(26). Subsequent analysis showed that cat fur products were still being sold in the EU in 2017(28). We suspect that a detailed analysis on this policy would reveal that the benefits for animals would have been small.","text",96

The CAWF heavily campaigned for this policy and was publicly attributed by politicians as having made an important contribution(35,36). The policy was included in the Kept Animals Bill, though this Bill was subsequently dropped. The government has stated that they will be ""taking forward measures in the Kept Animals Bill individually during the remainder of this parliament,"" though it remains to be seen whether this promise materialises(37).","text",110
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","In aprevious report, we analysed the impact of banning live export(38). We concluded that this policy probably reduces a meaningful amount of suffering, but only for a small number of animals and only for a small proportion of their lives. Based on older 2016 data, the UK exports roughly 550,000 live animals to the EU each year(39). This excludes chickens. Exports to the EU account for about two-thirds of the UK's total live exports by value(39), so we could expect the total number of animals exported live by the UK to be around 800,000 per year. These figures are from before Brexit and could have changed since the UK left the EU. Live export numbers have decreased substantially over time(40). In more recent years, between 25,000 and 50,000 sheep and calves have been exported from Great Britain annually(41). It is unclear how much of this decrease is due to conscious policy change and how much is due to temporary administrative barriers resulting from post-Brexit trade negotiations. Live export numbers have decreased over time in other countries (e.g. Australia(38)). However, there is nothing to prevent the live exports numbers increasing once again, especially when border posts are in place in the EU.","text",111
"https://www.animalask.org/post/party-politics-for-animal-advocacy-1","Therefore, it would be reasonable to expect a live export ban to prevent a few hundred thousand animals being exported live from the UK each year. Since two-thirds of the UK's live exports are to the EU, the journey times for most of these animals would probably be relatively short (hours or days). A minority of animals may experience longer journey times. As such, a live export ban would probably prevent somewhere in the vicinity of 5,000 animal-years of suffering per year. Given the public support in the UK for a live export ban(42), only a proportion of this policy would be attributable to CAWF (though it may well be a large proportion or even a majority).","text",112

The inclusion of decapod crustaceans and cephalopods as sentient beings will probably cause concrete improvements in the lives of these animals, as we concluded inour recent report on this topic(18): ""Though the sentience of decapod crustaceans and cephalopods has now been recognised, they are still not included in even the basic protections of the Animal Welfare Act, and they are certainly not protected by more detailed secondary legislation, such as a Code of Practice. This makes the recognition of their sentience relatively symbolic so far, but since this is a recent development, it will be important to see if they are later included in the Animal Welfare Act (2006) or other legislation, as the government-commissioned report recommends. [...] Also remarkably, as part of the UK recognition of animal sentience, an independent committee of animal sentience is to be established with the task of ensuring that other government departments pay due respect to animal sentience in their decision-making. The independent nature of this committee could be an asset, since it will make it less likely that it will be captured by industry interests. The government has said that sentience will not take priority over other considerations when formulating legislation, but this is still very significant. If properly implemented, this would make the UK’s recognition of sentience more concrete and less purely symbolic than any of the other cases we have discussed in this report.""","text",116

"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Legislative lobbying has led to numerous positive outcomes in many policy areas and social movements. For example, lobbying in the United States is responsible for lower taxes on solar power, increased taxes on tobacco, and the establishment of a program to detect asteroids(Lerner 2020). In the animal advocacy movement specifically, one recent victory is the 'End the Cage Age' initiative. This lobbying campaign led to a commitment by the European Commission to phase out the use of cages for hens, sows, calves, and numerous other farmed animals(European Commission 2021).","text",11
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","When evaluating campaign strategy, it is important to have a good way to project the success of competing legislative opportunities. Ideally, this would involve predicting the degree to which lobbying effort makes a legislative opportunity more likely to succeed, compared to the scenario where that additional effort does not take place. We refer to this as the counterfactual impact of lobbying. Understanding this would provide insight into how campaigning can be most effective.","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Currently, we do not know the best way to measure the counterfactual impact of lobbying. One promising option is to use the academic literature on lobbying. The published studies on lobbying could be used to derive estimates of policy success and, ideally, the counterfactual impact of lobbying.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","The purpose of this report is to find out whether this academic literature contains quantitative estimates that could be useful in gauging the counterfactual impact of lobbying. We answer this question by reviewing the literature on lobbying and examining studies that have published estimates of the rates of policy success.","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Overall policy success is made up of two components: a baseline rate of policy success, and the counterfactual impact of lobbying. Therefore, to measure the counterfactual impact of lobbying, we need to be able to do two things: 1) measure overall policy success, and 2) break down this overall policy success into the baseline rate of success and the counterfactual impact of lobbying (see Figure 1 below).","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","We find that measuring overall policy success using the academic literature is unlikely to work. The lobbying literature contains many well-known weaknesses which cast doubt on researchers' ability to measure policy success. As well as this, our systematic review found a strange result, which suggests that the published estimates of policy success should not be taken at face value.","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","We find that there is insufficient evidence to break down overall policy success into the baseline rate of success and the counterfactual impact of lobbying. There is only a single study that identifies the counterfactual impact of lobbying. That study was limited to a single policy issue and a single context, and so its findings need to be replicated across other issues and contexts before we can draw any sound conclusions.","text",17
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","In summary, the academic literature does not contain sufficient information to gauge the counterfactual impact of lobbying. For these reasons, we recommend against using estimates from the published literature when modelling the effects of lobbying. Instead, we recommend that researchers choose a different option for incorporating information on the prospects of success. We conclude by highlighting two promising options that deserve further exploration: expert judgement and panels of superforecasters.","text",18
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Although we conducted this research to guide our own research process at Animal Ask, this report may also be useful to other researchers. In particular, we expect this to prove useful to researchers who forecast legislative outcomes, as well as those interested more generally in the academic literature on lobbying.","text",19
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Figure 1: The overall observed success rates of policies are made up of two parts: the baseline success rates of policies (grey puzzle piece) and the counterfactual impact of lobbying (blue puzzle piece). Assessing the counterfactual impact of lobbying would be very useful for evaluating campaign strategies. However, academic research has mostly focused on studying the overall success rates of policies, and that research has encountered serious difficulties. There is currently insufficient evidence to gauge the counterfactual impact of lobbying based on the academic literature.","text",20

"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","When conducting research to guide policy and social movement strategy, a common goal is to recommend which campaign opportunities have the greatest prospect of success¹. This often involves systematically comparing different campaign opportunities. Many campaigns involve lobbying government officials, and so research into this often involves trying to predict the outcome of lobbying government officials for particular policy goals.","text",23
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Overall policy success is made up of two components. First, there is a baseline rate of policy success. Bills introduced to a legislature naturally have some baseline probability of passing without any additional effort. Second, there is the counterfactual impact of lobbying. This describes the degree to which lobbying effort increases the probability of policy success. For example, lobbying legislators to support a bill might make it more likely to pass by a certain percentage.","text",24
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","When evaluating campaign opportunities, it would be very helpful to understand the counterfactual impact of lobbying. If there are multiple competing campaign opportunities, and one opportunity appears particularly receptive to lobbying, then it would make sense to focus lobbying resources on that particular opportunity. This would help limited resources be used most effectively.","text",25
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","How might we go about assessing the counterfactual impact of lobbying? The principal option that we explore in this report is to use information published in the academic literature on lobbying.","text",26
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","To measure the counterfactual impact of lobbying from the academic literature, we need to be able to achieve two goals: 1) measure overall policy success, and 2) split this overall policy success into the baseline rate of success and the counterfactual impact of lobbying.","text",27
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Currently, it is unclear whether the academic literature contains sufficient information to achieve these two goals. To determine this, we review the academic literature on lobbying, beginning with a broad overview of the lobbying literature and the serious difficulties that have been encountered in trying to measure overall policy success.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Broadly speaking, the academic research on lobbying has identified a few well-supported findings. Perhaps most importantly, this includes the finding that lobbying is often successful in general(de Figueiredo and Richter 2014; Lerner 2020), as well as for animal advocacy in particular(Animal Charity Evaluators 2022). However, measuring the effectiveness of lobbying is 'extraordinarily challenging'(de Figueiredo and Richter 2014).","text",30
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","There are numerous methods available to researchers who seek to measure the effectiveness of lobbying(Oeri, Rinscheid, and Kachi 2021). Bernhagen, Dür, and Marshall(2014)provide a useful way to classify these methods, based on categorisation as subjective or objective data. Subjective data may involve surveys that ask lobbyists to estimate the success of themselves and others, while objective data involves assessing the actual outcomes of lobbying efforts. It has been documented that when lobbyists estimate their own success, the resulting estimates are higher than would be calculated using objective data(Lyons, McKay, and Reifler 2020).","text",31
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Separately, the scale of measurement can be binary or continuous. A binary scale generally considers lobbying efforts to be either 'successful' or 'not successful' (or a limited number of intermediate options), while a continuous scale considers the level of success along a continuum². The validity of particular methods remains under debate(Adriana Bunea and Ibenskas 2015).","text",32

"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","In the academic literature on lobbying and interest groups, many studies have attempted to measure the influence or success of lobbying. However, these studies have very mixed results(Anzia 2019; Lerner 2020). It has been shown multiple times that many of these studies - sometimes, even a majority - have found results that indicate either no effect or an effect that is different to what is predicted by theory³(Burstein 2019; Burstein and Linton 2002; Lowery 2013; Uba 2009; Burstein 2011). Substantial results occur only a small proportion of the time(Burstein 2011).","text",34
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Nevertheless, the belief that lobbying is a worthwhile endeavour remains widespread among academics, the public, and lobbyists themselves. Lobbying is a multibillion dollar industry because it involves large opportunities and risks(Baumgartner et al. 2009). While nobody seriously believes that lobbying is ineffective(Leech 2010), academic research has found it difficult to prove its effectiveness - a scientific challenge that dates back to at least the 1960s.","text",35
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","There are many barriers faced by researchers on this topic.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","When trying to measure the success of lobbying efforts, researchers face a number of substantive challenges. Some of these challenges are so profound that they might prevent researchers from ever being able to measure lobbying success, even in principle. However, some authors, like Dür(2008b), are more optimistic. Here, we will list the substantive challenges that researchers face, in no particular order.","text",39
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Success in lobbying is highly contingent and context-dependent(Leech 2010). Lobbying involves complex interactions in dynamic systems and depends on exogenous forces like timing, tactics, targets, salience, party power, political mood, lobbying resources, dominant issue frames, the other issues on the agenda, and the behaviour of other interest groups(Leech 2010; Lowery 2013; Sentience Institute 2020; de Figueiredo and Richter 2014). Many of these forces are inherently unobservable(de Figueiredo and Richter 2014).","text",40
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","In particular, there is a powerful influence of the status quo(Baumgartner et al. 2009; Mahoney 2008). The status quo is strong, and lobbying to change it is difficult(Lowery 2013). There are several reasons for this: policymaker attention is scarce; lobbyists in favour of the status quo can effectively raise general doubts and fear of costs associated with change; the difficulties in creating bipartisan coalitions; the interests that gatekeepers have in maintaining existing policy; and the idea that the status quo already reflects the relative abilities of competing lobbyists(Baumgartner et al. 2009). Lerner(2020)concludes that lobbying for the status quo is more likely to succeed than lobbying against the status quo. Lerner also proposes a way to take advantage of this phenomenon by lobbying to retain beneficial policies that already exist. Relatedly, one study found that lobbying against a proposal is more effective than lobbying for a proposal(McKay 2012a). However, this may be an artefact of studies failing to consider the counterfactual. If the status quo is likely to remain, then lobbying in favour of the status quo might make no difference. In this case, a small amount of lobbying might appear to have a very high probability of success, making lobbying in favour of the status quo appear more effective than it is. Separately, businesses are more likely than advocacy groups to lobby in favour of the status quo(Garlick 2016; Mahoney 2008). If businesses are better at lobbying than advocacy groups, this might confound the relationship between status quo and success, though we emphasise that we have seen no convincing evidence that businesses are better at lobbying than advocacy groups.","text",41
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Defining influence and power is inherently very difficult. Theorists hold that there are several 'faces' of power(Lukes 2004). The first face of power is to do with who wins and loses on particular policy issues. The second face is to do with who can control the agenda on which those issues appear or do not appear. The third face is to do with manipulating the preferences of others, such as via ideology(Dür 2008a; Finger 2019; Dür 2008b). Through the second and third faces, many actors can exercise influence in a way that is totally invisible to researchers(Lowery 2013). For example, if an interest group wants to maintain the status quo, they may lobby to keep a potential reform off of the agenda. If this group succeeds, by definition there would be very little observable behaviour(Lerner 2020). Despite the importance of the second and third faces in understanding lobbying success, few studies have attempted to unravel these(Leech 2010), though some studies do exist(Pedersen and Binderkrantz 2014; Fellowes, Gray, and Lowery 2006; Garlick 2016; Binderkrantz and Rasmussen 2015; Yackee 2012).","text",42
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Dür(2008a, [b] 2008)also identifies numerous pathways to influence. Studies often only focus on one or a handful of these pathways, limiting researchers' ability to detect the full scope of influence. These pathways to influence include access (directly expressing information or demands to decision makers), selection (helping aligned people to win power by influencing the selection of politicians, bureaucrats, etc.), voice (the use of outside lobbying methods, including media statements, rallies, and petitions), and structural coercion (the ability of businesses to influence politicians with minimal or no effort because politicians are incentivised to create a favourable environment towards business). A business can also have substantial structural power due to the popularity of its products with consumers. When a product is perceived as important by consumers, the line between a business's commercial activity and political activity becomes blurred. In this case, deliberate activity like lobbying may not be a useful way to think about political influence(Woll 2019).","text",43
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Similarly, lobbyists have a number of techniques available by which to exercise their influence. These include authority and respect, friendship and benevolence, rational persuasion, selling and suggestion, fraud and deception, and coercion(Lowery 2013; Banfield 1961).","text",44
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","There are many reasons why it might be difficult or impossible to detect true influence. Lowery(2013)identifies many such reasons: some lobbying efforts are inherently more difficult to succeed in than others; groups have other goals than winning (such as organisational survival); professional lobbyists may be incentivised to misrepresent their clients' interests; and, of course, interest groups might actually be weak, with the weak evidence simply reflecting this. Another important reason is that lobbying happens over long periods of time, with earlier efforts affecting later efforts(Baumgartner et al. 2009; Sentience Institute 2020; Lowery 2013; Mahoney 2008). There may even be substantial time lags between cause and effect(Selling 2021), further complicating the process of assessing influence.","text",45
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Interest groups are more likely to lobby when they think they are likely to succeed. This is a form of selection bias, and it means the decision to lobby is non-random(de Figueiredo and Richter 2014; Marie Hojnacki and Kimball 1998). This is particularly problematic for the inferences that we seek to make. Studies cannot analyse lobbying efforts that were never attempted, though some true experimental work has been conducted(Bergan 2009; Cluverius 2017; Sekar 2020). This means that these studies can only make valid inferences about lobbying efforts thatwereattempted. However, research in effective altruism and policy often focuses on hypothetical lobbying efforts, some of which have limited or no precedent in public policy. Even if robust estimates of the base-rate of success of lobbying were available, it would not be clear that these estimates would apply to the hypothetical lobbying efforts that we generally consider.","text",46
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Lobbying is two-sided, and in the vast majority of cases, there are lobbyists on two or more opposing sides of an issue(Baumgartner et al. 2009). A failure for one group often means a success for an opposing group(Lowery 2013; Leech 2010).","text",47
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Given these factors, it is very difficult to determine the counterfactual - in other words, what would have happened if a certain group didnotlobby(Lowery 2013). There are studies that attempt to circumvent this problem, either by looking at all decisions across a given issue or by identifying prior positions(e.g. Yackee and Yackee 2006; Gamboa, Segovia, and Avendaño 2016). However, due to the complex nature of lobbying, with many actors interacting in complex ways, even these methods may struggle to determine the counterfactual. A true experimental study may overcome this limitation, but there have been few such studies(e.g. Bergan 2009; Cluverius 2017; Sekar 2020).","text",48
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","When an actor takes an initial position on some issue, that position is shaped by the anticipated reactions of other actors. This shaping of the initial position of one actor represents true influence on the part of those other actors, yet lobbying research cannot feasibly capture this dynamic(Lowery 2013). Lastly, influence is not a one-way street, and politicians can often manipulate interest groups(Dür 2008a; Lowery 2013).","text",49

"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","In essence, research on lobbying has focused up to now on two broad questions. Firstly, there is the question of influence, looking at how interest group behaviour affects policy outcomes. Secondly, there is the question of success. This involves looking at the extent to which policy outcomes satisfy the preferences of groups(Bernhagen, Dür, and Marshall 2014).","text",51
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Even if answering these two questions is possible in principle, there are many problems that have been identified with the methodology of lobbying research in practice.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","The existing literature suffers from fragmented methodology, frameworks, and vocabulary(Beyers, Eising, and Maloney 2008; Burstein 2019). There is also a large number of exploratory, descriptive studies, making generalisations problematic(Bunea and Baumgartner 2014). There are numerous scales of measurement, and the choice of scale affects a study's results(Bernhagen, Dür, and Marshall 2014; McKay 2012b). Together, these factors make synthesising the literature and drawing conclusions very difficult.","text",53
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Additionally, there is a strong bias towards focusing on wealthy democracies, such as the United States and the European Union, making it difficult to assess the value of lobbying in other places⁴(Bunea and Baumgartner 2014; M.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Meanwhile, there are several research biases that may lead to lobbying influence being underestimated. Within research on the United States, there is a strong focus on the federal government(Anzia 2019). Separately, there is a strong focus on controversial, highly salient issues with lots of interest groups present(Uba 2009; Leech 2010; Anzia 2019; Lowery 2013). In both of those contexts, there are theoretical reasons to expect that lobbying would be less effective. Added to this, there is a consistent focus on studying the interest groups' behaviour, rather than measuring influence from other perspectives(Lowery 2013; Bernhagen, Dür, and Marshall 2014). Finally, there is also a focus on the size of resources and the way they are deployed; this is at odds with the deployment of resources itself, which theory predicts to be important(Burstein and Linton 2002).","text",55

"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Based on the considerable substantive and methodological challenges, some researchers argue that estimating rates of policy success is fundamentally the wrong approach(Leech 2010; Sentience Institute 2020). These researchers maintain that the world of lobbying is governed by uncertainty between lobbying behaviour and outcomes(Lowery 2013; Heinz et al. 1993), with context proving critical(Baumgartner et al. 2009). One such researcher, Frank Baumgartner, compared lobbying to the weather. Under this analogy, lobbying research is more like climate science than weather forecasting: while understanding the complex dynamics at play is both possible and useful, giving point predictions is impossible(Sentience Institute 2020). A different analogy comes from Robert Salisury, who argued that we might as well ask, 'Who is the most influential member of the U.S. Senate?' or 'What is the influence rank among the Supreme Court Justices?'. In other words, since the success of lobbying depends so strongly on context, we are posing a question that is utterly meaningless(Salisbury 1994 cited in Leech 2010)","text",58
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Similarly, Lerner(2020)concludes, in the context of effective altruism, that 'it's not advisable to attempt to extract any quantitative estimate of the effectiveness of lobbying from the published work'. This conclusion seems to be based on the literature's methodological challenges. Under this view, achieving a detailed understanding of policy success may be possible in principle, but would not be feasible until the research field advances.","text",59

"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","To gather all available published studies on success rates of policy, we performed a systematic review of the literature (for a detailed explanation of methods and results, see Appendix 2). From our systematic review, we obtained 16 papers that estimated a probability of success of lobbying. These studies mostly focused on the United States and Europe, although many issues and types of lobbying (i.e. lobbying for both social causes and economic causes) were represented. Of the 16 papers we obtained, 14 were based on observational studies, and two were based on experimental studies.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","In the 14 observational studies, the estimated rates of policy success were narrowly distributed around 50%. This pattern was unexpected and strange. There is a hypothesis that could explain this pattern, though we note that we are speculating here, and hypothesising after having seen our results. For any particular issue, there are usually both winners and losers(Baumgartner et al. 2009). A single policy outcome might be recorded as a success for one group and a failure for an opposing group. Indeed, many of the observational studies highlighted that most issues were contested by multiple groups. So, across many issues and a large sample size, a researcher might naturally observe that around 50% of lobbying efforts succeed(Lowery 2013; Leech 2010; Baumgartner et al. 2009). If this reason is indeed why we have observed that the probability estimates tend to sit around 50%, then our evidence might contain useful information on the big picture of the world of lobbying, but it would not contain useful information on the success rate of any particular policy or group of policies.","text",71

"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","In one experimental study, Bergan(2009)conducted an experiment in which emails from an anti-smoking coalition were delivered to state legislators in New Hampshire, United States. There was a treatment group consisting of 72 legislators, who did receive emails, and a control group of 71 legislators, who did not receive emails. Bergan analysed the actual votes of legislators during two pivotal votes on a smoke-free workplace bill. In the vote on whether to table the bill, 48% of legislators in the control group voted in favour of the bill, compared to 62% in the treatment group⁶. In the vote on passing the bill, 42% of legislators in the control group voted in favour, compared to 50% in the treatment group. It is unclear whether it is more appropriate to view this experiment as a single lobbying effort targeting one bill, or a series of many lobbying efforts, each targeting one legislator. Therefore, while this study does appear to show that the counterfactual impact of lobbying in this context is positive, it is difficult to conclude what the exact value of that counterfactual impact is more generally.","text",74
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","In another experimental study, Cluverius(2017)conducted a hypothetical experimental study, delivered as a survey to state legislators in seven states in the United States. The survey included a hypothetical email from imagined constituents asking legislators to take action on an issue. The survey asked legislators which action they would take in response to the hypothetical email. Cluverius found that 8.5% of legislators would introduce a bill; 19.3% would cosponsor a bill; 32.6% would vote for a bill; and 16.3% would urge fellow legislators to support a bill. These results did vary across the salience of the issue (e.g. gun control vs GMO labelling) and across the volume of emails that the survey asked legislators to imagine they had received. However, the study's design did not include a control group. This means that the counterfactual impact of lobbying cannot be inferred from the results.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","But it is possible to take a step back and consider how policy issues appear in the first place.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Introducing new pieces of legislation (the second face of power) is indeed a focus for some animal advocacy organisations. These organisations might campaign to submit a new Bill into Parliament or Congress, or they might seek to add a new regulation that is not already under consideration.","text",89
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","For these organisations, it is most useful to know the base rates of success of different types of policies. For example, an organisation might already be in contact with Members of Parliament and thus have the ability to introduce a new Bill. Here, the organisation might just want to know what type of policies are most likely to succeed - is it better to introduce a narrow, obscure Bill that limits the expansion of new insect farms, or is it better to introduce a broader, more popular Bill that restricts pollution from chicken farms?","text",90
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","In this case, the counterfactual impact of additional lobbying, as we have investigated in this report, is less relevant. What really matters is the baseline rate of success of a policy. Building on the previous example, it might be possible to examine all Bills introduced to Parliament in a particular time-frame. Hypothetically, we might observe that Bills that are narrower, more obscure, and focused on smaller industries tend to pass into law more than Bills that are broader, more popular, and focused on larger industries. In this case, it would be wiser for animal advocacy organisations to focus their efforts on the types of Bills that tend to pass into law more often⁸. Or, we might observe that Bills related to one species pass into law more often than Bills related to another species - that would be one reason to focus an organisation's efforts on the former species for the time being.","text",91

"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","We conducted a pilot study to determine whether it is possible to gain insight into this question. Our pilot study involved an analysis of pro-animal Bills. For the pilot study, we chose to analyse Bills in Australia, which is a country that has a political system very similar to countries that are high-priority for animal advocacy (namely, the UK). The lead author is also familiar with the Australian context. Specifically, we analysed Bills in one Australian federal Parliament (42nd Parliament, 2008-2010) and one state Parliament (New South Wales, 56th Parliament, 2015-2019).","text",94
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","Our goal was to uncover whether it was possible to link the success of Bills to particular characteristics. For example, were more successful Bills generally focused on a particular species? Or did they have a particular scope, or a particular level of public engagement?","text",95
"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","We quickly found that Bills introduced by the government had all been successful, and Bills introduced by other Members of Parliament (private members) were never successful. We expect that this is because Australia has a two-party system and a strong party whip, which is also the case in the UK. This trend may be less strong in other countries. For example, US legislatures have weaker party whips, and many European countries have multi-party systems. However, it is clear that the success or failure of Bills depends strongly on the context of a particular political system. So, we think that analysing Bills in a particular country might produce useful insights for organisations working in that country, but these insights would be unlikely to generalise to other countries.","text",96

Many academic studies use methods that capture partial success (see footnote on binary vs continuous methods below). We think that modelling partial success is even more difficult than modelling success vs failure, and so we ignore partial success here.","text",147

"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying","3.  These 'informal meta-analysis' papers rely on vote counting, which is a very problematic way to integrate information across multiple studies (Borenstein et al. 2021). However, we agree with the authors of these papers that the ideal method, formal meta-analysis, would be poorly suited to studies on lobbying and interest groups due to the inconsistent methods used in this field.","text",149

"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY","text",10
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Many animal advocacy organisations around the world are campaigning to establish an Independent Office (or Commissioner) of Animal Protection. What benefits could such an Office bring to the lives of animals? And how could an organisation tell if this campaign is a priority in a particular country?","text",11
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Independent Offices are designed to help overcome a particular problem in government regulation: regulatory capture.Regulatory capture occurs when regulation is co-opted to serve the interests of an industry or another specific group, rather than the public. When it comes to animal welfare, regulatory capture occurs when the interests of the animal agriculture industry is unduly prioritised over meaningful animal welfare standards. This phenomenon often arises when a single government institution (e.g. the country's department for agriculture) is responsible for both promoting the animal agriculture industry and setting the animal welfare standards that regulate that industry.","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","The 'gold standard' reform to overcome regulatory capture is to establish an Independent Office of Animal Protection, which is a separate government authority with the responsibility to set animal welfare standards without undue interference. Other smaller, more tractable reforms exist: one example is to move the responsibility for animal welfare out of the agriculture department and into another department; another example is to establish a Commissioner for Animal Protection, which is a more limited government authority with the power to hold accountable the department that does have responsibility for animal welfare.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","In general, campaigning for an Independent Office (or Commissioner) of Animal Protection involves high-level policy reform, so this campaign is more challenging than other campaigns. So, this campaign is an effective choice in a particular country if several key conditions are met:","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","The country must have strong institutions, effective democracy, and a concern for animal welfare. These are necessary for an Independent Office to bring about improvements in animal welfare.","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Regulatory capture must exist in that country's animal welfare regime. Regulatory capture is the problem that an Independent Office can help solve.","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","That capture must be limiting the progress in the country's animal welfare standards. This would provide the motivation to select this more challenging campaign over other options for campaigns.","text",17
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","We provide some tests that can be used to examine these conditions in a particular country, and we give examples to illustrate how these tests work. Lastly, we conclude with some strategy recommendations for campaigning for an Independent Office.","text",18
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","BACKGROUND TO REGULATORY CAPTURE","text",19
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Why might animals benefit from an Independent Office for Animal Protection? The motivation lies in the phenomenon known as regulatory capture.","text",20
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Essentially, regulatory capture occurs when regulation is co-opted to serve the interests of an industry or another specific group, rather than the public.","text",21
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","For animals, regulatory capture usually means that animal welfare regulations serve the interests of the farming industry in economic profit and growth rather than the general public's interest in animal welfare.","text",22
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","In animal welfare regulation, the most common way for regulatory capture to occur is by a conflict of interest. Due to poor institutional design, a government department can experience a conflict of interests between its responsibility to help an industry grow and become more profitable and its responsibility to regulate an industry(1). In animal agriculture, this typically occurs when the responsibility for regulating animal welfare is delegated to the agriculture ministry (or whichever ministry, department or agency that also has the responsibility for the protection, profitability, and growth of the animal agriculture industry).","text",23
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Animal welfare regulations can also be captured via cultural capture, where an industry's regulators are influenced through non-conscious, non-material means(1). For example, regulators can identify as part of the same group as industry members, view industry members as high-status, or belong to relationship networks with industry members(2). In animal agriculture, cultural capture could, for example, involve members of regulatory agencies having close connections with farmers or adopting the ideological beliefs, norms, or perspectives of the farming community(1,3).","text",24
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","There are other mechanisms by which regulatory capture can occur. These are less relevant to animal agriculture, but they may play a role at times. These mechanisms include the limitation of expertise and training to a handful of professional schools or programmes in which the curriculum favours industry interests(4); regulators' material self-interests, including the need for funding, legislative support, or future jobs from the industry(1,2); the possibility that more mature regulatory agencies end up protecting the industry to justify the agency's own existence(1,5); asymmetric information, where the regulator is dependent on the industry for information, expertise, or talent(1,4); industry control over the scientific studies on which regulators depend, which can occur when industry provides funding or proprietary data to academics(6); and threats of legal or political retaliation(7,8). The mechanism that facilitates regulatory capture in a particular context will determine which policy reform is best suited to overcoming capture in that context.","text",25
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","INDEPENDENT OFFICE OF ANIMAL PROTECTION","text",26
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","By understanding the conditions that facilitate regulatory capture in animal agriculture, it is possible to campaign for policy reforms that can overcome regulatory capture. Every day, well-designed policies and institutions enable government agencies around the world to resist industry pressure and protect the public interest(9). How might the capture of animal welfare regulations be overcome?","text",27
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","One policy that can help to overcome regulatory capture is the establishment of an Independent Office of Animal Protection¹. A government could establish such an Independent Office and transfer responsibility for the creation and enforcement of secondary animal welfare regulations away from the agriculture department to that Independent Office(1,3). This would mean that the responsibility to protect animal welfare is separated from the responsibility to protect the interests of the agriculture industry.

Goodfellow's academic work analysed the question of what an Office should look like and gave concrete recommendations(1,3). A 2015 Bill, introduced to Australia's Federal parliament by the Greens party, gives an example of how the legislation creating an Office could be crafted(10).

"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","An Independent Office of Animal Protection is the 'gold standard' of animal regulatory reform. However, a full Independent Office may not be tractable in a particular political context.","text",41
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","One option that may be more tractable is to campaign for a Commissioner for Animal Protection. A Commissioner is like a smaller, more limited version of an Independent Office. Rather than having full jurisdiction over animal welfare regulation, a Commissioner would exist to monitor and audit the performance of the department thatdoeshave jurisdiction(1). A Commissioner is a type of proxy advocate - by studying the regulatory process and reporting on shortcomings and improvements, a Commissioner can help overcome biases and inaction in the government's animal welfare regulatory regime, even despite the Commissioner's limited powers(12). This type of entity can also be called an Inspector-General.","text",42
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","In Malta, there exists aCommissioner for Animal Welfare. The Commissioner for Animal Welfare was established by a 2014 amendment to Malta's Animal Welfare Act(13), after campaigning by animal advocacy organisations led to a 2013 election promise by the Labour party(14). The Commissioner has the power to conduct independent investigations into animal welfare regulations, publish reports, and make recommendations to the government(13). The Commissioner also has an educational role that involves promoting public dialogue on animal issues. However, the Commissioner does not have the power to investigate specific instances of cruelty (a responsibility held by other authorities) or enforce recommendations(14). The Commissioner is appointed by the Prime Minister, after consultation with the Minister responsible for veterinary services. Since 2021, the position of Commissioner has been held by Alison Bezzina, a well-known animal rights activist. Bezzina publishes quarterly and annual reports. During 2021, Bezzina's first year as Commissioner, she made 15 recommendations to the government: eight of these related to dog and cat welfare, four to enforcement of animal welfare laws, one to the resources allocated to animal welfare governance, one to animals kept in zoos, and one to wild animals(15). Many of these have been implemented, and some remain under discussion. Bezzina's first year also involved conducting some investigations, mostly into dog welfare, and distributing educational materials to schools and homes. There is notably a focus on companion animals, like dogs and cats, rather than farmed animals. This is because the Commissioner does not investigate instances of cruelty themselves - rather, the Animal Welfare directorate and the Veterinary Services directorate conduct investigations, and if members of the public are dissatisfied, they can ask the Commissioner to investigate the functions of those directorates. Since the public is in greater contact with companion animals, the result is that much of the Commissioner's work relates to companion animals, rather than farmed animals²(14).","text",43
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Another example of a proxy advocate, albeit with a limited scope, is Australia'sInspector-General of Live Animal Exports. This position was established in 2019 following the recommendation of an independent review into the 'regulatory capability and culture of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry' relating to trade and live animal exports. This independent review found that live animal export posed a high risk to animal welfare and that there is an inherent contradiction in the Department's dual role as both a facilitator of trade and a regulator of trade(16). As such, the review recommended that an Inspector-General be established to 'review the performance of functions or exercise of powers by department staff members in the regulation of live animal exports'. The Inspector-General reviews the performance of the Department in regulating exports of live animals. The Inspector-General is following a three-year work plan, which includes reviews into topics including: monitoring and reporting requirements during voyages; processes around granting permits for live exports; supply chain standards; stakeholder engagement and responses to inquiries, complaints, and incidents; improvements in information technology; and implementation of new legislation.","text",44

"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","We spoke to a number of organisations campaigning for an Independent Office (or Commissioner) for Animal Protection in various countries. Those conversations revealed a number of strategic considerations when it comes to this campaign:","text",69
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","The closest example to a successful campaign is in Malta, which has a Commissioner for Animal Welfare. This position arose after campaigns by animal advocacy organisations led to a 2013 election promise by the Labour party to establish a Commissioner(14). This promise was fulfilled, although the role as established was admittedly slightly different to the role that was promised. Nevertheless, this indicates that campaigning for an Independent Office (or Commissioner) is tractable.","text",70
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","The strategy of the Australian Alliance for Animals is to use three prongs: gathering public support, engaging the government (e.g. attracting the support of MPs with strong policy briefings), and building political pressure to make this policy a priority, particularly during election campaigns.","text",71
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Generally, the public is receptive to this campaign. Learning about the contradiction of animal welfare being the responsibility of the agriculture ministry can be a revelation for many people. Awareness and support can be generated through media coverage, particularly when an instance of cruelty is publicised or when a contradictory position by the agriculture minister is exposed. The support of community organisations - particularly organisations that are popular among the public - is also important.","text",72
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","The details of the campaign and the proposed policy need to be adapted to the political context and political dynamics of a particular country. For example: in New Zealand, a Commissioner appears more politically feasible than an Independent Office because the country has a history of establishing Commissioners in other policy areas; Australia and Canada have federal systems, which affects where responsibility for animal welfare sits and the number of different governments that need to be brought on board with a campaign; and in Australia, the animal agriculture industry has more influence over one major political party (Liberal) than another (Labor), which means that the campaign may have greater success when the latter party is in power.","text",73
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Advocates should understand that this campaign is not merely a technical change. Rather, the campaign is fundamentally about power - specifically, who has power over animal welfare standards. The animal agriculture industry can feel threatened by this campaign because it sees the campaign as seeking to take power away from the industry. As such, this campaign will always involve a political battle.","text",74
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Ideally, the policy needs to be implemented in a way that will not cause it to be abolished as soon as there is a change in government. Building relationships with politicians from all major political parties could help with this. One strategic choice could also be to accept a compromise proposal, even if that proposal is watered down compared to the 'gold standard'. This would help parties and stakeholders become familiar with the concept and avoid regulatory shocks - then, in the future, the policy could be progressively developed into something more impactful.","text",75
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Similarly, when an Independent Office or a Commissioner is established, it must not be subject to regulatory capture itself. This risk can be reduced by ensuring that the legislation protects the independence of the Office and provides sufficient guidance and transparency around the appointment of key personnel. Likewise, a policy that grants the Independent Office or Commissioner concrete powers - rather than acting as a merely consultative role - is, of course, preferable(14).","text",76
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","The way the policy is implemented can affect the types of policy reforms that the Independent Office or Commissioner can bring about. In Malta, the position of the Commissioner for Animal Welfare is largely designed to respond to specific public concerns about the way cases of cruelty are investigated - since the public is in greater contact with dogs and cats, this means that the Commissioner spends almost all of their time on dogs and cats rather than farmed animals(14). Since farmed animals represent the overwhelming majority of animals (and avoidable suffering) in any given country, implementing the policy in a way that permits a focus on farmed animals would be very beneficial.","text",77
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Lastly, it is emphasised that this campaign is likely to be a relatively long battle. High-level policy reform is inherently the most difficult type of campaign. For this reason, it is useful to think long-term and build strong relationships with MPs and political parties.","text",78

"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Beyond the Independent Office and Commissioner policies, there are other options for policy reform to overcome regulatory capture in a country or jurisdiction's animal welfare regime. These options could also be useful additional policies to complement an Independent Office or Commissioner as part of a larger collection of reforms.","text",80
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Responsibility for animal welfare could be moved to a different, existing department to avert the conflict of interest. Although the EU did not establish an Independent Office for Animal Welfare, it did move responsibility for animal welfare from the Directorate-General for Agriculture to the Directorate-General for Health and Consumers(1). Likewise, in Switzerland, responsibility for animal welfare is held by the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office, which sits under a department separate to that of the Federal Office for Agriculture.","text",81
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Another option is a tripartite programme(1). Tripartite programmes empower non-government organisations that would typically be underrepresented in the regulatory regime. These programmes grant non-government organisations (NGOs) all of the information that is available to the regulator, allow NGOs to have a seat alongside industry and the regulator during negotiations, and grant NGOs the same power to sue as the regulator(1). For a tripartite programme to work, there must be a robust network of existing non-government organisations(6). When compared with a regulatory contrarian, tripartite programmes might be more desirable when there is no single, clear 'public interest' position, or when the threat of political pressure is an important advocacy tactic(6). Goodfellow(1)speculates that advocating for the establishment of a tripartite programme for animal welfare regulation may be too difficult due to the structure and culture of typical agriculture departments.","text",82
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","There are a handful of other tools that can help overcome regulatory capture. However, these suffer from weaknesses when applied to animal agriculture:","text",83
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Judicial review of regulatory decisions through the courts(28). A number of animal advocacy groups exist to fill this function (e.g. Advocates for Animals, Legal Impact for Chickens). However, as a method for addressing regulatory capture, judicial review suffers from some weaknesses: it considers only the tiny proportion of cases that are brought before the court; and it requires the ongoing effort and engagement of animal advocacy organisations, rather than advocating for the government to invest the effort in fixing its own poorly designed institutions.","text",84
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","A number of other mechanisms that promote greater openness around regulations, including more public input and greater media coverage and journalistic scrutiny(7). These are less relevant for animal agriculture, as regulatory capture often stems from the disproportionate power held by industry voices in negotiation, rather than an absence of public input or media coverage per se. The absence of public input is often a symptom, rather than a cause, of regulatory capture.","text",85
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Lastly, policy reforms can be complemented by animal welfare advisory committees. These committees typically consist of representatives from industry, animal advocacy organisations, government departments, veterinarians, and experts from animal science, ethics, and economics³. These committees provide scientific evidence and policy advice. Such committees exist in the UK, Canada, New Zealand, the EU, and numerous countries within the EU.","text",86

"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Where a country's animal welfare regulation is subject to capture, one option is to campaign for an Independent Office of Animal Protection. Campaigns that are smaller, but potentially more tractable, include a Commissioner for Animal Protection, or simply moving responsibility for animal welfare to a different government department. These campaigns address the conflict of interest between promoting the animal agriculture industry and setting animal welfare standards. This would mitigate, or possibly even overcome, the effects of regulatory capture, thus improving the outlook for improvements of the country's animal welfare standards in the future.","text",88
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","This campaign is likely to be effective in countries with strong institutions, with support for animal welfare, and where regulatory capture is limiting the progress in animal welfare standards.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","When it comes to regulatory capture in animal agriculture, the seminal study is that by Goodfellow(1,3). Goodfellow's study adopts Professor Barry Mitcnick's definition of regulatory capture(29):","text",91
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","‘Capture’ is said to occur if the regulated interest controls the regulation and the regulated agency; or if the regulated parties succeed in co-ordinating the regulatory body’s activities with their activities so that their private interest is satisfied; or if the regulated party somehow manages to neutralize or ensure nonperformance (or mediocre performance) by the regulating body; or if [...] the regulated party succeeds (perhaps not even deliberatively) in co-opting the regulators into seeing things from their own perspective and thus giving them the regulation they want; or if, quite independently of the formal or conscious desires of either the regulators or the regulated parties the basic structure of the reward system leads [...] regulators inevitably to a community of interests with the regulated party.","text",92
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Goodfellow(1,3)proposed a framework that can be used to assess evidence on regulatory capture in the animal welfare regime of a particular country or jurisdiction.

Thirdly, one must show a causal relationship between those three indicators and some mechanism of regulatory capture.","text",93
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","To show that a policy has shifted away from the public interest towards industry interests, Goodfellow gives three indicators of regulatory failings.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","To illustrate this framework, we will describe how Goodfellow applied it to the context of animal welfare regulations in Australia. As a model of the public interest, Goodfellow","text",98
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","proposed that, in Australia, there is a public interest in: '(1) protecting farm animals from cruelty; and (2) promoting farm animal welfare through incremental, but sustained, improvements in welfare standards over time'. Goodfellow argues that this two-fold public interest is the purpose of animal welfare legislation throughout the country and also reflects empirical research on public opinion. Goodfellow then showed how the three indicators of regulatory failings are present in Australia:","text",99
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Inadequate animal welfare standards were shown in three ways. Public opinion surveys show that majorities of the Australian public believe existing standards to be cruel or below their expectations; developments in other Western, developed countries (the EU, Canada, and the US) show that Australia lags behind these countries in animal welfare standards; and Australian animal welfare standards fail to meet principles established by animal welfare legislation, including the principle of proportionality.","text",100
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","The prevalence of serious animal welfare incidents in the agricultural sector was demonstrated by listing the numerous incidents revealed by the media, animal advocacy organisations, and the government.","text",101
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","The presence of regulatory process deficiencies was demonstrated by showing that industry interests dominate the standard setting process; that the industry has a large amount of control over animal welfare science, including the projects conducted, the scientists involved, how the research is conducted, and how the work is reported; and that government inspection regimes have been substituted by industry-run quality assurance schemes.","text",102
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","As such, Goodfellow concludes that the Australian animal welfare regime 'bear[s] all the hallmarks' of regulatory capture. This framework can be applied in the same way to test for the presence of regulatory capture in any country or jurisdiction.","text",103
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Goodfellow(1,3)critically examined claims of regulatory capture in the general governance of animal welfare in Australia. Goodfellow provided an overview of the farm animal welfare regulatory framework in Australia. Then, Goodfellow tested whether the conditions for regulatory capture exist in that framework, using some specific indicators (discussed below). The analysis found that Australia's animal welfare regulatory framework 'bear[s] all the hallmarks of [...] regulatory capture'. The analysis showed that agriculture departments do indeed experience a conflict of interest by which the productivity and profitability of agriculture are unduly prioritised over animal welfare. The analysis also showed that the animal welfare regulatory framework is dominated by institutions with 'one particular set of values towards animals and their place in the world relative to human beings'. Goodfellow identified some specific problems with the animal welfare regulatory framework, including the overrepresentation of industry interests in developing welfare standards; industry influence over animal welfare science; and insufficient monitoring and enforcement.","text",104
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","A similar analysis by Ong(30)analysed regulatory capture in New Zealand. Ong drew on Goodfellow's indicators of regulatory capture and examined how they apply in New Zealand's animal welfare regime. This analysis found that New Zealand, like Australia, places the interests of the animal agriculture industry over the interests of the general public in protecting animal welfare. Ong argued that this regulatory capture results from the poor institutional design of the Ministry for Primary Industries, which in turn led to the cultural capture of regulators.","text",105
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","New Zealand's animal welfare regime was also the subject of the case study analysed by Duffield(31). Duffield described how animal advocacy organisations publicised footage from an independent investigation showing the cruelty and suffering experienced by young calves in the dairy industry. The Ministry for Primary Industries responded by quickly creating new regulations on the treatment and welfare of young calves. Duffield argued that the Ministry was motivated to create new regulations to protect New Zealand's reputation among the country's trade partners. However, this instrumental approach was at odds with the non-instrumental public interest in animal welfare, which is enshrined in the country'sAnimal Welfare Act 1999.As such, Duffield concludes that the Ministry's response was characteristic of regulatory capture.","text",106

Morris draws on government documents and meeting minutes to describe the disproportionate power of industry groups on animal welfare standards in New Zealand. They argue that the ministry is 'looking after the interests of producers, not animals'. The mechanisms that Morris describes as causing this problem are, using the terminology that we outline above, cultural capture and veiled legal threats.

Careyet al.(35)examine a case study in which the Australian egg industry succeeded in maintaining its preferred, looser definition of 'free range' eggs, despite a consumer campaign seeking a more strict definition. In this sense, the egg industry succeeded in capturing the definition of a labelling term. In another study, Careyet al.(36)showed how the regulatory dynamics in the pig farming industry - including the power of retailers and the need by animal advocates to selectively focus on a single dimension of pig welfare - enabled the industry to co-opt a campaign by animal advocacy organisations against sow stalls. This enabled the 'concept of pig welfare to be corporatized in a way that maintains the dominant model of factory farmed pig meat production'.","text",109
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","Goodfellow(1)describes how, in the European Union (EU), the responsibility for animal welfare was moved from the Directorate-General for Agriculture to the Directorate-General for Health and Consumers. This separation of powers may help prevent regulatory capture of animal welfare policy at the EU level.","text",110
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","In North America, conflicts-of-interest and regulatory capture in animal welfare regulation and enforcement have been touched on by a handful of studies(37–41). Notably, Bloom(42)describes a legal case in New Jersey,New Jersey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and ors v. New Jersey Department of Agriculture and ors (Supreme Court of New Jersey, 30 July 2008). In that case, animal protection organisations challenged the Department of Agriculture's animal welfare regulations. The court found that 'the Department did not simply engage in a subdelegation, but did so in favor of some entities that also might be described as private interests'.","text",111

"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","1. This policy is also called an Independent Office of Animal Welfare or simply an independent animal welfare authority. In this report, we use the term Animal Protection because the objective of such an Independent Office could, in principle, establish protections for animals that go beyond their welfare. The specific name is a bit of a distraction - the structure, function, and powers of the body are the important details. We do also refer to the policy using different names when discussing specific examples or proposals.","text",113
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","2. One could therefore speculate that in Malta (and future jurisdictions with Independent Offices or Commissioners), building public concern for farmed animals could be a useful advocacy strategy.","text",114
"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection","3. Goodfellow argues that the scientific experts should be separated from the representatives of industry and animal advocacy organisations. This way, scientific statements can be used as the basis for political debates about values, rather than allowing scientific evidence and values to become conflated.","text",115

"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Shareholder activism (1) is a method of achieving change by buying the shares of corporations and leveraging the rights associated with that partial ownership. It has seen increasing use over the years, including many cases where the principal motivation is the public good, rather than corporate reform to maximise shareholder profit.","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Shareholder activism relies on the unappreciated fact that, fundamentally, corporations are owned by their shareholders and there are automatic rights associated with that. It can be seen as the ultimate form of insider activism, since the approach reliably gives you the opportunity to talk directly with company board members.","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Depending on the number of shares owned, there are a number of formal mechanisms to achieve this change. Shareholder activism is possible with remarkably few shares in the company as independent shareholders may be enlisted to support the proposal. However, this requires awareness and buy-in from the other shareholders, and so shareholder activism benefits from coordination with a broader campaign on the subject to provide that.","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Shareholder activism should be done as part of an expert and dedicated group, or at least in coordination with one, since there are specific procedures that must be followed to avoid having the proposal dismissed on a technicality, and thereby block future advocacy attempts on that issue.","text",17
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Shareholder activism has seen tremendous success as an advocacy tool with some significant successes relating to animal advocacy. The literature on shareholder activism generally supports this picture.","text",18
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Furthermore, we think there are opportunities to increase the amount of shareholder activism work being done for animal advocacy, though this should be done carefully as there are risks associated with any cavalier implementation of shareholder activism, including from lack of coordination with existing shareholder activist groups.","text",19

"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Shareholder activism has contributed to notable successes, though the precise causality is often not certain. The Shareholder Action Guide(Behar 2016)describes some of these cases:","text",22

"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","The successes have accumulated over a relatively short period of time. Shareholder activism has not been used much historically, but may have become much more common and effective in recent years. For example, Ertimur et al.(2010)found that the fraction of proposals receiving majority support increased from 10% in 1997 to more than 30% in 2003 to 2004. This could be due to large scandals and corporate governance in 2001 and 2002 (such as Enron) which propelled corporate governments into a central concern with obvious material implications on shareholder value.","text",27

"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Once these conditions are met, you may file a shareholder resolution which is a request to the company for a reform or for further research for a proposed reform (to be presented to other shareholders).","text",37
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","There are strict rules of the form that shareholder resolutions must take. For example, there is a strict character limit of 500 characters in the statement of the resolution and it must not contain any false or misleading statements. If criteria such as these are not met, the resolution can be thrown out on a technicality(Behar 2016). For this reason it is important that it be done by a professional team with knowledge of the intricacies of shareholder activism(Behar 2016).","text",38
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Other than the staff time, the cost of shareholder resolutions can be very low, though that cost can climb dramatically if advocacy methods are used alongside it, such as targeted ads (expert interviews).","text",39
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Once the resolution is formulated and submitted, it is voted on by the shareholders who have a number of votes according to their proportional ownership of the company. Resolutions must achieve at least 5% support in the first year in order to be retabled at the next year’s shareholder meeting or 15% in the second, and 25% in subsequent years(USSIF, n.d.).

Indeed, in a typical year, only 10% to 20% of shareholder proposals that were put to a vote received over 20% approval by the shareholders(Hallaj 2013). However (and fortunately), resolutions do not need to achieve majority support to prompt company action, since it may be easier for the company to acquiesce rather than risk even partial alienation of its shareholders and the reputational risk they are concerned with. Indeed, even 10% approval for a shareholder resolution indicates significant dissent within the company, equivalent to a very large shareholder of the company disagreeing with company policy(“Shareholder Advocacy as a Tool for Change” 2020; Behar 2016).","text",41

"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","If the company does not back down, and the shareholder activist organisation decides it wants to push its case, the situation can escalate into a proxy fight. In a proxy fight, the shareholder activist team attempts to get other shareholders on side and vote out some or all of the board of directors, replacing them with others who are sympathetic to the animal welfare reforms in question and who will work to implement them. This represents a very significant escalation compared to simply resubmitting a shareholder resolution.","text",43
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","As described, proxy fights are extremely expensive, costing an average of $1.8 million (with a high of 25 million) for the shareholder and $3.9 million (with a high of $35 million) for the company(Levin 2022). These costs come from attorneys, bankers, public relations, consultants, among other advisors, as well as from proxy solicitation. A bare-bones campaign might be able to be run for $10,000 by electronically delivering proxy materials and not paying for most of these services, but this would be unlikely to succeed(Ellis 2023).","text",44
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Because of these costs, it is uncommon for shareholder activism campaigns to come down to a proxy fight. In the data set that Naaraayanan et al.(2020)analysed, only one third of shareholder engagements went to a vote. It is more common for one of the sides to acquiesce. In some ideal cases, such as cases where the reform is not costly or where it brings substantial benefits, the shareholder action may be agreed to without too much pressure.","text",45
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","At least in harder cases, shareholder activism can be viewed as a game of chicken where the activists and those they are trying to convince both try to resolve the issue in their favour without having to pay the costs of a proxy conflict.","text",46

"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","In cases where directly asking for the change may be too ambitious, a shareholder campaign can start more modestly and less directly by asking for a report to be written discussing the risks of the harmful policy in question.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Another common shareholder activism tactic is to ask for the appointment of new board members in the company who are friendly to the desired reforms(Weinstein, de Wied, and Richter 2019).

"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Shareholder activist campaigns are valuable in diversifying the lines of pressure and advocacy. If a company is only being pressured by external groups, it may not be as convincing as if they were also hearing it from people involved with their company. Hearing it from many distinct and diverse sources gives the sense that it is part of a much larger societal trend in that direction.","text",52
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","In this way, shareholder activism campaigns may work best when they are run alongside other animal advocacy campaigns also pushing for the reform in question.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","A broader campaign creates a sense that social change on the issue is imminent, and so the company might as well get off to an early start on it, rather than being ignominiously forced into that position at a later point. Ultimately, in most cases when shareholder animal activism is successful, it will be because shareholder activism successfully convinces the company that the public is on their side, which will be much easier when the reform in question is generally in the spotlight(Hallaj 2013).","text",54
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","It may also be particularly valuable in allowing specific asks to be introduced and negotiated on. Groups operating on the outside may be able to apply general pressure for reform, but if these efforts are to be successful, groups must at some point sit down and work out the details, while groups working on the outside in a more combative way are less likely to get this opportunity.","text",55
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","As such, there should be collaboration, communication, and coordination between  shareholder activists and those running a broader campaign.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","The resolution was eventually passed in the form of the Sullivan Principles (viewable here). These were a series of, progressive for the time, reforms that were supposed to lead to the end of apartheid in South Africa within 10 years. Additionally, by 1986, four additional principles had been added (5). Perhaps under the influence of the Sullivan Principles, General Motors eventually adopted a desegregated workplace in South Africa. From General Motors, these principles spread to other companies working in South Africa(Behar 2016). 12 major US companies signed up in 1977 with an additional 93 signing in the following year, peaking in 1986 with 183 signatories(Malone and Roberts 1994).","text",115
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Isolating causality is difficult here. It seems that shareholder activism is responsible for some, but certainly not all of the successes identified here. Companies operating in apartheid era South Africa faced both immense moral pressure from the public to reform or get out, as well as potential or actual restrictions from the US government, which were expected to have a substantial impact on company practices whether or not shareholder activism took place.","text",116
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Broyles(1998)analyses the overall effect of shareholder activism on the rolling back and abolition of apartheid in South Africa. He argues that shareholder activism was effective in changing corporate policy in this case and that shareholder activism played a significant role in both causing some corporations to cease operations in South Africa and pressuring others to adopt reforms that, while they did not sever all relations, worked against apartheid.","text",117
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","While support for anti-apartheid shareholder resolutions was initially very low, with most receiving less than 10% of the vote during resolutions, Broyles argues that this started the conversation and that support grew steadily over time until majority support was reached. He also suggests that shareholder activism was considerably more effective than these vote shares represent, even in the earlier stages of the anti-apartheid movement.","text",118
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","As one of the earliest cases of shareholder activism, the success of this case should perhaps be less surprising. General Motors did not know how to react to and successfully handle the shareholder resolution against it, and indeed it handled the situation very poorly. We can expect that future shareholder resolutions to be somewhat less effective, as companies learn to effectively adapt to this tactic and counter it(Behar 2016).","text",119
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Does shareholder activism affect firm valuation?","text",120
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","The chief value we see coming from shareholder activism is through its influence on the actions of the firm to reform harmful actions and otherwise reduce the suffering of animals. Any effect these actions have on the expected return through investment in the targeted companies is secondary to this. Nevertheless, shareholder activism would be a more sustainable and attractive approach if it ultimately has a beneficial or at least neutral effect on shareholder returns. If this were true, we would expect more people to be interested in engaging in shareholder activism. Additionally, if shareholder activism positively (or even neutrally) affects share valuation, it will be in the interest of firms to acquiesce to shareholder demands on purely financial grounds.","text",121
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Concerning this question, there are two types of shareholder activism that are sometimes distinguished in the literature. The first is shareholder activism to improve the functioning of the firm principally in order to increase profits, sometimes called financial shareholder activism. For example, if the CEO was performing poorly this form of shareholder activism could be done in order to force the hiring of a new CEO to replace them. The second type of shareholder activism is the type that we are concerned with in this paper, shareholder activism principally motivated for the public good which seeks to improve the moral practice of the company, sometimes called social shareholder activism(Goranova and Ryan 2014). Of course, there may not always be a clear line between these two forms of activism. Immoral practices by companies can often have a strong negative effect on the reputation at some point farther down the line.","text",122
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Denes et al.(2017)finds that concerning smaller scale shareholder activism, financial shareholder activism is successful in boosting the shareholder returns while social shareholder activism “is associated with insignificant or very small changes in target firm value”. In contrast, they find that larger scale shareholder activism that credibly threatens and engages in proxy fights can lead large-scale changes in valuation averaging 15%.","text",123
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","There are also several reviews of the literature that do not separately analyse these two forms of shareholder activism:","text",124
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Bajzik et al.(2023)analyses 67 primary studies on the effects of shareholder activism on share valuation. After correcting for a publication bias that they detect, they find that the effects of shareholder activism on share price is between zero and 1.5%.","text",125
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Rafaqat et al.(2022)reviews the literature on shareholder activism between 2000 and 2021, analysing both financial and social shareholder activism. They find that it does affect firm valuation, but in inconsistent directions with some studies finding positive effects, others finding negative, and others finding minimal effects.","text",126
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Dimson et al.(2015)analyses is a database of engagements with 613 US companies carried out by a single shareholder engagement firm in 1999 and 2009. They find that shareholder activism is associated with an increased return of +2.3% over the following year after engagement. They suggest that the reason that firms may not implement these reforms on their own without pressure is that these firms are targeted for their unusually weak governance, which makes reforms less likely. Note that since this examines performance of a single shareholder engagement organisation, the extent to which this generalises is less clear.","text",127
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Overall, we expect that shareholder activism for social reasons will often not affect share valuation, though social activism that focuses on particularly problematic issues that are not expensive to fix may well also increase shareholder valuation.","text",128
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Conclusion and remaining uncertainties","text",129
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","Shareholder activism has shown a great deal of promise in general with inherent strengths, such as an automatic mechanism for being heard and for getting demands met. This contrasts with other methods of advocacy where these must be earned. It has already seen some victories within animal advocacy and has seen very substantial victories in other areas.","text",130
"https://www.animalask.org/post/using-shareholder-activism-to-help-animals","We think there is room to expand the use of shareholder activism for animal advocacy purposes, and judge this would be an effective use of resources, though this should be done only in careful coordination with existing groups because of the inherent difficulty and risk associated with it.","text",131

"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY","text",9
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","The sentience of animals has long been recognised and has continued to be demonstrated on ever firmer scientific grounds. From the Brambell report (1965), which emphasised the importance of sentience in the understanding of animal welfare to the Cambridge Declaration of Consciousness (2012), which suggested widespread scientific acceptance of the idea(Rowanet al.2021). In recent years, this widespread and scientific belief has been explicitly recognised in legislation in a growing number of countries and jurisdictions.","text",10
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","It is certainly crucial that animal sentience be recognised in this way, as it is the most widely accepted basis for the inclusion of animals as moral patients. However, there is another question as to the value of the kind of legislation recognising the sentience of animals that we see in many different countries. This legislation explicitly recognises their sentience, though many other pieces of legislation could be thought to already implicitly do so.","text",11
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","In our research helping organisations prioritise among different potential asks, we have considered the value of animal sentience legislation in many contexts. This report analyses the value of this legislation in terms of its current and future impact on animals.","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","However, despite the apparently high-minded language recognising animal sentience in legislation, it is often accompanied by quite little direct and immediate change for animals. In some cases the legislation is accompanied by some specific statements about what the recognition of animal sentience is taken to directly imply, but there is typically little of this, leaving the legislation to largely be a symbolic statement of pledged values, leading to some concerns that it may be ineffectual legislation that leads to complacency. This type of humane washing remains our biggest concern with the legislation, but we think it is unlikely that it makes the ask net negative.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","In the case of the EU and New Zealand legislation, the intention behind the legislation as purely symbolic has been publicly stated, though this intention does not foreclose the possibility that animal advocates are able to draw some future victories from the legislation. In other cases such as Oregon and Québec we have seen some court cases that have successfully leveraged the legislation to push against the treatment of animals as property, though any significant improvements to animal welfare have yet to be seen.","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","The most successful case so far has been that of the UK, because it promises to establish a committee to make sure that government decisions give due consideration to animal sentience. Further, it includes cephalopods and decapod crustaceans, and there is some chance this will lead to further protection for these animals. However, the head of the sentience committee does not seem like the appropriate choice to ensure its independence because of his conflict of interest as a farmer.","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Despite the absence of direct effects so far, sentience legislation so far has some plausibility as being instrumental in the long-term strategy of the movement. This makes assessing the value of this ask quite difficult, since this potential long-term importance is much more difficult to evaluate.","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Overall, our best estimate is that this ask has modest strength. In other words, with significant uncertainty, we think that the impact is fairly small compared to our top asks. We do not think that there is a risk of this ask being net negative, though we strongly recommend that organisations try to push to get sentience legislation to have concrete protections, so that it is more than symbolic and this risk is minimised. The strength of the ask will of course also vary by country context, and we could imagine it being competitive in certain cases.","text",17
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","This report draws mainly from case studies and existing philosophical and legal research. Expert interviews were also conducted. A more in-depth report could spend more time analysing parallels of potentially symbolic legislation (like declarations of climate emergencies).","text",18

"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Animal protection laws could be seen to at least implicitly recognise animal sentience, since there would be little reason to protect animals otherwise(Kotzmann and Stonebridge 2021). Whilst there are alternative definitions of welfare, such as welfare as biological productivity, many definitions of welfare refer to sentience, and so talk of animal welfare is premised on animal sentience according to these prominent uses of the terms.","text",22
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Animal protection legislation that goes further than specific restrictions and demands more general duty to minimization of pain or suffering could also be seen to more directly assume the sentience of animals, since under many (but not all) definitions of these terms, an animal who can experience pain or suffering is thereby sentient.","text",23
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","There has also been recognition of animal sentience in various official channels, such as court decisions and government reports, that perhaps fall short of a full explicit legislative acknowledgement of sentience(Rowanet al.2021). One example of this is the UK – Australia Free Trade Agreement which acknowledges the sentience of animals, even though Australian legislation itself does not do so(UK Government 2021). The implication of these minor recognitions of animal sentience is not clear, but it is probably not greatly significant.","text",24
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","There is a recent trend to go further than this and explicitly recognise the sentience of animals in legislation(Kotzmann and Stonebridge 2021). Many countries have done this to some extent, but a precise list is difficult because definitions of what it means to recognise sentience vary, and so other writers may have somewhat different lists.","text",25
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","The countries that we consider to have legislation recognising the sentience of animals are Chile, Colombia, Peru, Tanzania, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and all EU countries(Rowanet al.2021; Kotzmann and Stonebridge 2021). Indonesia, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey do not recognise animal sentience as such, but refer to animals having mental states as well as physical states(Rowanet al.2021). It has also been recognised in territories including the Canadian province of Québec; the US districts of Oregon, Vermont, Maine, and Washington DC, as well as the Australian state of Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory(“Australian Capital Territory Enacts New Law Recognizing Animal Sentience” 2019; Kotzmann and Stonebridge 2021; VSD 2022).","text",26
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","A number of these countries, such as the European countries and New Zealand, have among the highest animal welfare standards in the world. This suggests a correlation (though not necessarily causation) between the recognition of sentience and broadly high animal welfare standards.","text",27
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","If the sentience of animals is alreadyimplicitin much existing legislation, it naturally raises the question of what is the value of thisexplicitrecognition? The most plausible answer to this is that it brings this rationale into the open where it can be explicitly evoked to claim that current protections do not go far enough and imply more expensive protections.","text",28

"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Whether animals are considered property is hugely relevant according to some animal advocates, such as Gary Francione.

He therefore thinks that the fundamental right that animals need is the right not to be treated as property(Francione 2004).","text",31
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","In contrast, Cass Sunstein(Sunstein and Nussbaum 2004)suggests that ‘property’ is just a label for possible legal statuses, without inherent significance in itself. He suggests that we do not always get to do as we please with all of our property, instead there may be substantial restrictions placed on use of our property (such as with objects of historical importance), without changing the status of property. Furthermore, children have dramatically reduced autonomy compared to adults, yet are still regarded as persons rather than property. This shows that it is possible for the rights of something and our duties towards it to vary substantially independently of whether that thing is ‘property’ or not.","text",32
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","One key example of how sentience legislation has been largely symbolic is how animals are typically still regarded as property in those countries or areas that recognise them as sentient(Sowery 2018; Kotzmann and Stonebridge 2021). The law may recognise some exceptions to their status as property, for example the exceptions that allow them to be rescued in violation of normal property norms when they need medical attention, but in most respects they are still treated as property. The legislation in some areas refers to them as being more than property, but in practice this is largely symbolic because (at least so far) there is little practical consequence to this lofty language(Ferrere 2022). Nevertheless, the traditional interpretations are plausibly pushing at the boundaries of the view of animals as property.","text",33

"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","A further question concerning sentience legislation is how much it can allow us to continue to push these boundaries. Considering primarily the 2015 animal sentience legislation in New Zealand, Ferrere(2022)argues that because the legislation is just a statement of (widely recognised) scientific fact and does not include a statement of how they should be interpreted to guide our conduct, moving forward, it is not aspirational. He therefore will not be very helpful in securing future victories for animal advocacy.","text",35
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Note that he does still think that this curtails the legal benefits of the legislation; he believes that the legislation can have some impact as a signal.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","This interpretation seems to be at least partially contradicted by cases where the legislation seems to be more somewhat broadly and ambitiously interpreted by judges and by government, such as the cases in Oregon that saw some property rights in animals suspended. However, we should note that none of these cases have yet secured large, concrete welfare gains for animals and significantly more ambitious interpretations of this legislation will need to happen if we are to begin to see significant impact for animals. Ultimately, it is a difficult matter of legal interpretation, and while most scholars on the subject seem to be more optimistic than Ferrere, his interpretation remains plausible.","text",37

"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Though the legislation would be better if it protected animals more concretely, the symbolic nature of animal sentience legislation has one strength, which is that the lack of immediate consequences for animals may make it much easier for countries to accept it. The legislation may appear innocuous because it is just a public acknowledgement of implicit values and so might be accepted much earlier than could be possible for stronger legislation(Ferrere 2022). But once accepted, it may serve as the basis for challenges based on the full meaning of the terms and the inconsistency between those lofty terms and current practices.","text",39
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","There may then be some benefit in the fact that the legislation does not spell out its exact implications. This allows for future work by advocates to argue for stronger interpretations of this legislation than might be accepted at current times. The full reach of the legislation, when realised by later activists, may be stronger than we might otherwise be able to pass through legislative means.","text",40
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","In this way it can help future advocacy efforts by placing advocates and governments closer together, causing the government to use the same vocabulary as the advocates and therefore bringing their conceptual and moral frameworks closer together. Advocates no longer have to argue for the importance of sentience since this is already acknowledged in legislation. It offers an easier framework and ground from which to advocate for concrete welfare changes(Rowanet al.2021).","text",41
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","The ability to point out these inconsistencies can bring a change in the advocacy landscape, along with any clauses about how this should be taken into account in decision-making, and the extreme neglect or disregard for that sentience that the government allows in practice.","text",42

"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","One argument for sentience legislation is that it may set a precedent that other countries or territories may follow. With many countries and jurisdictions now recognising the sentience of animals, others that view themselves as having leading animal welfare policies may feel significant pressure to adopt sentience legislation of their own. We can begin to see this with the case of New Zealand, which may have adopted its sentience legislation because it wanted to be seen as a world leader in animal welfare, and so it felt it was necessary to adopt the legislation(Ferrere 2022). Of course, this may not save the policy if it was ineffectual and purely symbolic in the first place, since it might only inspire further ineffectual legislation(Ferrere 2022).","text",45
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","The precedent of many other countries passing legislation to recognise animal sentience may make this ask significantly more tractable.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Countries that are stronger on animal welfare, but have not already adopted animal sentience legislation, might be the best candidates for this legislation because they may be most likely to use the legislation to advance reforms.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","One potentially strong candidate for this legislation is Australia, since the state of Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory have both adopted the legislation. The case could therefore be made to unify these policies by making them federal.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","One important precedent that is beginning to be set is the recognition of the sentience of not only vertebrate animals, but also decapod crustaceans and cephalopods. It stands to reason that legislation recognising the value of relatively more disputed cases of animal sentience would be of higher value than legislation recognising the sentience of other animals. This is because the public is much less aware of the strong scientific case for the sentience of these animals, and so this legislation would be doing more than stating the obvious in recognising their sentience. It may therefore play the role of raising public acceptance of the sentience of these animals.","text",50
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","As part of their submission of evidence for the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill(RP, n.d.)Rethink Priorities conducted a survey on public beliefs about the sentience of invertebrates and how this is affected by expert opinion. They found that a clear majority of the public believed that these animals are sentient, including crabs (78.09%) and octopuses (80.65%). Moreover they found that 91% of the public thought that if scientific experts believed that there is some evidence that a group of animals are sentient, we should exercise caution in our treatment of them. This suggests that, at least in the UK, the public support is there for including these animals. Insofar as legislation recognising animal sentience is regarded as the result of consultation with scientific experts, it also weakly suggests that it may lead people to believe that we should be more careful in our treatment of them. Though a study more directly trying to compare the influence of sentience legislation on public opinion after it has been passed, would be more valuable in assessing its impact.","text",51
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","More concretely, it may also serve as an impetus for some legislation protecting the welfare of these animals. Unlike the sentience of larger animals, the sentience of invertebrates has not even been implicitly recognised and there is no real legal rationale for legislation to protect them prior to this recognition. This may mean that it is substantially more likely that this legislation will cause real change because it represents a real change in political attitudes, rather than an overdue admission of a change in political attitudes. If the UK government implements some of the recommendations in the Review of the Evidence of Sentience in Cephalopod Molluscs and Decapod Crustaceans(2021), this will be a clear case of sentience legislation causing further, more concrete animal protection legislation.","text",52
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","If this is right that legislation recognising the sentience of invertebrates (or other more disputed cases) is indeed particularly valuable, that may provide an argument for sentience legislation in general, since the sentience of larger animals must presumably be recognised first and in doing so a conversation can be raised about which animals to include.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Another important aspect that could result from sentience legislation is support for a focus on the positive dimension of welfare. Standard definitions of sentience include the ability to experience positive welfare as well as negative welfare. This is significant because almost all existing animal welfare legislation concerns only reducing the amount of negative welfare experienced, rather than allowing animals to experience positive welfare. If this positive dimension of sentience began to be taken seriously, and inspire new legislation to cover for this dramatic oversight, this could greatly improve the value of this legislation(Ferrere 2022). Unfortunately, we have not yet seen significant precedents of this happening, so this outcome remains speculative.","text",55

For this reason, we focused on a number of case studies for this report to try and assess: 1) the tractability of implementing the legislation, 2) any direct effects associated with the legislation, and 3) the broader consequences of the legislation, including subsequent animal welfare legislation or court decisions that may be attributable to the sentience legislation.","text",57
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Nevertheless, there is some difficulty in assessing 3), since the most progressive countries for animal welfare are likely to pass legislation recognising the sentience of animals, as well as a variety of other more comprehensive laws. It might therefore look like the legislation recognising the sentience of animals caused the comprehensive legislation, while in actual fact both were simply the result of the country being more progressive on animal welfare.

In 1994, this petition was accepted by the European Parliament(Rowanet al.2021). This led to the Treaty of Amsterdam(European Communities 1997)recognising animal sentience at the EU level for the first time. The entire section of this treaty concerning animal sentience and welfare reads:","text",60

"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","The strength of this legislation was put to the test in 2001 when, in response to the hoof and mouth disease pandemic, the EU issued a directive banning the use of preventative vaccinations, and instead mandating the slaughter of these animals. When this decision was contested on the grounds that respect for the sentience of these animals should mean that they can only be slaughtered when it is absolutely necessary, the European Court of Justice ruled that the animal welfare protocol recognising sentience was not meant to institute any principles and EU law, it was just meant to codify existing principles. It is possible that the judge ruled irregularly and future judges will rule differently, but as it stands, this amounts to an admission that the EU animal sentience legislation is purely symbolic, and just a kind of window dressing on existing animal welfare policies(Pedersen 2009).","text",63

During its membership of the EU, the UK received animal sentience legislation as a result of the Treaty of Amsterdam (1997). After leaving, since EU legislation would no longer be in force in the UK, the UK decided to adopt much of the existing EU legislation into UK legislation.

There was a public backlash in response to this which prompted the Conservative party to reconsider this, and in 2019, a group of 50 animal advocacy organisations formed a coalition called Better Deal For Animals to push for UK legislation to match the EU legislation recognising animal sentience(Rowanet al.2021).

This makes the recognition of their sentience relatively symbolic so far, but since this is a recent development, it will be important to see if they are later included in the Animal Welfare Act (2006) or other legislation, as the government-commissioned report recommends. If they are later included in the Animal Welfare Act this could be a case of sentience legislation leading to more clear benefits for animals, since the Animal Welfare Act includes more specific and concrete protections for animals.","text",71

The government has said that sentience will not take priority over other considerations when formulating legislation, but this is still very significant(Ares n.d.).

In several cases, the Oregon state Supreme Court has ruled that, since animals are individual sentient beings, cases where multiple animals are harmed are treated as multiple infractions of the law, rather than a single case(Kotzmann and Stonebridge 2021).

"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Concluding his article, Lessard writes:","text",98
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","“In sum, judges transformed what could have been a simple declaratory recognition of animal sentience and biological needs into a provision with normative force. Within a few years, sentience recognition evolved into sentience protection. To be sure, this normative force does not prevent humans from exploiting and killing animals on a daily basis. However, it does ensure that harm is done with some respect for animal sentience and biological needs. In other words, Québec law frankly acknowledges that humans may legally use other sentient beings, but it compels them to use a certain amount of respect while recognizing the special bonds humans develop with animals”(Lessard 2021).","text",99
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","The court of appeal of Québec has confirmed that animal sentience legislation in the province is more than just symbolic. They say that the legislation dictates that people should not cause pain to animals and that regulations must also be designed to protect animals from pain(Lessard 2021). However, it is not clear from this statement if this goes beyond other animal protection legislation in other areas, which also typically requires the minimization of pain.","text",100

"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Despite these victories and the promising wording of the animal sentience legislation, not a great deal has changed for animals so far(Ferrere 2022). These victories are notable as exceptions – the situation for animals has otherwise remained the same. Kotzmann(2022)characterises the time following the passage of this legislation as a crossroads, with potential for either great change on behalf of animals in the future or with the continuation of the status quo of very little protection in practice.","text",102
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Sometimes legislation recognising animal sentience is less symbolic and more explicit details or partner legislation are included spelling out direct intended implications. This is most true in the case of the UK, which will have an animal sentience committee tasked with making sure that the government pays due regard to the sentience of animals(Kotzmann 2020).","text",103
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","The recognition of animals as sentient beings certainly seems to be a step away from their treatment by the law as objects. However, in many cases animal sentience legislation in a country or area coexists with legislation that continues to regard them as objects. In practice, they have a kind of uneasy ‘dual status’(Kotzmann 2020).","text",104
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","One thing to keep in mind is that this kind of judicial pushing at the edges is more difficult in countries with civil codes of law (because it relies on judges taking more initiative in interpreting the law), meaning that the solution may not be able to be effectively implemented everywhere(Kempers 2022).","text",105
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","CRUCIAL CONSIDERATIONS","text",106
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Does sentience legislation do enough to protect animals from killing and exploitation?","text",107
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Lessard(2021)brings up a concern with animal sentience legislation, which is that it may not do enough to prevent the killing and exploitation of animals, so long as it is done “painlessly”. It may allow killing because sentience legislation primarily points to a hedonic conception of well-being, which could in principle allow painless killing. Views that assign extra moral significance to killing or death (such as preference satisfaction views) or views that exploitation is intrinsically morally problematic would object to this.","text",108
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","The strongest validation of this concern is the Québec case of defending a decision to euthanise a stray dog for being a “nuisance”. As discussed earlier, this decision was defended on the grounds that the recognition of sentience does not preclude an animal being euthanised when other interests are at stake. This represents the Québec judicial system in practice giving very little moral consideration to the sentience of animals by weighting its importance lower than minor interests of humans.","text",109
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","However, there is at least a theoretical justification for respect for sentience translating into some protection for their lives and protection from exploitation. As long as an animal’s life is worth living, hedonic views would prohibit killing them because their life is expected to contain more happiness than suffering. Since a hedonic view would also require people to give animals a life worth living in the first place, after that is done, it would then prohibit them from painlessly killing those animals(Višak 2013).","text",110
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","It is also difficult to imagine economically feasible use of animals that truly minimises suffering and gives them a life worth living that is still exploitative towards them. If this is not possible, then a duty to respect their sentience would also protect them from exploitation.","text",111
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","The problem may therefore be less with the implication of this policy, and more with convenient interpretations of it. That is to say, the problem may be that a simple reading of policy could be seen to support “painless” killing and continued exploitation. In the worst case, such a policy could be used to provide cover for these continued practices on the grounds that animals are being respected by the sentience legislation. It remains to be seen if other jurisdictions will rule similarly to the Québec case or if they will see sentience as implying broader protections than this.","text",112
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","However, the fact that a single piece of legislation does not cover all morally relevant cases of harm is not a good argument against it. As with civil rights victories, it is most likely that animal protection legislation will come step-by-step and future legislation can cover for weaknesses in previous legislation(Kempers 2022).","text",113
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Vagueness","text",114
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Ferrere(2022)argues that the fact that sentience is typically not defined in the legislation recognising it poses a significant problem to the value of this legislation. He claims that a judge would be unlikely to proceed with provocative interpretation of the legislation, an interpretation that would affect lives or livelihoods, if the term is not clearly defined.","text",115
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Not being anchored to a current definition of the term means that the effect of this legislation may change over time with new interpretations of these terms. This may be beneficial if we expect progress on attitudes towards animals, as a more favourable definition may be used, but it could also open a window to backsliding to a more aggressive definition of sentience. Overall, we think progress is more likely and so we view this aspect of the vagueness concern as being potentially positive.","text",116
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Humane washing","text",117
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Trøite and Myskja(2018)examines the case of the Norwegian Animal Protection Act (2009), which recognises the intrinsic value of animals in what they suggest is a purely symbolic way. They argue that there is a risk that using words in a way contrary to their normal meaning undermines that meaning, which could have long-term political significance. The same argument would apply to animal sanctions legislation, suggesting that their symbolic use could undermine the strength and political significance of these terms.","text",118
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","This could be viewed as a form of “humane washing”, where current exploitative practices are shrouded in a veneer of being high welfare, potentially leading to complacency with the current status quo(Scott-Reid 2021). In this case, people may take psychological refuge in the fact that the legislation respects animals, without any real benefit for animals. If people can receive all the moral acclaim associated with recognising the sentience of animals, without having to change their actions, they will not have any additional reason to change their actions to improve the situation of animals. It is therefore at least important to make sure that people who only say the right words do not receive the same moral acclaim as people who actively help animals.","text",119
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Of course, this case may only be a reflection or symptom of the dramatically inconsistent attitudes towards animals in our society. We cherish some animals as beloved companions, whilst raising others in horrific conditions(Francione 2004). Because this is already common, symbolic sentience legislation may not be entrenching an attitude that is not already present. It may therefore represent less of a risk than would otherwise be expected.","text",120
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Trøite and Myskja(2018)note that this concern must be balanced against the potential for the legislation to lead to change. People can recognise the inconsistency between the lofty language of the legislation and current practice, and this can bolster campaigns or legal challenges to current practices by allowing them to point out this hypocrisy.","text",121
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Ultimately, we do not think this consideration is decisive against the value of sentience legislation. Moral progress appears to mostly come step-by-step, and we cannot always expect significant actions to follow words from the onset. Nevertheless, we should push as much as possible so that the legislation is not purely symbolic. Fortunately, sentience legislation itself provides an important tool for doing so, since it allows us to point out the inconsistency and hold people accountable for their commitments in legislation.","text",122
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","CONCLUSION AND REMAINING UNCERTAINTIES","text",123
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","An assessment of the value of animal sentience legislation is difficult because any significant benefits for animals from the legislation lie well into the future. We see some potential in the legislation in enabling future activism and judicial challenges, as well as potentially prompting future legislative change. We can envisage how this might play into a theory of victory ultimately leading to fundamental rights, though it also seems like it is not strictly necessary in this pathway. We view the legislation as generally shifting the conversation with government in a more promising direction, though since sentience is already implicitly recognised in many jurisdictions, this may not be a large shift.","text",124
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","We remain most impressed by the results seen in the UK, where an animal sentience committee was established (though this has now been compromised by the choice of committee chair) and the sentience of decapod crustaceans and cephalopods was recognised with potential for further legislation to protect them. The best case scenario for an organisation may be replicating this result in another country, but with stronger sentience committee appointments.","text",125
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","On the other hand, if organisations are only able to establish the relatively toothless legislation seen in the EU and New Zealand, we are not convinced that this is among the strongest possible campaigns for that organisation. The argument that this legislation represents humane washing is a significant concern, but we are not convinced that this makes the campaign overall negative, as long as organisations pressure the government on this point to make it more than just symbolic.","text",126
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","Our most significant remaining uncertainty is just our overall assessment of the impact of legislation that has not yet seen significant direct impact on the lives of animals. Since this legislation is relatively new in many jurisdictions, it will be important to monitor the situation and note whether it leads to significant further improvements for animals. It will be especially important to monitor the case of the UK, as that represents what is so far the strongest version of this ask.","text",127
"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals","One interesting avenue that we did not explore is examining potential historical parallels to sentience legislation – legislation that appears only symbolic – and see if it ultimately contributed to any concrete outcomes.","text",128

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","The animal advocacy movement regularly invests resources into campaigns that aim to reduce people's consumption of meat and/or animal products. Many of these campaigns are conducted using digital media (e.g. social media ads) and/or mass media (e.g. radio, TV, newspapers).","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","In this report, we summarise the evidence on these campaigns. We conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis, drawing on the high-quality scientific studies that have been published over the past few years. This report builds on previous analyses of meat-reduction campaigns, which have been published by various researchers over the past decade. Our cost-effectiveness analysis focuses on what additional funding could achieveon the margin, ignoring fixed costs that are already being paid by existing animal advocacy organisations.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","We address three main questions. These questions, and our current view on them, are as follows:","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","What impact might these campaigns have on the lives of animals? Given the scientific evidence we have available, our best guess is that these campaigns spare 3.7 animals per dollar. There is significant variance in our estimate - it is very possible that the campaigns actually have 0 impact, and it is somewhat possible that the campaigns have an impact that is several times higher than our best-guess estimate. Our best-guess estimate is in rough agreement with the cost-effectiveness estimated by previous researchers. We erred towards the conservative side when producing our calculations, so there are several important choices we made with which reasonable researchers could disagree.","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","Should the animal advocacy movement change the amount of resources invested in these campaigns? Based on our calculations, this campaign does not appear supremely cost-effective. On the other hand, the absolute impact of this campaign (3.7 animals per dollar) is quite reasonable, and the evidence base supporting this campaign is quite strong.","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","Could mass media campaigns in developing countries be a particularly impactful opportunity for these campaigns? We believe that radio and mass media campaigns in developing countries can justifiably form part of the movement's overall portfolio of outreach campaigns for meat reduction. However, we do not think it would be justified to put a disproportionately high amount of the movement's resources into radio campaigns in developing countries.","text",17
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","Could we create a win-win by jointly funding meat-reduction campaigns with climate-motivated funders? We find that climate funders (at least the funders strictly interested in climate and motivated primarily by cost-effectiveness) would not be keen to put large amounts of resources towards meat-reduction campaigns, even as a joint initiative. The reason is that meat-reduction campaigns appear to be a less cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions than other options available to the climate movement.","text",18
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","Our conclusions are based on our cost-effectiveness analysis in which we calculated the expected number of fewer animals farmed per dollar spent on advertising (animals/USD). We calculated this for each of four different scenarios. We also produce rough upper and lower bounds to accompany our point estimates. The results are as follows:","text",19
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","Best-guess. This is our main scenario, and we think this scenario is the most likely of our four scenarios (~45%). Under this scenario, we estimate that meat-reduction outreach campaigns spare 3.7 animals/USD (-0.7 to 8.7).","text",20
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","Optimistic (but still plausible). This scenario optimistically assumes that meat-reduction advertisements are slightly more frequent (than in our best-guess estimate) at convincing people to reduce their meat intake. We think this scenario is plausible, but somewhat unlikely (~10%). Under this scenario, we estimate that meat-reduction outreach campaigns spare 9.1 animals/USD (5.3 to 13.6).","text",21
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","Optimistic + cheap + long-lasting (but still plausible). This scenario assumes a longer duration of diet change and a cheaper cost-per-engagement. We think this scenario is plausible, but unlikely (~5%). Under this scenario, we estimate that meat-reduction outreach campaigns spare 84.8 animals/USD (50.1 to 127.3).","text",22
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","Pessimistic (but still plausible). This scenario simply assumes that the effect of the intervention is zero. As Mathur et al(1)argue, many of the diet-change experiments are subject to various weaknesses (e.g. desirability biases). This means that a true effect of zero remains a real possibility(2). We think this scenario is somewhat likely (~40%). Under this scenario, we estimate that meat-reduction outreach campaigns spare 0 animals/USD.","text",23
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","Overall, our best guess is that meat-reduction outreach campaigns spare roughly 3.7 animals/USD. But there is a really good chance (our gut feel says a ~40% chance) that these campaigns have 0 impact, and there is a small chance (our gut feel says a ~15% chance) that the impact is several times larger than our best-guess. About 90% of this benefit comes from chickens and farmed fish. If you assume a typical lifespan of ~6 weeks for chickens and perhaps a bit longer for farmed fish, our best-guess estimate would correspond to roughly ~5 animal-months spared per dollar.","text",24
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","Our best-guess estimate suggests that meat reduction campaigns are somewhat less effective (~one-sixth as effective) as what previous cost-effectiveness analyses have concluded. Our analysis draws on a stronger evidence base than some previous analyses. We also make some assumptions and choices that tend to err on the conservative side, so reasonable people could conclude that the point estimate should be higher than we have concluded. We emphasise that there is plenty of variance across our four scenarios that capture the possibility for a more optimistic view.","text",25
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","Based on this analysis, we do not think that there is much reason for the animal advocacy movement to invest a substantially higher amount of resources into these campaigns.","text",26
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","The movement will probably continue funding these campaigns at roughly thecurrentlevel of investment for the foreseeable future. So, it is probably worthwhile for the movement to fund a few more studies following the recommendations made by Mathur et al in the conclusion to their recent experimental report(2). In that report, Mathur et al found that the existing studies may be systematically overestimating the effects of meat-reduction campaigns, and they recommended that experimental studies be conducted in a way that measures actual consumption with a sufficient sample size while minimising social desirability bias.","text",27
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","On the other hand, we have mainly discussed the evidence for one-off interventions. In these interventions, participants see a message or advertisement only one time. However, it is also possible for campaigns to use mass media with the intention of showing the same message to each person multiple times. Repeat exposure might have a larger effect size than one-off exposure.","text",28

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","In this report, we use ""meat-reduction outreach"" and ""outreach for meat reduction"" as umbrella terms to capture any campaign that seeks to reduce or eliminate people's consumption of meat and/or animal products. These campaigns could ask people to reduce their intake of meat and/or animal products (reducetarian), to eliminate meat entirely (vegetarian), and/or to reduce meat and animal products entirely (vegan). For simplicity, we often use the term ""meat"" as shorthand for ""meat and animal products"".","text",51
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","The diagram below shows the theory of change for the main causal pathway of these campaigns. The animal advocacy movement creates and publishes meat-reduction advertisements on digital or mass media platforms. These advertisements attract engagement by meat-eaters, which (in principle) causes an increase in the number of meat-eaters who reduce or eliminate their consumption of meat and animal products. This causes the demand of meat and animal products to decrease, which (in principle) causes the supply to decrease too. As a result, fewer animals are farmed.","text",52

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","Elasticity: economic dynamics cause the magnitude of the impact of eating less meat to be decreased by a modest proportion. The concern with elasticity is that if there are more vegans, then meat could become cheaper to buy, which could encourage other people to buy more meat, thus potentially cancelling out any benefits. The best exploration of this question that we have found was published by Lusk and Bailey Norwood(4)and summarised by Tomasik(5)and by Barrett and Raskoff(6). As Barrett and Raskoff express these results: ""in the United States, for a sufficiently large number n, if n choices are made not to buy a chicken, 0.76n fewer chickens will be produced(6)."" The corresponding numbers for other products are 0.91 for eggs, 0.74 for pork, 0.69 for veal, 0.68 for beef, and 0.56 for milk(5). As such, these economic effects might slightly reduce the impact of eating vegan, but only by a small amount (e.g. 24% for eating less chicken).","text",63
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","Threshold effects: we believe that threshold effects have a negligible effect on impact. The concern with threshold effects is that, sure, one person can go vegan, but will that one person be the one to cause the supermarket to purchase less meat from their supplier, and for farms to produce fewer animals(7)? Just how sensitive are supply chains? While there is some debate about threshold effects and the expected impact of veganism(7), such debates are less important for our case. In the present report, we are not thinking about one individual going vegan, but rather convincing many people to go vegan at the same time. What matters to us is not the effect of one additional vegan, but the effect of many additional vegans. Barrett and Raskoff(6)state that the argument ""that vegans have a hugecollectiveimpact on reducing animal suffering"" is ""uncontroversial"", and that ""At least over the long run, the animal agriculture industry is sensitive to macrolevel market trends—for example, to large numbers of individuals refraining from chicken.""","text",64

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","Over the past couple of decades, there have been many experimental studies that aim to measure whether outreach campaigns cause people to reduce their intake of meat and animal products. These studies have also been examined in a couple of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.","text",67
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","The key study that guides our understanding is the systematic review by Mathur et al(1). The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 100 studies that tested the effects of messages on meat consumption. This review did not focus specifically on digital advertising, and messages focused on animal welfare rather than environmental or health concerns, but the immense volume of data makes it a high-quality piece of evidence nevertheless. The authors found that ""the interventions appeared consistently beneficial at least in the short term and with outcomes primarily based on self-reported behaviour or intended behaviour, on average increasing by 22% an individual’s probability of intending, self-reporting, or behaviorally demonstrating low versus high meat consumption."" This estimate was lower when the authors included only studies with longer follow-up times (e.g. 7+ days) and/or when the authors included only studies that measured self-reported or observed consumption, rather than intended consumption. When both of these limitations are applied, the corresponding estimate is about 9% (i.e., outreach increases by 9% an individual’s probability of intending, self-reporting, or behaviorally demonstrating low versus high meat consumption). In our model (see below, ""Our cost-effectiveness analysis""), this corresponds to the intervention causing around 4.5% of people to decrease their meat consumption. The danger of backfiring (people eatingmoremeat after seeing messages) appeared rare. The authors point out that the studies in the review often used self-reported behavioural measures, which can lead to desirability bias, and that most studies only looked at meat consumption in the short-term (a month or less).","text",68
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","To complement our understanding, we also draw on the systematic review by Chang et al(8). This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of 31 studies on reducing meat consumption, specifically in university/college settings. The estimate from this meta-analysis is closely consistent with the estimate from Mathur et al (see below, ""Reality checks""). The authors did not find significant differences in the effects of intervention in meat consumption between studies that used long vs. short follow-up times.","text",69
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","One of the key findings from Mathur et al's systematic review was that many experimental studies were at risk of desirability bias. This may be causing us to think that the ability for outreach to reduce people's meat intake (e.g. the 4.5% estimate we mentioned above) is larger than it actually is - we may be overestimating the effect size. So, Mathur et al(2)subsequently conducted an experimental study that explicitly aimed to understand this desirability bias. This study focused on documentaries, which may be less applicable for digital media campaigns. However, this study is particularly informative because the authors explicitly conducted different trials to see whether results differed when the experimental setup minimised desirability bias. The conclusion is particularly illuminating: ""In a study designed to minimize social desirability bias [...] we found that the documentary did not affect participants’ reported consumption 12 days after random assignment [...] However, in a second study with less protection against social desirability bias [...] the documentary did substantially increase the percentage of participants who immediately intended to reduce consumption."" This provides evidence that the academic literature may be overestimating the number of people who eat less meat after being exposed to information.","text",70
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","To summarise, there is strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that digital media campaigns may lead to people eating less meat. However, due to methodological limitations, such as social desirability bias, such campaignsmaybe somewhat less effective than previous research studies would suggest.","text",71
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","In terms of the cost for running online meat reduction campaigns, the most relevant piece of information is a recent experiment of animal rights video advertisements on Facebook(9). In a group of developed countries (Australia, Canada, the UK, New Zealand, and the USA), the costs per engagement were as follows: USD 0.0009 per impression (when the advertisement was shown to a Facebook user); USD 0.0029 per video play (when users played the video for at least 15 seconds); USD 0.0096 per video play (when users played the video for 50% of its duration, i.e. around 50 seconds); USD 0.03 per video play (95% of its duration, i.e. around 1 minute 30 seconds); and USD 0.56 per reaction (e.g. when the user makes a like, love, or sad reaction to the video on Facebook). In a group of developing countries (Angola, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Nigeria, Rwanda), the corresponding costs per engagement for each of those same categories were as follows: USD 0.00011, 0.00032, 0.0012, 0.0041, and 0.031 respectively.

A risk ratio of 1.11 means that people who are exposed to the intervention, compared to people not exposed to the intervention, have an 11% higher probability of self-reporting or behaviourally demonstrating a lower meat consumption.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","There are strong theoretical reasons to expect this number to be 50% - if you measure meat consumption as a point on a quantitative scale (i.e. you ignore the probability that the meat consumption of a meat-eater will be exactly identical at two points in time) and assume that there are no enormous trends in meat consumption by the population as a whole, then we would expect the baseline population (people not exposed to the intervention) to be divided into ~50% meat increases and ~50% decreases by chance alone. This is supported by our analysis of data from dietary change studies for people in the control groups: in the data from Schwitzgebel et al(11), the percentage of people in the control group who decreased their meat consumption was 49%; for Jalil et al(12), 45%; and for Macdonald et al(13), 49%.

We produced two alternative estimates, based instead on our analysis of the data from two other experimental studies. The data from Macdonald et al(13)would suggest an estimate of 49%, and the data from Schwitzgebel et al(11)would suggest 52%. Our estimate is certainly on the conservative side, though all three estimates are within the same order of magnitude. There is no real reason to favour one estimate over the others, aside from intuitions about the quality and generalisability of each of these three experimental studies and the real-world implications of each estimate. In real-world terms, for somebody who eats meat two times every day, a reduction of 16% would mean eating meat at around two or three fewer meals per week. Assuming an average decrease larger than this strikes us as intuitively unrealistic.","text",124

The corresponding estimates would be ~9% and ~23%, respectively. This would suggest that we could be underestimating the true effect size by a factor of ~10x to ~20x. Nevertheless, there are many reasons to expect that the true effect would be smaller than what these experimental studies predict (e.g. our intervention of online ads or perhaps short videos being far less intensive than hour-long lectures; many reasons for caution that were expressed in Mathur et al 2021's meta-analysis and adopted in our model).

Again, these are not really independent, as many of these analyses were based on the results of studies that also form part of our evidence base.

Our overall point estimate of ~3.7 animals helped per dollar is very similar to the magnitude of estimates that have been produced previously. The corresponding estimate from Animal Charity Evaluators(26)was between 3 and 10 animals per dollar; from Animal Charity Evaluators(27)was 3.4 animals per dollar; and from Wildeford(28)was 3.1 animals per dollar. Likewise, our estimate corresponds to ~166 animal-days per dollar, compared to the ~120 animal-days per dollar calculated by Tomasik(29).

The only estimate in the table below that corresponds to online advertisements comes from the study by ACE (~2016-2019)(27). The original source for the cost-per-engagement in that study was ACE's evaluation of The Humane League's (THL) online advertisements for diet change, factory farming, and other topics. The spreadsheet supporting this analysis is availablehere, though the spreadsheet has since been updated for the 2023 analysis. In that spreadsheet, ACE calculates that the cost per person reached by THL's online ads are, in fact, either USD 0.007 or USD 0.345. The costs vary between the THL's campaigns. The cost that we use in our model (USD 0.03, based on the Facebook experiment detailed above) is well within this range. Therefore, we are comfortable with using our estimate of USD 0.03, even despite the different estimates produced by ACE.","text",131
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","Duration of diet change. We use 1 year (increased to 3 years in one of our modelled scenarios). This parameter is subject to a large amount of uncertainty. The evidence for this input is pretty sparse - some people think this input should be lower (e.g. a few months), and some higher (e.g. 3-4 years or more). We guess ~1 year, and we think anything lower than this is probably too pessimistic. We suspect that effects could even last ~3 years, but the evidence is too tentative to have a super high amount of confidence in this. Jalil et al(12)show that the effects can persist even after 3 years, though that study involved a long lecture rather than a short video. The meta-analysis by Mathur et al(1)(see Figure S5 in that study) doesn't really show a decline in the effect over time, at least beyond the first 7 days. That said, the studies analysed by Mathur et al have, at most, follow-up times of a few months. Similarly, the meta-analysis by Chang et al(8)found no statistically significant effect of the follow-up time on the effect size. When thinking about vegetarianism specifically, Animal Charity Evaluators(30)concluded ""that the authors' ""final 90% [subjective confidence interval] of the mean length of vegetarianism period for use in cost-effectiveness estimates of veg*n advocacy is 2.5–6.5 years."" The weakness of this estimate is that vegetarianism is different (and involves more of a conscious and public commitment) than simply reducing meat intake.","text",132

In our model, we find that the intervention causes about ~4.5% of peoplewho engage with the intervention(e.g. people who click on the ad)to change their behaviour. In contrast, Kaufman(31)argued that expecting even ~1% of people to change their behaviour because of the intervention is unrealistic. Our figure of ~4.5% is derived from applying our risk ratio of 1.09 to a baseline probability of 50% (this is explained in detail above). The divergence in opinion here could arise from the fact that Kaufman was referring to ~1% of people who are handed a leaflet, while we're talking about ~4.5% of peoplewho click on an ad. On the other hand, online ads could be less impactful than average when compared to all of the different interventions in the meta-analysis, many of which were quite involved (e.g. university lectures).","text",133

We believe that this position is no longer justified. For example, the experimental study by Jalil et al(12)found that when people ate less beef, they ""switched from beef towards veg, rather than to poultry + fish"". Similarly, the meta-analysis by Mathur et al(1)found that mean increases in meat consumption were quite rare, though this could mask instances where poultry increases but total meat consumption still decreases.","text",134

For these reasons, we would expect that a new animal advocacy organisation established to work on digital media campaigns may experience less reach than THL does currently, particularly as the new organisation scales. Nevertheless, if we assume that reaching people on social media does cause people to eat less meat, then the case of THL shows that investing in digital media may be a cheap way to have a large impact on the lives of animals.","text",142

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","One specific way to deliver meat-reduction outreach campaigns is to use mass media (including radio, TV, newspapers, and the internet) in developing countries. Mass media campaigns have been in a variety of contexts to achieve human behavioural change(36–43). These contexts include campaigns to prevent smoking, to encourage contraceptive use, to encourage healthier eating, among other uses. Such a campaign might be most promising in developing countries, as radio appears to be a particularly cost-effective delivery method for such a campaign(42). This raises the question: could radio and other forms of mass media in developing countries be a particularly cost-effective way to deliver outreach campaigns for meat reduction?","text",144
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","There is little evidence concerning the effectiveness of using radio and other forms of mass media for the specific task of reducing meat and animal production consumption in developing countries. The best evidence comes from the experiment, which we discussed above, that measured the cost per engagement for vegan advocacy videos in developed and developing countries(9). In the developing countries targeted in the experiment (Angola, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Nigeria, Rwanda), advertisements were about 7 - 9 times as effective as in developed countries. However, the author also points out that meat consumption per capita in the developing countries is around one-eighth that in the developed countries.","text",145

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","Mass media campaigns can increase people's consumption of healthy food(36,37), including in developing countries(38). Numerous review studies have also concluded that mass media seems generally effective in changing people's health-related behaviours(36–43). This effect holds across a variety of contexts, including in numerous developing countries(41). Some studies have also found that this effect holds for mass media campaigns that seek to increase people's intake of fruits and vegetables(36–38). Notably, there is some suggestion that the influence of mass media has begun to decrease, as mobile phones overtake mass media as a key source of information in people's lives(41)- if true, this would also mean that the cost-effectiveness of mass media campaigns has also begun to decrease.","text",147
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","Campaignsin generalcan reduce people's consumption of animal products, including in developing countries. The meta-analysis by Mathur et al(1)included a handful of studies from developing countries (specifically China, Ecuador, and India). These studies mostly had positive effect sizes of a comparable magnitude to the other studies included in the meta-analysis. These studies used a few different interventions, which were pretty close in form and content to short ads shown on the internet or TV (e.g. images or short videos). None of these studies tested interventions delivered through radio specifically. Separately, a population-level modelling study found that vegetarian and vegan outreach campaigns in general can increase population-level rates of vegetarianism and veganism(44). However, this study focused on the UK, so it is unclear whether this finding would also apply to developing countries. And this study did not consider campaigns in general, but campaigns delivered via mass media specifically.","text",148

There may be barriers that make mass media campaigns less effective at the specific task of reducing meat and animal production consumption in developing countries, such as cultural or social factors. One important consideration is much of the existing literature on mass media campaigns cover campaigns that are clearly in the interest of the people who the outreach is aimed at. Meat-reduction outreach may have some health benefits for the people receiving the outreach, but the improvement is less clear than in some other cases, and the animal welfare and environmental benefits of eating less meat are not themselves realised by the people whose diet changes. This might mean that the evidence on mass media outreach for health-related behaviour change is not applicable to meat-reduction advocacy campaigns.","text",149
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","This evidence gap also means that we cannot reliably predict whether, or by how much, the cost-effectiveness of meat-reduction outreach campaigns would change relative to the baseline cost-effectiveness for meat-reduction outreach that we estimated in this report.","text",150

Jalil et al(12)suggest, from a climate perspective, that reducing meat consumption is one way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This could mean that funders from the animal advocacy movement and the climate movement could jointly fund meat reduction campaigns, and such funding would have two effects: the funding would spare animals, and the funding would reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","What impact might these campaigns have on the lives of animals? Given the scientific evidence we have available, our best guess is that these campaigns spare 3.7 animals per dollar. There is significant variance in our estimate - it is very possible that the campaigns actually have 0 impact, and it is somewhat possible that the campaigns have an impact that is several times higher than our best-guess estimate. Our best-guess estimate would indicate that these campaigns are roughly as impactful as previous researchers have concluded. We erred towards the conservative side when producing our calculations, so there are several important choices we made with which reasonable researchers could disagree.","text",164
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-reduction-how-much-can-digital-media-and-mass-media-help","Should the animal advocacy movement change the amount of resources invested in these campaigns?

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","A meat tax is one policy that can reduce meat consumption. This policy has some key advantages: there is strong economic evidence that such a tax would reduce meat consumption while, depending on the type of meat tax, a campaign could also take advantage of the momentum provided by the environmental and health movements.","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","However, a meat tax also suffers from a substantial risk. As the price of meat increases, consumers may switch from eating beef to instead eating chicken and fish. This could cause an overall increase in the total number of animals killed for food each year. This risk is highly plausible, considering that environmental- and health-motivated policies would likely place higher taxes on beef than chicken or fish. This risk is also difficult to predict in advance, even if the details of the meat tax policy were known. Furthermore, public support for a meat tax is very low.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","For these reasons, we do not recommend a meat tax as a campaign for animal advocacy organisations. Instead, we encourage organisations to choose an alternative campaign that has a more robust and favourable base of evidence.","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","INTRODUCTION TO THE MEAT TAX","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Motivated to address the immense suffering of animals in the agriculture industry, many animal advocacy organisations seek to campaign for government policies to reduce meat consumption. One policy that has been proposed by these organisations is a meat tax. A meat tax would involve a government levying a tax on the purchase of some or all animal-derived food products, including meat, dairy, and eggs(Arvidsson, 2016; de Graad, 2020). A meat tax is currently an area of active campaigning by PETA¹. It has also been strongly recommended by the bookMeatonomics(Simon, 2013)and there appears to be support for it among other animal advocacy organisations(Simmonds and Vallgårda, 2021). A campaign for a meat tax would take advantage of the momentum provided by these environmental and health organisations who have proposed meat taxes(Briggset al., 2016; Springmann, Mason-D’Croz,et al., 2018; FAIRR, 2020). A meat tax could bring benefits to farmed animals, but it also carries some serious  risks. We will discuss these benefits and risks in detail below.","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Note that this document focuses on the potential for a meat tax in the UK. Most of the public discussions and academic analyses of meat taxes have taken place in Western Europe, and animal advocacy organisations in the UK have expressed interest in campaigning for a meat tax. However, many of our findings will be readily applicable to other countries.","text",17
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","THEORY OF CHANGE","text",18
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","The effects of a meat tax on animal suffering are visualised in the following flowchart. By encouraging the government to establish a tax on meat and animal products, this campaign would increase the cost of these products. Following standard economic theory, an increase in cost would cause a decrease in the demand for meat, and consequently its consumption. However, a greater increase in cost for beef or red meat (which would occur for an emissions- or health-focused tax) would also cause consumers to substitute away from beef or red meat towards cheaper meat (e.g. chicken, fish). This means that the consumption of some types of meat would decrease, but the consumption of others might increase. Therefore, whilst a meat tax is likely to decrease the number of farmed cows and sheep, this may be offset by a larger increase in the number of farmed chickens, pigs, and fish. For this reason, it is highly uncertain whether a meat tax would, overall, benefit or harm animals. This possibility is discussed in detail throughout this report.","text",19
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","The following flowchart visualises this theory of change, based on the economic evidence and modelling studies discussed in this report.","text",20
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","EVIDENCE FOR THE THEORY OF CHANGE","text",21
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","There is strong evidence from economic theory and modelling studies that a meat tax could reduce the consumption of at least some types of meat and animal products. However, note that there is also strong evidence that a meat tax could increase the consumption of other types of meat. This concern is discussed in detail in the ‘Small Animal Replacement Problem’ section below. Empirical studies and historical taxes may provide evidence to support the feasibility of a meat tax, although this evidence appears weaker.","text",22
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Economic theory and modelling studies","text",23
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","The economic theory of a meat tax is straightforward. A meat tax is essentially a tax levied on the purchase of meat and other animal products. Economic theory predicts that a tax on meat would cause the price of meat to increase. This price increase would then trigger a decrease in the demand, and thus consumption, of meat(Arvidsson, 2016). Literature reviews have found that taxes on food decrease the consumption of the foods targeted(Thow, Downs and Jan, 2014; Sacks, Kwon and Backholer, 2021). The magnitude of this decrease depends on price elasticities. As an illustrative example, the own-price elasticity of beef is often calculated to be within an approximate range of -1.3 to -0.5(e.g., Wirsenius, Hedenus and Mohlin, 2011; Abadieet al., 2016). This would suggest that a 1% increase in the price of beef would cause the consumption of beef to decrease by between 0.5% and 1.3%.","text",24
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","In reality, the true decrease in consumption of any product also depends on the prices of other products. To paint a more comprehensive picture of the effects of a meat tax, we can turn to modelling studies. We performed a literature review²to identify studies that modelled the effects of a meat tax. Specifically, we included studies that predicted the effects of a meat tax on the percentage change of consumption of at least one type of meat. Our literature review identified 19 such studies (see Appendix).","text",25
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Crucially, all of these studies estimated that a tax results in a decrease in the consumption of at least some meats and animal products. This provides very strong evidence that a meat tax is capable of reducing the consumption of at least some meat and animal products. There is also strong evidence that a meat tax can increase the consumption of particular food groups - this was common for plant-based foods, but was also observed in some studies for poultry and fish (see ‘Small Animal Replacement Problem’ below). Most of the studies calculated a tax based on greenhouse gas emissions, with health-based taxes forming a minority.","text",26
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","There are six studies that we have included in our own detailed analysis (see Effectiveness Analysis, below). Briggs et al.(2013)modelled the effects of a greenhouse gas emissions tax on the consumption of many meats, non-meat foods, and drinks in the UK. Briggs et al.(2016)performed a very similar analysis, with an updated dataset and additional scenarios. Kehlbacher et al.(2016)considered a similar collection of products in their study on an emissions tax in the UK. Wirsenius et al.(2011)and Jansson and Säll(2018)both focused on the EU, modelling the effects of an emissions tax on meat and animal products. Finally, Revoredo-Giha et al.(2018)concentrated on the UK, considering scenarios ranging from a tax only on beef and veal to a tax on all food products.","text",27
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","The remaining studies have not been included in our detailed analysis either due to a geographic focus outside the UK or a choice of food groups different to the groups we consider in our analysis. (Chalmers et al.(2016)focused on Scotland, but included too few food groups for us to reliably adopt the results.) It is interesting to note that, aside from two global studies and one study on Australia, every study focused on either the EU or a country in Europe. This academic interest in Europe seems to be reflected in the concentration of  political and public discussion on meat taxes in Europe.","text",28

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Real-world empirical data on the effects of meat taxes on meat consumption is extremely limited. This is because no country has yet implemented a meat tax (see ‘Meat Taxes Outside the UK’ below).","text",30
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","However, there is empirical data on the effects of the saturated fat tax in Denmark. This tax increased the price of some meat products in 2011 and 2012. Jensen et al.(2016)performed an empirical analysis of the Danish saturated fat tax, limiting their analysis to minced beef, regular cream, and sour cream. High-fat minced beef was subject to a tax of 16% and saw a decrease in consumption of around 13%. Meanwhile, high-fat regular cream was subject to a tax of 14% and saw a decrease in consumption of around 12%. Finally, high-fat sour cream was subject to a tax of 13% and saw a decrease in consumption of around 9%. It is clear, therefore, that the saturated fat tax affected the price of multiple categories of meat products, and it may be possible for a future empirical study to measure the effects on the consumption of different groups of animals. However, due to the limited data available, the studies that have measured the effect of this tax have not distinguished between different groups of animals(Jensenet al., 2016; Smedet al., 2016).","text",31
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","There is also empirical data produced by experimental studies conducted in laboratories and cafeterias. In a review study for the animal advocacy movement, Harris(2020)found that there is strong evidence that a tax can change behaviour. Likewise, a review by Epstein et al.(2012)concluded that price interventions can change purchasing behaviour in laboratory studies. A conflicting piece of evidence is the cafeteria study by Garnett et al.(2021). In this study, a 10% decrease in price in vegetarian meals and an 8% increase in price in meat-containing meals caused an increase in the purchase of vegetarian meals but no effect on the purchase of meat-containing meals. However, the study setting was a university cafeteria where meals are usually purchased using university cards rather than the students' own money, plausibly affecting purchase decisions. This means that the ability to generalise the results of this study to the general population is limited.","text",32

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Most notably, a piece of legislation enacted in New Zealand in 2020 has signalled an intention to bring agricultural production into the country's Emissions Trading Scheme(FAIRR, 2020; International Carbon Action Partnership, 2021). Specifically, the amendment requires all farms to implement a system for measuring and reporting their greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. This requirement would support the entry of agricultural products into the Emissions Trading Scheme, a world first(FAIRR, 2020; Ministry for Primary Industries, 2021). If agricultural products do become subject to the Scheme, meat production will have to account for the cost of greenhouse gas emissions.","text",35
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Meanwhile in 2019, German politicians proposed increasing the value-added tax on meat from 7% to 19%(Deutsche Welle, 2019). This proposal was uncommon as it seems to have been largely motivated by the desire to improve animal welfare rather than to tackle climate change(Eurogroup for Animals, 2019). In addition, the Danish Council of Ethics⁴(2016)recommended a tax on meat, with an emphasis on beef, but this recommendation was rejected in Parliament(FAIRR, 2017). Looking at Sweden, the government appears to have discussed the possibility of a tax on meat in both 2013 and 2015(Bähr, 2015; Ryan, 2015), though we are unaware of any concrete outcomes. Finally,  there have been some tentative suggestions in the Netherlands that a meat tax may be considered in the future(FAIRR, 2020).","text",36

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","There are several historical examples of taxes implemented in the UK that can be drawn upon as analogies(FAIRR, 2017).","text",39
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","The first is carbon pricing. A recent global meta-analysis found evidence that carbon pricing may have caused only a modest reduction of greenhouse gas emissions(Green, 2021). Nevertheless, that review did conclude that carbon pricing policies seemed particularly effective in the UK.","text",40
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","A second example is tobacco taxation. Taxes on tobacco are an effective way to reduce the prevalence of smoking(Hiscocket al., 2017). However, studies of tobacco taxes in the UK have found that the tobacco industry uses a variety of strategies to undermine the intended effect of these taxes(Hiscocket al., 2017). For example, price manipulation by the industry has led to greater sales of cheap cigarettes over time, limiting the number of people who would otherwise be motivated by higher taxes to quit smoking(Partoset al., 2020). These industry strategies appear to have dampened the effects of tobacco taxation on smoking prevalence in the UK.","text",41
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Our third is the tax on sugary drinks. In discussions on the meat tax in the UK, it is common for people to refer to the UK Soft Drinks Industry Levy(Simmonds and Vallgårda, 2021). Introduced in 2018, this tax on high-sugar drinks, appears to have reduced sugar consumption from soft drinks(Pellet al., 2021). However, the tax was placed on manufacturers and importers(Scarboroughet al., 2020), rather than consumers.The Soft Drinks Industry Levy was also motivated by health. While  this may be partially the same for a meat tax, there is a larger role for both environmental and animal welfare justifications for a meat tax(Simmonds and Vallgårda, 2021). As such, the value of the Soft Drinks Industry Levy as an analogy for a meat tax may be limited.","text",42

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","While there is strong evidence that a meat tax can reduce the farming of some types of animals, there is also evidence that it can increase the farming of others. The small-animal replacement problem (SARP) is a known concern within many policies that aim to reduce meat consumption. Simply put, when people reduce their consumption of some meat products, they may increase their consumption of other meat products(Charity Entrepreneurship, 2018). In particular, people may reduce their consumption of larger animals like cows and sheep but increase their consumption of smaller animals like chickens and fish. The result is that the total number of animals consumed may increase.","text",44
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Compounding this issue is the finding that chickens and fish tend to be farmed under conditions more harmful for their welfare than cows and sheep(Charity Entrepreneurship, 2018; Animal Charity Evaluators, 2020). This trend appears to hold true in the UK(Rioja-Langet al., 2019). Therefore, if people eat fewer cows and sheep but more chickens and fish, the proportion of animals farmed under low-welfare conditions may also increase.","text",45
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Policies are at a particular risk of causing the SARP when they aim to reduce meat consumption for environmental or health reasons. The environmental and health issues associated with the meat of large animals like pigs and cows tend to be more severe than those of small animals, although this varies by context(Godfrayet al., 2018; Climate Change Committee, 2020; Petermann-Rochaet al., 2021; Ritchie, 2021). This is why studies modelling meat taxes focussed on environment or health concerns often predict increases (or smaller decreases) in the consumption of chickens and fish(e.g., Wirsenius, Hedenus and Mohlin, 2011). It is also worth noting that the welfare costs from even a small percentage increase in chicken and fish consumption, by weight, might be much larger than the welfare benefits from a large percentage decrease in cow and sheep consumption. This is because the number of chickens and fish consumed in the UK appears to be several orders of magnitudes higher than the number of cows or sheep(Sanders, 2020).","text",46
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Since the SARP appears to be a significant risk from a meat tax, it would be valuable to know the exact risk. An estimate of the probability that a meat tax would be subject to the SARP would be of great help in deciding whether to campaign for a meat tax. However, this is difficult to establish given that no meat taxes have been implemented. As such, we do not believe it is feasible to make an useful  estimate of this probability while maintaining a strong basis in reality⁵. As Simon(2013)points out in the bookMeatonomics, all economic predictions of the outcome of a meat tax are just predictions, and it is impossible to be certain of the outcome in advance.","text",47
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Nevertheless, studies on a meat tax provide strong evidence that it would be at high risk of causing the SARP. In addition, the risk of the SARP was explicitly raised by one interview participant, an employee of the Vegan Society, in an analysis of the meat tax debate in the UK(Simmonds and Vallgårda, 2021). The modelling study by Briggs et al.(2016)predicted that a meat tax in the UK would cause greater consumption of chickens (10%), fish (3%), and pigs (12%), despite the model also including a tax on meat from those animals. A similar prediction was made by Wirsenius et al.(2011)for the EU, with an increase in the consumption of both chickens (7%) and pigs (1%). Meanwhile, Revoredo-Giha et al.(2018)made similar predictions in their study, though the results varied across the modelled scenarios. In less relevant geographic areas, an increase in the consumption of chickens and fish was predicted in modelling studies by Edjabou and Smed(2013)(Denmark) and Abadie et al.(2016)(Norway). Similarly, Forero-Cantor et al.(2020)observed substitution between meat products in an economic model, concluding that such substitution might limit the environmental benefits of a meat tax.","text",48
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Importantly, there are also several modelling studies that didnotdocument an increase in the consumption of meat or animal products. These include Kehlbacher et al.(2016), Jansson and Säll(2018), Revoredo-Giha et al.(2018)(in some scenarios), and Springmann et al.(2016)(for highly developed countries). Consequently, the SARP is not a guaranteed outcome, but the possibility of its occurrence does mean that a meat tax carries the substantial risk of causing overall harm to animals.","text",49

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","In theory, there are several possible motivations for a meat tax, including reducing damage to the environment and the climate, improving health by reducing the incidence of disease, and reducing animal suffering.","text",51
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Public debate on a meat tax is dominated by concerns related to the environment and health, rather than the needs of animals. Thus, a meat tax may be far more tractable if it is founded in environmental and health arguments. However, studies on these types of meat taxes generally suggest levying a greater tax on beef and lamb compared to fish and chickens. This means that a meat tax justified by environmental or health concerns may be at particular risk of the SARP.","text",52
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","It is much rarer to see proposals for meat taxes motivated by animal suffering justifications. We expect that a meat tax would be far less tractable if justified solely by the desire to reduce animal suffering. However, such a meat tax may be specifically designed to avoid the SARP. Most ambitiously, estimates of the suffering caused per unit of each type of food(e.g., Tomasik, 2018; Orzechowski, 2020)could be used to levy a greater tax on the most harmful products. We have not seen any formal proposals for a tax levied in this way. More commonly, authors arguing for meat taxes draw upon environmental and health justifications alongside animal justifications. This generally leads these authors to propose a flat price increase. For example, Singer(Singer, 2009)proposes a universal 50% increase in the retail price of all meat products, and Simon(2013)proposes a 50% increase in the price of any product that contains any animal-derived ingredients⁶.","text",53
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Risks of the SARP may be exacerbated by the fact that some people advocate for taxing only the meat from large animals. This can be understood as a selective version of health or environmental arguments  and has been proposed or considered by several authors. Bonnet et al.(2018)conclude their modelling study by reporting that ""the most efficient scenario would be to tax only the beef category at a high level since it would allow a 70% reduction in the total variation of GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions…"". Similarly, Wirsenius et al.(2011)conclude their modelling study by reporting that ""most of the effect of a GHG [greenhouse gas] weighted tax on animal food can be captured by taxing the consumption of ruminant meat alone."" Meanwhile, Springmann et al.(2016; 2018)and Revoredo-Giha et al.(2018)explicitly model scenarios where a tax is placed on only red meat, while Kehlbacher et al.(2016)model a scenario where a tax is placed only on foods with above-average emissions, a scenario that excludes poultry and fish. It is reasonable to expect that a meat tax that only increases the price of meat from large animals would encourage people to consume more chicken and fish compared to a tax that also increases the price of chicken and fish. There is little doubt that this would increase the risk of the SARP. Therefore, if only the meat from large animals is taxed, a meat tax may be particularly likely to do more harm than good.","text",54

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","PUBLIC OPINION","text",56
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Several studies have examined public support for a meat tax. One highly relevant source is a report, commissioned by the UK government, called the National Food Strategy(2021). This report detailed many areas of UK food policy, and one policy under consideration was a meat tax. In the small-group ""deliberative dialogues"", the authors report low public support for a meat tax. The authors describe a meat tax as ""politically impossible"" and ""by a long way … the least popular of any measure we discussed with citizens."" A revealing excerpt is as follows:","text",57
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","""The idea of introducing a “meat tax” was a non-starter. Every time we raised it, the atmosphere would suddenly crackle with hostility. Although a minority of our panellists liked the idea, many more were vehemently opposed – and the arguments between these instantaneous tribes were fierce.""(National Food Strategy, 2021)","text",58
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Separately, the authors also conducted a public survey on support for a meat tax. The survey asked respondents about their support for two types of meat taxes - one for fresh meat, and one for processed meat. For fresh meat, 26% of respondents supported the tax (strongly or somewhat), 48% of respondents opposed the tax (strongly or somewhat), and 26% reported being unsure or neither. For processed meat, 48% of respondents supported the tax (strongly or somewhat), 24% of respondents opposed the tax (strongly or somewhat), and 28% reported being unsure or neither. These results appear to support the conclusions of the authors of the National Food Strategy, though support for a tax on processed meat was notably higher. One analyst, who worked on the National Food Strategy at the time, informed us via e-mail that both polls had a sample size of around 1,200 and conformed to the Market Research Society Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct requires data collection to be fit for purpose and appropriate to the audience, implying  that proper consideration was given to representativeness.","text",59
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Another highly relevant source is a public opinion survey run in the UK by YouGov(2021). This survey had 2,169 respondents and included a question asking about support for a meat tax, with the results weighted to ensure that they were representative. In this survey, 20% of respondents supported a meat tax, 55% were opposed, and 25% were unsure or neutral. Interestingly, support for a meat tax  in this survey appeared to be higher among Labour voters and among young people. We believe that this survey was sufficiently rigorous given the large sample size, the expertise of the company that conducted the survey, and the weighting of results to ensure representativeness.","text",60
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","We found one more public opinion survey that we believe deserves particular consideration. This survey was conducted in Norway in 2017, with 1,222 respondents who were approximately representative of the Norwegian population(Grimsrudet al., 2020). In this survey, 27% of respondents supported a meat tax, 57% were opposed, and 16% were unsure. We are confident in the rigour of this survey given the approximately representative sample, the large sample size, and the lack of any apparent conflicts of interest by the authors.","text",61
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","We are also aware of three further public opinion surveys, although we believe that the strength of the evidence from these surveys is lower. First, the True Animal Protein Price (TAPP) Coalition(2020)commissioned a survey of respondents in France (531 respondents), Germany (514), and the Netherlands (513). In those surveys, approximately 64-75% of respondents expressed support for a meat tax that was designed to improve animal welfare. In another question in those surveys, framed differently, approximately 50% of respondents expressed support. However, some scepticism about these findings may be warranted as the TAPP Coalition may have an interest in promoting the meat tax in public policy debates. In addition,  while it is reported that there was an ""appropriate distribution across gender, age, income and political background"", it is unclear whether these distributions were representative of the national populations. Second, Yavuz(2020)reports a smaller survey in each of Sweden and Turkey. Since these surveys used non-random sampling methods and small sample sizes, it is difficult to draw generalizable conclusions. Finally, FAIRR(2017)reports a survey from Sweden where 25% of respondents supported a meat tax. However, this survey is being reported second-hand, and we cannot find the original source or any methodological details of the survey.","text",62
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","To summarise these quantitative measures, it appears that only a minority of the UK public are likely to support the establishment of a meat tax. There is notable agreement between the three surveys we consider particularly relevant and reliable, with 20%, 26%, or 27% of respondents in favour(Grimsrudet al., 2020; National Food Strategy, 2021; YouGov, 2021). Support may depend on demographics(YouGov, 2021)and be higher for a tax on processed meat only(National Food Strategy, 2021). Of course, these measures should not be regarded as constant since public opinion often changes as a policy or political debate develops(Adams-Cohen, 2020; e.g., Nordø, 2021).","text",63
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","With these findings in mind, further nuance can be added by considering several pieces of qualitative research. Focus groups conducted by Wellesley et al.(2015)revealed that participants expect the backlash from a meat tax to be short-lived, particularly if the policy and its justification were explained well. However, many people have expressed concern about the effects of a meat tax on lower-income people. Notably, this concern was also expressed by participants in the National Food Strategy(2021)report. Research has indeed identified that people's social class, education, and material resources influence their ability to change their food consumption patterns(Einhorn, 2021). In fact, some modelling studies have investigated this phenomenon explicitly in relation to a meat tax. Chalmers et al.(2016)predicted that different socioeconomic groups would respond to a meat tax differently while Kehlbacher et al.(2016)found that an emissions-focussed food tax would disproportionately penalise lower socioeconomic groups. Beyond this, the complex values surrounding the meat tax debate in the UK are analysed by Simmonds and Vallgarda(2021). This qualitative study examines public discourse in great detail, and interested readers would benefit from reading the study in full. For our purposes, the key conclusion is that there are two levels to the meat tax debate in the UK. The first centres on the question ""Is meat consumption a problem in the UK?"", and the second on ""Is a meat tax the best way to reduce meat consumption?"". Both questions are contested. A notable nuance, specific to the UK context, is that the UK's meat production is perceived by many to be ""uniquely sustainable"". This perception leads some to the conclusion that the UK has a responsibility to produce meat for export.","text",64

We believe that delving into this literature in greater detail would be a fruitful endeavour for organisations interested in this question.","text",66
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","One major driver of public support is how the tax revenue would be used. In the bookMeatonomics, Simon(2013)hypothesises that using the tax to provide a lump sum payment to every member of the public would substantially increase public support for the meat tax. In support of this hypothesis, studies have shown that public support for a meat tax may be increased if the revenue from the tax is used to pay for further public or environmental benefits(Wellesley, Happer and Froggatt, 2015; Grimsrudet al., 2020; TAPP Coalition, 2020; Muhammad, Mohd Hasnu and Ekins, 2021). A second major driver of public support is communication. Public support for environmental taxes is generally higher when the public is well-informed about the tax, the details of the tax, and the effectiveness of the tax(Muhammad, Mohd Hasnu and Ekins, 2021). Likewise, public support is generally higher when the policy is perceived to distribute costs and benefits fairly among members of society(Muhammad, Mohd Hasnu and Ekins, 2021). Finally, the public may offer greater support if a tax is described or framed in particular ways(Grimsrudet al., 2020).","text",67

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","It may be possible to enact a meat tax despite the likely low levels of public support. As Harris(2021)concludes, legislation can pass without public support, and the attitude of policymakers may be more relevant than public support in determining legislative success. As such, it is important to consider support among Members of Parliament (MPs).","text",69
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Recently, senior officials in the UK government, currently led by the Conservative Party, have publicly stated that they are opposed to a meat tax. One official was quoted by newspaperThe Sun: ""This is categorically not going to happen.""(National Food Strategy, 2021). This official was speaking in the context of media attention sparked by a leaked memo, in which the Prime Minister asked government departments to report the prices that would correspond to carbon emissions in those departments' jurisdictions(Clark, 2021). Given this public commitment, it appears unlikely that the Conservative Party's UK government would support a meat tax, although government officials do sometimes fail to fulfil pledges(Thomsonet al., 2017).","text",70
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Given that there appears to be a partisan divide in attitudes towards meat consumption, with support for a meat tax higher among Labour voters(YouGov, 2021), it is also worth considering the views of MPs from other parties. A comment by one Labour MP did not rule out the possibility of a meat tax(Kendal, 2019)while the party's environment manifesto does appear to support a reduced consumption of red and processed meat(Labour Party, 2019a). However, the party's environment manifesto and animal welfare manifesto both contain references to working with farmers and fishers(Labour Party, 2019a, 2019b).

While the party seeks to reduce emissions, it appears to favour methods that also support farmers(Scottish National Party, 2021). Conversely, a policy paper by the Liberal Democrats on climate does state that ""consumption of meat and dairy products will have to fall""(Liberal Democrats, 2019). There may also be support for a meat tax among smaller parties, such as the Green Party(Harvey and van der Zee, 2019), although such parties currently hold very few seats in the UK Parliament.","text",72

However, the analysis showed that a carefully designed meat tax is legal and consistent with the many regulations facing a state. These include the environmental legal framework of the EU, international climate change regulations, international trade law, and human rights law. A study by Arvidsson(2016), also focussing on the EU context, largely agreed with these conclusions. That study also identified several legislative mechanisms by which a meat tax could be implemented in the EU, including an excise duty, emissions taxation, or a reform of the Value Added Tax system. The latter mechanism could, specifically, involve raising the Value Added Tax on a particular set of products.","text",77

Moreover, the analysis also shows that lobbying efforts that have directly conflicting perspectives were ""most likely to achieve none of their lobbying goals"". Meanwhile, the analysis demonstrates that higher public salience of an issue is associated with a lower probability of success. Separately, Soule and Olzak(2004)showed that an issue has a particularly low probability of succeeding if public support is low.","text",79
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Given this evidence, the outlook for a successful meat tax campaign appears to be pessimistic. Since a meat tax affects all agricultural producers and almost all consumers, it would be classified as multi-sector or system wide. Public opinion surveys and ""deliberative dialogues"" suggest low public support and fierce opposition, while the media interest sparked by a single leaked government memo(e.g., Clark, 2021)suggests that any discussion on a meat tax would experience high salience in the media. Therefore, we would expect the probability of success of a meat tax campaign to be well below the 20% figure cited above. In our detailed analysis, we have decided to use 5% as the probability of success. Regardless of the accuracy of this specific 5% figure, the tractability of a meat tax campaign appears to be very low.","text",80

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","To complement our review of the evidence, we interviewed one of the authors from Revoredo-Giha et al (2018), Wirsenius et al (2011) and Briggs et al (2016). This was particularly beneficial since we view these as the most important papers for our analysis. The general view from these authors was that a carbon-weighted foods tax would have a consistently good effect on environmental outcomes but that the exact changes in the consumption of different products would be difficult to predict. This was both due to the limitations of the data we have available for modelling, leading to the extrapolation of findings far outside their original context, and because of the complexity of the interactions between different products. This is a particular problem outside of the United Kingdom where most research up to now has taken place. In a global context, the elasticity of goods may only be tracked as a commodity rather than a product, making it even more difficult to project real-world outcomes from these models.","text",82

The effects of any tax policy will be difficult to project in advance and will likely lead to unforeseen consequences in the food system. The most likely of these is an increase in chicken and pork consumption which experts commented that there is a significant chance there will be an increase. An exception to this was a flat tax on all meat or animal products where the relative price of these products did not change. If this came into effect, the models we reviewed predict that overall consumption of these products would decrease as consumers shift to more vegetables and grains. The proportion of each type of food within consumers' overall purchases would likely stay the same, thus avoiding the SARP.

We use four scenarios from within that paper: a tax on beef and veal only (which we label Study 6A), a tax on all meat (Study 6B), a tax on all animal products (Study 6C), and a tax on all food (Study 6D). For all four of those cases, we use the compensated scenario from within that paper.","text",93
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","The decision to use these plausible, off-the-shelf scenarios avoids the need to estimate the taxes and model the subsequent changes in consumption ourselves. Our literature review identified many studies that modelled the effects of a meat tax on consumption (see Appendix). From those studies, we selected the six studies above for two reasons. Firstly, these studies each include a wide range of meat and animal products, which is important for understanding the overall effect of a tax across many animal species. Secondly, these studies are relevant to the context of the UK or the EU. Where the studies modelled both uncompensated (i.e., a revenue-positive tax) and compensated (i.e., a revenue-neutral tax) scenarios, we used the compensated scenario. These scenarios tended to give similar changes in consumption, and we feel that a compensated, revenue-neutral tax is more politically plausible.","text",94
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Each of the selected studies conducts an economic model of the effects of a tax on consumption changes across many different types of meat and animal products. In all of the selected studies, the taxes for each product were determined according to the greenhouse gas emissions of that product. We believe that this is an appropriate choice, as the conversation on the meat tax has been dominated by environmental concerns⁷(see ‘Tractability’ above). Notably, there is also public discussion on a meat tax for health reasons⁸. However, fewer studies appear to model the effects of a meat tax for health, and the ones that do are both less specific to the UK context and consider far fewer products (see Appendix). One exception to this is Briggs et al.(2016)which considers how the emissions-focused tax subsequently affects health.","text",95
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","In our analysis, we considered pigs, finfish (both wild-caught and farmed), poultry animals (including chickens and turkeys), and ruminant animals (including cows and sheep). We considered cows bred for meat and for dairy, and chickens for meat and for eggs. We calculated the effects of a meat tax on the suffering of these animals as follows. Firstly, we calculated how many animals of each group are consumed in the UK each year. We then obtained the percentage changes in consumption of each of these animals, as predicted by each scenario outlined above. From here, we calculated how many animals of each group wouldno longerbe consumed under each scenario. We also incorporated information on the average lifespans of each group of animals. This allowed us to report the number of animals, adjusted for lifespan, saved each year by a meat tax.","text",96

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","The most salient finding from our detailed analysis is that the predicted outcome of a meat tax can vary significantly. Some of the modelling studies predict that a meat tax would result in overall benefits to farmed animals, and some predict that a meat tax would result in overall harm to farmed animals. Moreover, there is no obvious pattern that governs which studies predict which outcome.","text",105
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Our interpretation is that meat tax models act as something like a chaotic system. That is, a particular model involves many choices - which country or community, which products to tax, which data sources, which elasticities, which tax rates, and so on - that cumulatively determine the outcome. Importantly, these choices interact in complex ways, making it impossible to predict the outcome of any meat tax model just by looking at the choices made.","text",106
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Therefore, it is implausible to say in advance whether a meat tax model predicts overall benefits or overall harm to farmed animals. By extension, it is implausible to say whether a meat taxin realitywould bring overall benefits or overall harm to farmed animals. This indicates that the animal advocacy movement should probably stay away from campaigning for a meat tax since it is too difficult to know whether such a campaign would be good or bad for animals. Considering there are many campaigns that have robust evidence in favour of them, dedicating a campaign to a meat tax seems ill-advised.","text",107
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","Evidence against this chaotic view comes from Jansson and Säll (2018), who point out that they observed cross-country differences in consumption changes due to different levels of production, consumption, and elasticity. This might increase the credibility of a claim that the country in which a meat tax is implemented matters significantly. Nevertheless, in our detailed analysis, even the studies that focused purely on the UK (Studies 1-3, 6) showed substantial variation in results. Therefore, while the location of the study may have some effect on the outcome, it is still too difficult to predict the outcome of the study purely on the basis of country.","text",108
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","There are some possible exceptions to this chaotic view. For example, a meat tax levied on animal suffering would be tailor-made to prevent the SARP (see ‘The type of meat tax might matter’ above). This type of meat tax would almost certainly bring overall benefits for farmed animals. However, we feel strongly that this type of meat tax would be unrealistic to implement. Given that there is very low public support for a meat tax levied for environmental or health reasons, it seems near impossible to gain support for a meat tax levied for a justification (preventing animal suffering) with even lower public support.","text",109

It seems reasonable to assume that there is a positive relationship between egg production and the number of male chicks killed, although we haven't tested this assumption. Six studies (Studies 1-4, 6C, 6D) predict a decrease in egg consumption, so it is reasonable to expect that those six studies would result in fewer male chicks being bred and killed.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","There is a risk that a poorly designed meat tax could cause demand to shift from domestically produced meat to imported meat. If the tax is levied on production, rather than consumption, then the price of domestically produced meat would increase, but the price of imported meat would not(Wirsenius, Hedenus and Mohlin, 2011; García-Muroset al., 2017). This would incentivise consumers to substitute domestically produced meat for imported meat. The result of such a policy may be that animal suffering is not necessarily reduced, but merely displaced to a different country¹⁰. Animal suffering may even increase overall, as farmed animal welfare in the UK appears to be better than average(World Animal Protection, 2020). To avoid merely shifting animal suffering to a different country, a meat tax would ideally be levied on consumption rather than production(Wirsenius, Hedenus and Mohlin, 2011; García-Muroset al., 2017). Levying the tax on consumption would increase the price of both domestically produced and imported meats, thus eliminating the incentive for consumers to substitute towards imported meat.","text",125

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","It is possible that a meat tax would raise revenue for the government. This revenue can be used to deliver further benefits. For example, the government could use the revenue to reduce other taxes, such as income tax or value-added tax(Grimsrudet al., 2020; Muhammad, Mohd Hasnu and Ekins, 2021). This may deliver economic benefits and improve human wellbeing, although that hypothesis depends on context and is debated in the literature(Freire-González, 2018). An example of this is found in several of the modelling studies we reviewed that explicitly consider scenarios where the tax revenue is used to subsidise low-emission foods(Briggset al., 2013, 2016; Edjabou and Smed, 2013). Similarly, the government could use the revenue to deliver public benefits such as lump-sum payments(Simon, 2013)or reduced university  tuition fees(Muhammad, Mohd Hasnu and Ekins, 2021), each of which may have positive social effects. Alternatively, the government could deliver environmental benefits, such as habitat protection or the further development of renewable energy(Grimsrudet al., 2020; Muhammad, Mohd Hasnu and Ekins, 2021). These measures would likely improve environmental sustainability and human wellbeing. However, environmental benefits may cause greater suffering to animals, depending on the context and given some strong assumptions(e.g., Tomasik, 2017; Brian Tomasik, 2018).","text",127

Simon(2013)argues that a meat tax would lead to large-scale system change, thus contributing towards the eventual abolition of commercial animal exploitation. However, it is also plausible that a meat tax would lead people to believe that it is acceptable to exploit animals, as long as the cost of doing so is high enough. This could make people feel less complicit in animal exploitation, potentially contributing to the ""psychological refuge effect""(Anthis, 2017).

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price","In conclusion, we do not recommend a meat tax as a campaign for animal advocacy organisations. While a meat tax could reduce the number of animals killed for food, the tax also carries a substantial risk ofincreasingthis number and thus causing overall harm. The probability of this risk is very difficult to calculate. However, as shown in our detailed analysis, many modelling studies do indeed predict an overall increase in the number of animals killed for food. In particular, many environmental- and health-motivated policies would place higher taxes on beef than chicken or fish, exacerbating this risk. Furthermore, public support for a meat tax is very low meaning any campaign would have a low probability of success. For this reason, we do not recommend campaigning for a meat tax. We instead encourage animal advocacy organisations to select an ask that has a more robust and favourable base of evidence.","text",131

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","The next few decades represent a looming catastrophe for farmed animals. The production of meat and animal products is projected to expand substantially.This growth is expected to be highest for animals who typically experience the poorest welfare conditions on farms (such as chickens, fish, and crustaceans). Furthermore, farming is likely to become more intensive. All of these factors mean that significantly more animals will experience severe suffering for the sake of the production of meat and animal products.","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","A key driver of this growth is the expansion of intensive animal agriculture in low and lower-middle income countries.As a country's agriculture industry expands, the number of animals farmed in intensive conditions in that country depends on two key factors: per-capita meat consumption (consumption) and the level of industrialisation in meat production systems (production). Both of these key factors follow average trends relating to demographics. Generally, as countries become wealthier, per-capita meat consumption tends to increase, and the meat production system becomes more industrialised.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","Critically, there is variation in trends of meat consumption and meat production across different developing countries.Some countries have much lower per-capita meat consumption than other countries with similar levels of wealth, and some countries have become wealthier without a significant increase in per-capita meat consumption. On the production side, some countries exhibit much lower levels of intensification compared to other countries with similar levels of wealth. This suggests that countries can achieve economic growth while minimising harms to animals.","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","Why does this variation exist? When countries have low per-capita consumption, rates of per-capita consumption that are not increasing, or low levels of intensification, is this because the country has pursued certain policies? If so, what are these policies - and can they be replicated in other countries?Identifying these policies could unlock strategies to prevent large numbers of animals being farmed in abhorrent conditions while developing countries experience economic growth. Alternatively, it is possible that these trends are influenced by factors other than policies, which may not be replicable in other countries.","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","This report is aimed at animal advocacyresearchers. In particular, this report is intended for researchers who are interested in exploring whether there are particular policies that can influence meat consumption and production as countries develop.We do not make any specific policy recommendations in this report, as the research is still at an early stage. However, we believe that building on this research will indeed uncover impactful policy recommendations in the future.","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","In this report, we seek to provide a foundation on which other researchers can build and identify promising directions for further research.We have obtained datasets that can be used to identify these outlying countries. For the consumption side, initial exploration of individual countries has taken place, and potential research directions that the movement could pursue are identified. Regarding the production side, data availability has limited our analysis, so we have identified opportunities for the movement to improve the available data.","text",17
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","If you are a researcher interested in slowing the growth of industrial animal agriculture in developing countries, we think the most promising research directions are as follows:","text",18
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","For consumption, we identified two countries with steady or declining meat and fish consumption: Slovakia and Thailand. It is possible that these steady/declining trends are due to policies that can be replicated in other countries. So, it could be worthwhile for the movement to investigate these two countries in greater depth.","text",19
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","For consumption, we identified nine countries with lowbaselineconsumption (rather than a steady/decliningtrendin consumption): Botswana, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Eswatini, and India. It could also be worthwhile to investigate the reasons for this low consumption.","text",20
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","For production, we have identified a dataset(1)that could be useful for figuring out why some countries adopt intensive animal production systems while others do not. But the dataset is incomplete. Spending some time developing this dataset would enable the movement to start investigating which countries have lower-than-expected levels of intensification, and whether this is due to any particular policies that could be replicated in other countries.","text",21
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","For both consumption and production, comparing different regionswithina country could also be a promising research direction. This could also identify policies that explain differences in meat consumption or industrialisation between regions. Due to time constraints, we have only focused on comparing differencesacrosscountries.","text",22

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","Unless policies change, the next few decades represent a catastrophe for farmed animals. Consumption of meat and animal products is projected to increase substantially over the coming decades, with one study projecting a global increase of 38% between 2020 and 2050(2). For the consumption of animal products to grow by this magnitude over the next three decades, many more animals will suffer and die to meet this demand  - in fact, since the growth will be dominated by small-bodied animals like fish, crustaceans, and chickens, the number ofindividualanimals farmed is likely to increase by much more than 38%(3). These are also the groups of animals who, generally speaking, experience the worst welfare conditions out of all farmed animals and require the most suffering per unit of food(8–11). Moreover, the catastrophe could be compounded by the growing insect farming industry, which will likely involve farming trillions of insects - who, the evidence strongly suggests, have the capacity to feel pain(12)- to provide feed for the farming of poultry, fish, pigs, and other animals(13).","text",48
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","The growth will be highest in low and lower-middle income countries(2,3). For example, the share of global meat consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa will probably at least double by 2100, and a quadrupling of its global share seems possible(4). This growth will likely be supported by the intensification of agriculture - more animals will be produced, and they will be farmed under more intensive conditions. By intensive animal farming, we mean the system of commercial animal farming that involves large-scale, indoor facilities, where animals are 'confined indoors under strictly-controlled conditions'(5). The definition is slightly different for fish and crustaceans, for whom intensive farming refers to systems with high stocking densities and high levels of input and management (e.g. feed); these systems are associated with numerous welfare problems(6,7). There are signs that intensive animal agriculture is politically well-supported and becoming more common in Sub-Saharan Africa(4).","text",49
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","Campaigns to appose industrialisation have been gaining initial attention and consideration in the animal advocacy movement(4,14,15). For example, mitigating the growth of industrialised farming in Africa was a key resolution from the 6th Africa Animal Welfare Conference in Gaborone, Botswana in 2022. Still, It is unknown whether it is possible for advocates in developing countries to limit the intensification of animal agriculture(4,15); expert opinions are divided(15).","text",50
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","Likewise, if there are ways to limit the consumption of meat and animal products, then this could cause fewer animals to be farmed for food. Since the scale of animal production in developing countries is projected to grow substantially, succeeding in either of these areas could affect a disproportionately large number of animals. As such, influencing the trajectory of animal farming in developing countries is a major opportunity for improving the lives of animals. This is a critical knowledge gap for the animal advocacy movement. The goal of this report is to help advance the research into this question.","text",51

The authors conclude that many smallholders could remain economically viable for a long time, and the authors suggest ways to promote small-scale farming.","text",54
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","Schneider(18)describes the concept of the 'meat grab', which involves land deals undertaken to allow industrial meat production. These land deals can be direct (e.g. animal housing and stocking) or indirect (e.g. feed crop production). Schneider argues that the spread of industrial livestock production is driven by 'agribusiness-led and state-brokered industrial meat regimes' that involve land grabbing, hiding externalised costs, and promoting narratives that link meat consumption with progress.","text",55

As far as we know, there has not yet been a major, global-scale analysis on this question. Do all countries necessarily develop an intensified animal farming sector, or is it possible for animal farming to remain extensive and small-scale? Are there policies that can meaningfully limit the number of animals living in intensive agriculture as a country develops? If so, what are these policies? In this report, we hope to begin this line of thinking and begin some research directions for the animal advocacy movement to pursue.","text",60

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","(Consumption) The demand for meat in that country, which can be expressed as the meat consumed per person. If the people in a country eat more meat, then there will be higher demand for meat, which would translate to more animals being farmed and killed. This factor can be measured using the metricmeat consumption per capita, which is the average amount of meat consumed per person in a country.","text",64
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","(Production) The level of intensification in animal agriculture in that country. If the farms in a country are more intensive, then a higher proportion of animals will live and die under intensive conditions. This factor can be measured using the metricproportion of intensive animal production, which is the fraction of animal farming operations in a country that use intensive (rather than extensive) production systems.","text",65
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","As a country develops, those two major factors also evolve in a predictable way. It is well-established that, on average, as a country becomes wealthier, meat demand per person increases. Likewise, on average, as a country becomes wealthier, animal agriculture transitions from mostly extensive to mostly intensive. We review the evidence supporting these two trends below.","text",66
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","Critically, these trends hold on average, but not necessarily for every country individually.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","It may be the case that, on average, people in wealthier countries consume more meat, but are there individual countries that have become more wealthy while keeping per-person meat consumption steady? Wealthier countries tend to transition towards intensive agriculture, but are there individual countries that have not done so? And if there are individual countries that do not follow these trends - in other words, if some countries have lower meat consumption or a lower proportion of intensive agriculture than would be expected - is the reason that these countries have pursued policies that could be replicated in other countries? These questions are our focus in this report.","text",68
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","Note that, for our analysis of consumption, we focus on meat and fish and we refer to the total weight of animal products consumed. Ideally, an analysis would include all animal products (especially eggs) and convert the weights of meat, fish, and animal products into 'number of animals slaughtered per capita' or 'number of animals alive at any one time'. This would require some tricky calculations and assumptions - it would be a fruitful endeavour for the next study on this topic, but our current study is just a first look. Sans and Combris(22)(discussed below) found that meat is the most important of the four, though it's still possible for fish, eggs, or milk to increase over time even where meat doesn't.","text",69

One key factor is urbanisation: people in cities tend to eat away from home and prefer pre-cooked convenience foods.

The authors also analysed fish, dairy, and egg consumption. The authors find that the consumption of meat and these other animal-based proteins is positively correlated with both GDP per capita and urbanisation. Most of the increase in animal-based protein consumption over time is explained by growth in meat consumption, rather than the consumption of fish, dairy, or eggs.","text",81

The authors identified two types of countries: countries in which GDP per capita is correlated with meat consumption, and countries in which there is no such correlation. There were nine countries (all highly wealthy) where GDP per capita was unrelated to meat consumption: Switzerland, Norway, the USA, Australia, Canada, Israel, the UK, New Zealand, and Saudi Arabia. In fact, for some of these countries (New Zealand, Canada, Switzerland), meat consumption appears to be decreasing. The authors believe that this is because many people in these wealthy countries are consciously reducing their meat consumption, motivated by concerns for the environment, health, and animal welfare, as well as higher availability of alternative proteins. This finding is less relevant for our report - while decreasing meat consumption in wealthy countries is a good thing, here we are most interested in the short- and medium-term future of animal farming in developing countries.","text",83

In light of this data, that Djibouti, Iraq, Algeria, and Iran average 45% seems fairly typical for arid countries. While this data isn’t conclusive, it suggests a correlation between aridity and high meat prices, which plausibly explains low levels of meat consumption in arid countries. This hypothesis could be more conclusively tested via a regression examining the relationship between annual rainfall and meat consumption or prices across all countries (while controlling for GDP per capita).

This suggests the causes of low meat consumption in these countries do operate (at least partly) via raising meat prices. As none of these countries are especially arid, it’s unclear what these causes might be at this stage. Based on the Numbeo data, meat seems disproportionately expensive in the poorest European countries, which may help to explain the prices in the three European countries, though it’s still unclear what the mechanism might be. (The mechanism may also help explain Slovakia’s decline in meat consumption, which we discuss later in this report.)","text",138
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","This leaves India. India’s low level of meat consumption is mostly explained by high rates of vegetarianism among Hindus, but there are a number of caveats to this. Firstly, even if this is true, keeping rates of vegetarianism high within India could still be a major priority for animal advocates, given the large population and rising wealth of the country. Secondly, rates of vegetarianism across the country and across different social groups vary significantly(25), so Indian states with low rates of vegetarianism might still contain lessons about meat consumption that apply to other countries. Finally, if the link between Hindu belief and vegetarianism has grown stronger over time, Indian culture and policy may still contain lessons for public outreach in other countries. (Of course, care must be taken given the relationship between vegetarianism, nationalism, and caste in India.)","text",139

We were unable to find more detail on the precise nature of these subsidies, beyond an expert telling us that these subsidies included a negative sales tax on beef (28). However, if the removal of consumption subsidies in the early 1990s really is the key factor explaining the long term decline, this is potentially encouraging for the animal advocacy movement.

The obvious downside to these points is the fact that they seem to have the strongest effect on the consumption of beef, and possibly pork, which are likely less harmful from an animal welfare production than the consumption of chicken(9–11). In developed countries, where chicken acts as a substitute for beef and pork, this may mean that this policy can cause more harm to animals than good(9–11).

We haven’t found any resources either confirming or disconfirming the possibility that this underreporting applies to the FAO consumption data for Thailand as well (and we are exploring this point with experts).

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","We do not think that this plateau can be explained by exports. Thailand is a major exporter of chicken, and even more so of fish, so we considered exports raising prices and displacing domestic consumption as a hypothesis. However, unlike in Paraguay and Uruguay, Thailand primarily exports non-luxury meats - therefore, rising prices would not necessarily displace domestic consumption. Additionally, Piumsombun(29)notes: “Despite the fact that Thailand is a net fish exporting country, domestic per capita fish consumption is relatively high compared to consumption of other three main animal protein commodities, namely pork, beef, and chicken”. Piumsombun’s data also shows that per capita fish consumption rose by 3% per annum between 1980 and 2000.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","Paraguay and Uruguay are a more interesting case. Nin et al.(30)examine domestic beef production in Paraguay and Uruguay from the 1970s and find that both countries underwent a significant increase in their beef production and beef exports during the period, especially between ~1990 and the mid 2000s, yet their beef consumption steadily declined during the period. Specifically, Paraguayan beef consumption peaked at 44 kg/capita in 1992, and bottomed out at 11 kg/capita in 2009, and Uruguayan beef consumption peaked in 1994 at 63 kg/capita, and bottomed out in 2007 at 19 kg/capita (FAOSTAT Food Balances data). Both countries' beef consumption remained relatively flat through the 2010s as well (FAOSTAT Food Balances data). Whitton et al.(24)explicitly connect this decline to an increasingly lucrative export market displacing domestic consumption in the case of Paraguay. Nin et al.(30)attribute Uruguay’s increase in beef exports/production and simultaneous decline in domestic consumption to a number of liberalising economic policy changes during the 1990s. The most important changes included the lifting of export taxes and various domestic beef subsidies and price controls (similar to the case of Slovakia).","text",176
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","Nin et al. (32) discuss three likely aspects of the causal chain: increasing exports causes increasing domestic beef prices, which causes lower domestic meat consumption. Firstly, as beef exports to wealthier markets increased, this drove up the price of scarce inputs like land (and possibly calves), leading to a higher floor on domestic prices. Secondly, in order to secure access to more demanding export markets, both countries introduced strict quality and health controls during the 1990s and 2000s. This increased domestic production costs, which was plausibly passed on to consumers. Finally, soybean production and exports also increased significantly in both countries during this period, which may have increased land prices, and hence the cost of beef production, by restricting the supply of cheap pasture.","text",177
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","This explanation of beef exports displacing domestic meat consumption seems broadly plausible, especially considering the unusually central role of beef as a staple food in both countries. Aside from the removal of domestic price controls in Uruguay (a policy change also present in Slovakia), it seems like declining meat consumption in Uruguay and Paraguay doesn’t suggest any policy proposals for reducing meat consumption in developing countries as a whole. Rather, this seems to be a case of reducing consumption in one country while increasing it elsewhere. It is worth noting that good long-run data showing an increase in the domestic price of meat, especially beef, in both countries during this period would provide stronger evidence for our hypothesis that exports displaced domestic consumption. Unfortunately we’ve so far been unable to find such data for the relevant period.","text",178

Hartwich et al(31)and Wang et al(32)both present a picture of widespread production inefficiency hampering levels of meat consumption. Hartwich et al focus on red meat production, where they note that low levels of red meat consumption may be caused by poor vertical integration, a lack of access to credit, opaque markets, and a general lack of demand for (or regulation of) meat quality. Wang et al note general inefficiencies associated with small-scale, mostly household-level production of animal products in rural areas as another factor.","text",181

So, further research examining trends in different regions within Tanzania, or comparing Tanzania with similar countries could be productive. However, even if some of these features of the Tanzanian market were identified as being responsible for the declining meat + fish consumption, it’s difficult to see how they could be turned into worthwhile policy recommendations. If the animal advocacy movement seeks to prevent the intensification of animal agriculture in developing countries, while fully supporting human economic development, it doesn’t look like recreating the conditions of Tanzania’s meat market is a viable path forward.","text",182

Broiler chickens farmed under intensive conditions generally have a higher productivity than those farmed under extensive conditions(36). However, the opposite trend has been observed for other animals like cows(37). Also, the breed of chickens used (fast-growing vs slow-growing) is a much stronger predictor of productivity than the production system(36). So, productivity is likely to be a poor proxy for a country's level of intensification.","text",205

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","In this report, we have focused on analysing differences in consumption and production of meat productsbetweendifferent countries. However, it could be equally useful to look at different regionswithin a single country. If a country consists of different regions, or states, or territories, then it is possible that those different areas have different patterns of meat consumption or industrialisation of meat production. Perhaps one state within a country has become wealthier but has maintained a steady per-capita meat consumption, or maybe a particular region has been slower to industrialise its animal agriculture industry than other regions. If future research can identify such regions, then that might also be a promising place to search for policies that can slow the growth of industrial animal agriculture.","text",208

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","We believe that influencing the trajectory of animal farming in developing countries should be a major priority for the animal advocacy movement, despite the small possibility that factory farming may be made obsolete by alternative proteins (e.g. currently available plant-based products, or future products made from cultivated meat). It is unclear how alternative proteins will develop in the future. We do not know whether alternative proteins will grow into a meaningful and permanent competitor for meat and animal products(38–40), and we do not know how the performance of alternative proteins will differ across countries. This means that relying on alternative proteins to prevent the colossal amount of animal suffering in the world's future is very risky. Separately, restricting factory farming may help alternative proteins take hold - some animal welfare improvements can make meat and animal products less economically competitive, and some improvements can even reduce the number of animals farmed in a country(41). As such, even if you are optimistic about alternative proteins, policies that restrict the growth of factory farming in developing countries are nevertheless an important tool for the animal advocacy movement.","text",210

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","Finally, we would like to emphasise that animal advocacy in developing countries is different from animal advocacy in developed countries in many ways. For example, many people and governments see the growth of animal agriculture as one pathway to economic growth and development. The issue of requiring animal welfare standards or limiting industrial growth for those living in poverty is the subject of debate(42). At the same time, issues facing humans such as poverty, disease, and food insecurity which makes it difficult for many people to see animal welfare as a priority(15). Furthermore, animal advocacy has a history of being used to oppress people who undertake practices that do not conform to dominant Western ideals(43–45). When people in developed countries advocate against particular practices overseas, this can reinforce harmful racial prejudices(46,47). That said, animal welfare is not a concept unique to Western countries - in one study across a wide variety of countries, participants in all countries agreed that the welfare of both farmed and companion animals were important, and participants supported laws protecting animal welfare(48). The authors of this present report are based in wealthy, developed countries, and we acknowledge the bias and blindspots that this position brings. Our primary aim is to provide tools, including this report, to assist the work of animal advocates living and working in developing countries - indeed, one such collaboration with an organisation based in Uganda provided the initial motivation to write this report. We are aware of many animal advocacy organisations in developing countries that are enthusiastic about limiting the growth of intensified animal farming in their own countries, and it is this work that we aim to support.","text",212

"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","Based on the data and analysis in this report, there are some fruitful topics of research that would benefit the animal advocacy movement if explored further:","text",214
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","Consumption: We identified two especially promising countries with steady or declining meat + fish consumption: Slovakia and Thailand. It is possible that these steady/declining trends are due to policies that can be replicated in other countries. The same applies for Uruguay’s removal of domestic beef subsidies in the 1990s. So, it could be worthwhile for the movement to investigate these three countries in greater depth. Additionally, the twelve countries with a steady/declining trend in meat consumption which we didn’t investigate in depth represent promising avenues for future research. Also, we identified nine countries with lowbaselineconsumption (rather than a steady/decliningtrendin consumption): Botswana, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Eswatini, and India. It could also be worthwhile to investigate the reasons for this low baseline consumption.","text",215
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","Production: It would be useful to improve upon the data in Figure 8 by figuring out which countries correspond to which data points. This would identify countries with levels of intensification in animal farming that are lower than would be expected based on those countries' wealth. Exploring why those countries have low levels of intensification may identify policies that could be replicated in other developing countries. This could be achieved by obtaining the raw data from Gilbert et al (althoughtheir model projections are available, our attempts to contact the authors for raw data have been unsuccessful), some careful detective work on the dataset, or by replicating the data collection that was conducted by Gilbert et al to create a new dataset.","text",216
"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend","For both consumption and production, it could also be promising to compare different regionswithina single country. This could also help identify policies that explain differences in meat consumption or the level of industrialisation between regions.","text",217

"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","Public consultations are increasingly common in Western democracies, could animal advocates leverage from them to influence policy?","text",10
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","Authors: Max Carpendale","text",11
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","DESCRIPTION OF THE ASK","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","Governments often conduct public consultations in which stakeholders can submit their view on a proposed policy. This is especially common in Western democracies such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and the European Union. Perhaps because of pressure for governments to be perceived as more participatory, their use has become more prevalent over time(Kerley and Starr 2000). Additionally, they are often practised by sub jurisdictions within countries, such as states, provinces or cities.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","The exact terminology used to refer to this process varies by region, but we will refer to this as “consultations” for public consultations for those that are publicly accessible.","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","Many public consultations present an opportunity for the animal advocacy movement to influence policy, thereby benefiting the lives of animals. However, due to resource constraints, many impactful public consultations are missed by the movement.","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","This approach could involve establishing an organisation of just two or three people to a) build a database of jurisdictions around the world that regularly use public consultations, b) monitor upcoming consultations that could affect the lives of animals, c) write and make submissions to those consultations, and d) coordinate with animal advocates in particular jurisdictions to make similar submissions. This organisation could both prepare submissions itself and assist local organisations who may be unaware of the consultation or may not have the capacity to organise an independent response.","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","This is a form of government lobbying, but it is a unique one - the policy windows are open for a short but highly predictable time, it is very cheap and easy to make a submission, and governments are often required by law to consider the views expressed in submissions when developing the final policy. As such, our research on this approach builds on our previous report on the impact of lobbying - there we concluded that lobbying does influence policy at least some of the time(Springlea 2022).","text",17
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","Many obvious submissions do get attention from animal advocacy organisations. For example, large organisations like the RSPCA often coordinate responses to consultations involving farmed animal regulations, companion animal cruelty laws, wildlife management, and so on.","text",18
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","However, it is easy to miss opportunities in adjacent policy fields, even when the potential impacts on animals could be large. For example, there is often a profound effect on animals from biosecurity policies, non-welfare farming regulations, invasive species management, fisheries policy, many development/industry activities, and so on. It is particularly easy to miss consultations in smaller jurisdictions (e.g. states and districts), even if these consultations could affect the lives of thousands or millions of animals. Some past examples, which we chose arbitrarily from a quick online search, include:","text",19

"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","Of course, the animal advocacy movement would not have been able to influence all of these policies - but the movement could have influenced many. Particularly if one considers the multitude of national, state, and local governments that are holding public consultations at any given time, this could represent a major opportunity for the animal advocacy movement to sway many policies, thereby improving the lives of animals.","text",24

"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","The use of consultations is most common in wealthier and more democratic countries, such as countries in the OECD. In contrast, authoritarian governments are not bound to hold consultations as they are less accountable to public opinion more generally.

Informal consultations are practised in virtually every OECD country(Delia Rodrigo, n.d.)and almost any country will do at least some form of limited consultation with stakeholders, even if it is especially informal.","text",48
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","Formal consultations: Refers to the standardised and regimented consultations. There will be clear rules for submissions as well as a defined notice period. These may be open to the public.","text",49
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","It can be difficult to take advantage of informal consultations since by definition they are initiated by the government, and there is no open call that others can become aware of and respond to. By their nature, informal consultations will also be more difficult to study, but we suspect that because fewer groups may be reached out to in these cases, responding to informal consultations could be particularly high-impact.","text",50
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","There may be things that groups can do to be approached more often for informal consultations, such as networking with politicians. For example, Hermansson(Hermansson 2016)finds that in the context of EU lobbying, having an office in Brussels is predictive of success, as others have found having an office in Washington is predictive of success in US lobbying(Berry 2010).","text",51
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","A form of public consultation that we see more commonly in Europe is consultations regularly posted online to a regular web portal. For example, the European Commission maintains theHave Your Sayportal for this purpose.","text",52
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","The rest of this report will refer more to formal consultations since by their nature they are easier to study and they are open for many groups to respond to, so an analysis of their impact is substantially more valuable. However, we suspect that if you are approached for an informal consultation, it will be very worthwhile to respond to it.","text",53
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","One important way that groups may be able to have a lot of impact is by responding to consultations that few other groups are responding to. To the extent to which expertise is an important factor in responding to consultations, multiple responses by groups with the same concerns may be less valuable since there will typically be significant overlap in their responses. Additionally, large consultations with a great degree of public interest are harder to  influence because various other interest groups are in competition for influence(Todorova 2020b). We would therefore not be surprised if a significant amount of the value generated by global groups working on this would be identifying and responding to more neglected consultations such as these.","text",54
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","One potential weakness of a centralised global organisation would be a lack of direct presence on the ground in key locations. This can enable networking which can provide an opportunity for organisations to be involved in consultations. Participation in informal consultations is helped by maintaining a local presence, such as an office in Brussels for EU lobbying organisations or an office in Washington for US lobbying organisations(Berry 2010; Hermansson 2016).","text",55
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","To get around this, an organisation could focus specifically on publicly accessible consultations or it could try to use the connections of local groups on the ground. They could instead be invited to these consultations and this global organisation could provide input to them. This would however require maintaining relationships with groups in many regions of the world, which could introduce some difficulties for a small organisation.","text",56

In aprevious reportwe attempted to examine the impact of lobbying with an eye to finding out how likely it is for lobbying to succeed compared to the counterfactual. Unfortunately, we found that this question is a vexed one, and no such precise numerical estimate can be taken at face value. Nevertheless, we found that there are qualitative reasons to think that lobbying may be impactful, with no one in the literature seriously believing that it has no significant effect.","text",58
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","Much of the specific literature on public consultations analyses their effects on increasing democratic participation and the feeling of democratic legitimacy. This relates to the literature on lobbying in general, which has not paid careful attention to the actual policy influence of lobbying, perhaps because of difficulty studying the subject(Mahoney 2007). Having said that, literature does exist on the efficacy of consultations in driving policy change.","text",59

"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","Typically, the guidelines suggest that the government should be very responsive to the feedback. For example, the UK government lists criterion six of the consultation exercise as  “responsiveness of consultation exercises” and writes that “All responses (both written responses and those fed in through other channels such as discussion forums and public meetings) should be analysed carefully, using the expertise, experiences and views of respondents to develop a more effective and efficient policy”(UK Government 2008).","text",63
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","However, we should expect some deviation from this in practice.

Specifically, public concerns over land use in Malta seem to have had a significant influence through consultations, mostly “large-scale developments in sensitive sites”, and public planners expressed cynicism regarding the public’s engagement with consultations. Some of the public planners responded that public participation is largely done because it is a legal requirement, not because of  a genuine desire to listen to what the public has to say. They described it as “ticking the box and saying, yes, we consulted the public”. Other public planners responded that many of the public suggestions were absurd and uninformed and were often responding to consultation out of an illegitimate motivation such as “jealousy, NIMBYism, personal vendettas”. Others said that the public simply expects politicians to defer to them even though they lack basic technical knowledge and expertise to make that reasonable. Public consultations on planning in Malta may be particularly contentious, because the country is very small and densely populated, the hard choices have to be made with the placement of infrastructure such as power plants.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","Some studies have also specifically examined the question of whether the public's submissions influence the final policy.

This can be done through demonstrating a command of the relevant literature, especially being aware of and responding to counterarguments against your position.","text",77
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","For consultations that may be difficult to push for based on pure animal welfare arguments, an approach of raising various concerns, (such as human health and environmental arguments) may be useful. This is particularly true in the case of consultations regarding insects and other invertebrates, when the welfare potential of these animals is not yet commonly considered.","text",78
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","The relative influence of different interest groups in their consultation lobbying has been relatively less studied. Despite this, the literature suggests that expertise and lobbying as a business (though some analyses suggest that this is mediated through expertise) are important success factors. This is consistent with the general literature success factors for lobbying in general(Bernhagen and Bräuninger 2005).","text",79
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","A contrasting role that consultations could be thought to play is allowing the government to identify important considerations that were missing in their analysis and to generally have their proposal critiqued.

One expert we spoke with noted that the European Commission was particularly influenced by expertise in its submissions.","text",80
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","When a government is more motivated by this factor, the best way to do well in these consultations is to focus on rigorous submissions that put forward new arguments and considerations while demonstrating engagement with counter arguments. For demonstrating expertise, the raw number of submissions is not intrinsically important. Instead, they only play the role of allowing for more distinct considerations to be presented.","text",81
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","These submissions should display a command of relevant information, including all relevant political and technical knowledge, with technical knowledge being particularly valuable.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","Some authors argue that the impact of other factors that appear to be significant on their own reduce down to expertise. For example, Todorova(Todorova 2020a)finds that businesses exert more influence on policy than do NGOs. They argue that this may be because businesses tend to have higher expertise, including greater understanding of the policy at hand, greater scientific knowledge, and greater technical knowledge.","text",83

However, this should be understood in its proper context. There is still a great deal of variation or noise in the success of consultations, so even a response demonstrating a great deal of expertise may fail to influence. Additionally, even with strong moral arguments on their side, animal advocates may struggle to do better than businesses who can pay a premium to ensure expert submissions.","text",85
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","Fraussen(Fraussen, Albareda, and Braun 2020)describes another factor by which businesses may dominate consultations.

They find that businesses have less influence in closed consultations (consultations where the government just ask particular groups for input rather than having an open publicly accessible call for submissions).","text",86
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","It is unclear why this happens, though it could be because businesses are disproportionately likely to submit to these consultations, such that a selected sample of people who the government reaches out to is more representative because it avoids this bias caused by a disproportionate number of submissions by businesses.","text",87

"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","This is in line with Bernhagen(Bernhagen, Dür, and Marshall 2015)who find that having greater expertise and information is associated with better lobbying outcomes during consultations.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","In cases where it may be hard to argue for a full ban based on pure concern for animal welfare, focusing on health concerns such as these in consultation responses can be especially valuable. Even in more difficult cases such as this, it is plausible that with greater participation in the consultation there could have been additional restrictions that could have limited the industry and improved insect welfare, as well as human health and environmental outcomes. For example, the consumption of insects can trigger allergic reactions in people who are allergic to crustaceans and there could be more regulations surrounding this.","text",124
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","53 responses in total were received to this consultation. Some of the responses were just generally in favour, with some suggesting adding new species to the proposed list allowable for human consumption or questioning restrictions on life stages allowable for consumption. Other comments asked for clarification on different points. Finally some comments presented different concerns with human consumption ranging from simple disgust or finding it to be unnatural, to a variety of specific concerns including:","text",125

"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","We think that submissions to this consultation would have been particularly impactful. This is because of the great number of animals involved, the potential to halt the industry before it gets going, and the potential to set a precedent for other countries. This is a case where one group working on consultations globally might have been particularly helpful. As a small country in a generally neglected region, there is little animal advocacy done in Singapore  from an impact focused perspective.","text",132

Only six sets of written comments were received for this consultation. Of these, three were from individuals in the feed industry, two were from associations in the feed industry and one was from an academic institution.","text",134

There are significant environmental, as well as animal welfare arguments for this, and the former in particular could have motivated some improvement in the final policy.","text",139
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","The fact that only six responses were received to this consultation, and that none of them seem to be considering animal welfare, suggests that various points may have been missed.","text",140
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","Consultation on Animal welfare labelling in the UK","text",141
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","DEFRA ran a consultation on the labelling of products in the UK according to animal welfare standards between September 13, 2021 and 6 December 2021(DEFRA 2022). The proposal was for mandatory labelling of animal products in the UK according to welfare standards used in production.","text",142
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","There were 1,633 responses, 93% from individuals and 7% from organisations. Of this, a total of 14 charities responded. The public and civil society organisations favoured mandatory labelling while the industry favoured only an industry led labelling approach, with approximately one half opposing any reform. There was broad general support for mandatory labelling of imported products. Both the animal welfare benefits as well as the consumer information and freedom arguments were widely mentioned.","text",143
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","Ultimately, a plan for a further consultation on the subject, and ultimately the whole proposal, was dropped due to heavy criticism from a coalition of industry organisations. They argued that it would be significantly more costly but would not effectively educate consumers on the issues. Specifically they argued that it was possible to achieve high welfare in different production systems, some painting them with the broad brush associated with the production system which unfairly disadvantages them of these forms(Driver 2023).","text",144
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","This response is surprising given the overwhelming agreement with the proposal. What disagreement did exist came disproportionately from those in industry and largely took issue with specific aspects of the proposal, rather than the proposal as a whole. Nevertheless, along with several other proposed animal welfare amendments and reforms, all labelling requirements were dropped.","text",145
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","We think that marginal responses to this consultation would likely have lower value as compared to consultations to which fewer organisations responded. Additionally,  the negative result seen here in the face of very high support for the reform, is an update away from the power of consultations.","text",146
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","CRUCIAL CONSIDERATIONS","text",147
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","There are two important considerations that will determine how impactful it would be to fund a small team of people focused on responding to consultations:","text",148
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","How many missed opportunities for policy influence are there? We suspect that there are many across the various national, state, and local governments around the world. But the first step of this approach would be to confirm this suspicion. This could involve a review of all consultations in all jurisdictions over the past few years; an analysis of how many submissions those consultations received fromotherinterest groups; and an analysis of how an animal advocacy organisation could have suggested policy alternatives to improve the lives of animals.","text",149
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","How often does the government incorporate proposals made in submissions? We know that the government incorporates proposalssometimes- that is, greater than 0% of the time, but less than 100% of the time. A quantitative analysis, ideally focusing on animal welfare-related consultations, would help refine this parameter and give a better estimate of how much policy influence we could expect to have. This analysis could be complemented by conducting interviews with government employees.","text",150
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","CONCLUSION AND REMAINING UNCERTAINTIES","text",151
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","Consultations provide one important avenue through which effective lobbying is possible. The public nature of them, as well as the focus on expertise provides an opportunity for a central organisation to work on this globally. A new organisation could provide value by identifying consultations that might otherwise be missed due to being in regions with few animal advocacy organisations, by being niche, or by requiring expertise not possessed by the organisations in that area. Additionally, existing organisations could consider responding to more of these consultations as they come up. The case studies section provides some examples of consultations such as these.","text",152
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","Best practices in responding to consultations centre around demonstrating expertise, with having the right connections also being important, especially to get your foot in the door. Business interests tend to have an advantage in consultations, though much of that advantage may be mediated through expertise and connections.","text",153
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","APPENDIX: OTHER ANALYSES OF CONSULTATIONS","text",154
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","A report by the European Court of Auditors(ECA 2019)analysed 26 public consultations  that took place in the EU between 2016 and 2018. They carried out a survey of the participants in addition to consulting a panel of experts. Only 5.5% of people who had participated in one of these consultations were satisfied with the process. This was done to assess a number of things including how often the European Commission made use of contributions by citizens and stakeholders. They also concluded that the European Commission needed to be better at outreach to stakeholders to receive the contributions.","text",155
"https://www.animalask.org/post/lobbying-through-public-consultation","They note that between the years of 2015 and 2018 the European Commission conducted a total of 417 public consultations. The average number there is considerably lower: around 500 participants in each of 2015 and 2016 or 2000 participants in 2017 and 2018 (excluding the top consultation with the most contributors in each year as an outlier). There is a great deal of variation in how many responses consultations receive. One of these consultations  with an outlier number of submissions took place in 2018, receiving 4.6 million responses. Though, to put this in perspective, this represents only about 1% of the EU population.","text",156

"https://www.animalask.org/post/modelling-the-outcomes-of-animal-welfare-interventions-one-possible-approach-to-the-trade-offs-betw","At Animal Ask, we spent most of 2023 conducting prioritisation research to identify the most promising goals and strategies for the animal advocacy movement. The aim of that project was to identify goals and strategies that could be more impactful than the current leading campaigns (e.g. cage-free campaigns). If we succeed, we can unlock new opportunities for the movement to help even more animals.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/modelling-the-outcomes-of-animal-welfare-interventions-one-possible-approach-to-the-trade-offs-betw","This article outlines one component of the methodology we used for that research. Specifically, to guide our research on new interventions for the animal advocacy movement, we needed a framework that allows us to quantify the subjective experiences of animals. For example, if we were comparing two campaigns—say, a) phasing out fast-growing breeds to reduce suffering in broiler chickens and b) implementing more humane pesticides to reduce suffering in wild insects killed on agricultural land—we would need to produce a quantitative estimate of the potential impact of these two campaigns.","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/modelling-the-outcomes-of-animal-welfare-interventions-one-possible-approach-to-the-trade-offs-betw","In essence, our framework allows us to systematically compare different campaign opportunities in how good they are for animals—and these comparisons can be made across different species, across different intensities of experience (e.g. mild vs extreme suffering), and across both positive and negative experiences. The framework allows us to be clear and transparent about the worldviews, philosophical positions, and/or empirical assumptions that are used in drawing conclusions about particular campaigns.","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/modelling-the-outcomes-of-animal-welfare-interventions-one-possible-approach-to-the-trade-offs-betw","In this report, we outline our framework. The key characteristics of the framework are:","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/modelling-the-outcomes-of-animal-welfare-interventions-one-possible-approach-to-the-trade-offs-betw","The framework is cumulative, meaning that it considers the total duration of an animal's experience over time. In fact, our framework is heavily based on the existing Cumulative Pain framework, which was developed by the researchers Wladimir J. Alonso and Cynthia Schuck-Paim.","text",17
"https://www.animalask.org/post/modelling-the-outcomes-of-animal-welfare-interventions-one-possible-approach-to-the-trade-offs-betw","The framework allows experiences to be adjusted. We can place different moral weights on more intense experiences—for example, we might think that preventing extreme suffering is more important than preventing mild suffering, all else being equal.","text",18
"https://www.animalask.org/post/modelling-the-outcomes-of-animal-welfare-interventions-one-possible-approach-to-the-trade-offs-betw","The framework incorporates the fact that uncertainty is high, and society has simply not made much progress on many of the core questions relating to trade-offs between different subjective experiences.","text",19
"https://www.animalask.org/post/modelling-the-outcomes-of-animal-welfare-interventions-one-possible-approach-to-the-trade-offs-betw","We advise serious caution when applying the ideas from our framework (or any framework on this topic). As any statistician knows, no model is a perfect representation of reality. When we're looking at the specific question of moral trade-offs between different subjective experiences, things get seriously murky. We view this framework as a tool to help us think quantitatively, subject to the serious limitations to society's knowledge.","text",20
"https://www.animalask.org/post/modelling-the-outcomes-of-animal-welfare-interventions-one-possible-approach-to-the-trade-offs-betw","We chose to describe our framework in this article so we can be transparent about our research methods, allowing others to see how we reach particular conclusions and to improve on our methods. We discuss the many limitations of our framework at the end of this article. Due to these limitations, this framework is only a small part of our research process. When evaluating animal advocacy interventions, we consider a range of other information interventions, many of which we have already been using before this point—these include qualitative factors (e.g. weight-of-evidence, tractability, scalability, and so on) and quantitative measures (e.g. individual animals helped, animal-years improved). The framework is mostly derived from components that are already published or well-established in the animal advocacy movement; for readers already familiar with research methods in animal advocacy, this article mostly revisits familiar ground.","text",21

"https://www.animalask.org/post/modelling-the-outcomes-of-animal-welfare-interventions-one-possible-approach-to-the-trade-offs-betw","We begin with a long list of ideas for new or existing animal advocacy campaigns.","text",25
"https://www.animalask.org/post/modelling-the-outcomes-of-animal-welfare-interventions-one-possible-approach-to-the-trade-offs-betw","For each campaign, we calculate the cumulative time in pain that would be prevented for an animal affected by the campaign, and the cumulative time in pleasure that would be created.

Pain and pleasure are each considered as four categories of different intensities (eight categories total).","text",26

In practice, we consider numerous sets of weightings, each associated with a particular worldview about the moral value of different intensities of pain and pleasure. This lets us convert the four pain categories and the four pleasure categories to a single, common metric.","text",28
"https://www.animalask.org/post/modelling-the-outcomes-of-animal-welfare-interventions-one-possible-approach-to-the-trade-offs-betw","We consider our credence in each of these worldviews, as well as a range of ""soft"", qualitative factors (e.g. tractability, scalability, and so on) to arrive at final rankings of campaign ideas.","text",29

There are major debates around what the ""best"" moral worldviews are, and even how to make decisions in light of this moral uncertainty(1,2). For our purposes, we think the best way to account for this uncertainty is ""worldview diversification"", in which we systematically incorporate information from all major/plausible moral worldviews. So, our framework needs to allow for this. For example, different worldviews might make different tradeoffs between the intensity and duration of pain, or between the value of pleasure versus pain. If a campaign idea looks particularly strong regardless of these tradeoffs(3), then we can have more confidence in that idea.","text",43

We give the full definitions of these categories in the table below. The four categories were ""grounded on (evolutionary) principles that should be common to most pain experiences: the disruptive character of the pain experience and its effectiveness to promote adaptive behaviours."" The authors give evolutionary and physiological reasons to justify why ""more unpleasant sensations should be in general more disruptive"". The names of the categories themselves are chosen to ""evoke an empathic appreciation of intensity"".

For example, some worldviews suggest that creating pleasure can compensate or ""make up"" for the existence of pain, while other worldviews think that preventing pain is far more important than creating pleasure. Most people do believe that, all else being equal, more pleasure is a good thing. Many experiments have shown that farmed animals often pay a cost in exchange for pleasure, suggesting that some forms of pleasure might outweigh, at least, some mild forms of pain. So, it is reasonable to expect that there might be some moral value to pleasure, even if this is not necessarily guaranteed (see next section for more details on these trade-offs).","text",65

"https://www.animalask.org/post/modelling-the-outcomes-of-animal-welfare-interventions-one-possible-approach-to-the-trade-offs-betw","Therefore, we might draw on similar principles in developing the categories of pleasure. Like pain, pleasure does appear to promote adaptive behaviours. But rather than indicating harm or danger as pain does, pleasure indicates usefulness. As such, pleasure does not disrupt—it attracts. So, for developing categories of pleasure, we might use these principles: ""theattractivecharacter of the pleasure experience and its effectiveness to promote adaptive behaviours"". (The evolutionary purpose of pleasure is a complex topic, and we do not do justice to the nuanced literature here, but one useful source is the seminal article by Cabanac(9)). And, as with the names given by Alonso and Schuck-Paim to the different pain categories (Annoying, Hurtful, Disabling, Excruciating), we can also pick ""terms that evoke an empathic appreciation of intensity"".","text",67
"https://www.animalask.org/post/modelling-the-outcomes-of-animal-welfare-interventions-one-possible-approach-to-the-trade-offs-betw","We make two further decisions in developing the categories of pleasure. Firstly, we choose to use four pleasure categories. Secondly, we define each pleasure category as morally equivalent to a pain category. For example, we might hypothesise that there exists a level of pleasure (let's say ""Agreeable"") that an animal would choose to experience for one hour, even if it meant experiencing one hour in the Annoying pain category. Roughly speaking, an individual in the Agreeable category is as happy as an individual in the Annoying category is sad—and so on, for the other three pairs of pain and pleasure categories. We could therefore hypothesise the existence of four different levels of pleasure, each of which is equivalent to a pain category in this way.","text",68
"https://www.animalask.org/post/modelling-the-outcomes-of-animal-welfare-interventions-one-possible-approach-to-the-trade-offs-betw","Note that we arenotdefinitively claiming that all of these levels of pleasure exist, or that they have any particular moral importance. Philosophically, many authors have argued that some pains are so extreme that they cannot be compensated for by any amount of pleasure. Future empirical work might, for example, show experimentally that animals would never pay Excruciating-category pain for any pleasure, no matter how blissful. Or we might discover that pleasure and pain might be fundamentally incomparable, as some authors have suggested. On the other hand, other authors have argued that pleasure and pain are roughly symmetrical. Since we want to consider all of these competing worldviews (see the following subsection), it is important to allow for all of these possibilities in our framework. The framework still allows for worldviews that do not place much importance on pleasure, as those worldviews can simply assign a small or zero weighting to particular categories of pleasure.","text",69

For example, cage-free campaigns lead to better lives for chickens, but the chickens are still farmed. Other interventions prevent animals from being born into farms or into the wild entirely. For example, vegan outreach campaigns may cause fewer people to purchase meat, causing the farming industry to produce fewer animals to begin with.","text",125

This is also a topic of considerable moral uncertainty—is coming into existence good(28–30)? For beings who do not yet exist, should we be valuing pain and pleasure differently(31)? Can non-existence and existence even be compared(32)? We expect that these major uncertainties will remain with us for some time.","text",129

Our framework is no different—like all similar frameworks, it suffers from numerous limitations. We apply our framework with these limitations at the fronts of our minds. Here is a short summary of the main ones:","text",146
"https://www.animalask.org/post/modelling-the-outcomes-of-animal-welfare-interventions-one-possible-approach-to-the-trade-offs-betw","It should go without saying that this framework will not be perfectly accurate. We are aiming for a level of accuracy that is comparable to other, similar frameworks—that is, sufficiently accurate for us to make the best possible decisions about animal advocacy campaigns given the available information. In animal advocacy (and, indeed, in any field), policy decisions are typically hindered by information availability.","text",147
"https://www.animalask.org/post/modelling-the-outcomes-of-animal-welfare-interventions-one-possible-approach-to-the-trade-offs-betw","Most of the general limitations raised by Holden Karnofsky(37)and Saulius Šimčikas(38)also apply to our framework, and we encourage you to read those articles if you would like more details about those limitations.","text",148
"https://www.animalask.org/post/modelling-the-outcomes-of-animal-welfare-interventions-one-possible-approach-to-the-trade-offs-betw","The most pernicious limitation, in our view, is how we address indirect effects—that is, any impact of an intervention beyond what we can capture in our framework or model. These are sometimes known as flow-through effects, knock-on effects or second-order effects, though these terms can also mean different things. Flow-through effects are critically important to understanding the effects of any policy on the lives of both animals and humans(39–43). But flow-through effects are also relevant to all policy in all fields, having been analysed in energy efficiency, criminal behaviour, and pandemic preparedness, just to name a few(44–46). When it comes to accounting for indirect effects in decision-making, there is no single, universal method. The way that we will account for indirect effects will depend on the context, and may even vary between interventions, but typically we will consider many different qualitative factors and focus on robust interventions(39,42).","text",149

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","We have a responsibility to care for the animals in our care and to provide them with the conditions necessary for their welfare. Animal welfare is also important for agricultural productivity, as higher-welfare conditions typically means mortality is lower. This can help alleviate food scarcity. Human and environmental health can also benefit from higher animal welfare.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","In this report, we focus on animal welfare in Zimbabwe. We have identified four high-priority opportunities for improving animal welfare:","text",14

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","All of these priorities appear to be very strong - even in the face of uncertainty, we would expect each of these priorities to be capable of improving the lives of millions of farmed animals. These priorities can be selected and adapted based on on-the-ground conditions, which could include existing welfare conditions, the policy landscape, and stakeholder views. We have illustrated how an ask could be chosen based on the policy landscape and stakeholder views - see the below flowchart.","text",19
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","We have also identified a number of smaller opportunities: improving chicken welfare; reducing tick-borne diseases in cattle; and improving pig welfare.","text",20

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Fish welfare is the highest priority intervention we identified in Zimbabwe. Firstly, there is currently a debate on the fish farming regulation bill, which is a great opportunity to improve welfare conditions in the fish farming industry.","text",41
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Secondly, an immense number of fish are farmed in Zimbabwe. There are already somewhere between 20 and 35 million farmed Nile tilapia alive at any one time in Zimbabwe, much higher than any other farmed vertebrate in the country(10). Further, this number is projected to roughly double by 2032(10). Zimbabwe has been described as having unrealized aquaculture potential as well as lower-than-expected rates of fish consumption, which is thought to make such an increase possible(10). Since Nile tilapia make up 99% of all farmed fish in Zimbabwe, this report will focus on tilapia(11).","text",42
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","A key stakeholder in the scaling-up of Zimbabwe’s tilapia production is the FAO and their FISH4ACP project. FISH4ACP and the Chinhoyi University of Technology conducted a study during 2021/22 about current challenges to the sector(12). This report found that cost of compliance with the current, non-centralized regulatory environment was one of the major bottlenecks in the current tilapia value chain. This report seems to be one of the major drivers behind the push to pass a new unified fisheries regulation bill by the end of 2023. The FAO is also one of the main authors of the proposed fisheries bill: “A team of legal experts from the legal division of the attorney general’s office and the FAO’s legal division will assist in collecting views and compiling the draft bill, prior to validation by the stakeholders”(12). Because the FAO has such a strong influence over the new fisheries bill, it is important that any asks are compatible with the goals of the FAO and the FISH4ACP program.","text",43
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","The main goals of the FISH4ACP program are as follows: “FISH4ACP’s priority areas include scaling-up production by improving access to quality inputs and technical know-how. Its overarching goal is to facilitate strong fish farming businesses in a conducive regulatory environment, linking smallholders to domestic and export markets as a means of reducing poverty. FISH4ACP also aims to increase employment and the contribution of aquaculture to Zimbabwe’s gross domestic product by supporting an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable fish farming sector.”(13).","text",44
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","The Zimbabwe Fish Producers Association is also closely involved with the consultation around this bill. The association has been pushing for a similar streamlining of the regulatory environment in order to reduce the cost of compliance since their establishment in 2016.","text",45
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Another key stakeholder is Lake Harvest Aquaculture, which is by far the largest producer of farmed Nile tilapia in Zimbabwe. LHA produces nearly 90% of Zimbabwe’s farmed Nile tilapia(13). LHA’s farm on Lake Kariba uses large offshore cages, with each cage containing 100 tonnes of fish at any one time(14). Even though the goals of the FAO are more focused on attaining economic benefits for smallholder producers, the content of the bill will be shaped by the economic interests of LHA. The bill's impact on LHAs production methods should be a primary consideration for animal advocates.","text",46
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Note that LHA exports around 65% of its fish to neighbouring countries, primarily Zambia(15). This means that legislation affecting domestic production will be much more impactful than legislation affecting the sale of tilapia within Zimbabwe.","text",47

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","The paper by Pedrazzani et al, ""Tilapia On-Farm Welfare Assessment Protocol for Semi-intensive Production Systems""(16). While useful, this paper does have a number of weaknesses: it is unclear what stocking densities are ideal for different production methods; it is unclear how well the protocol generalises to the production methods used in Zimbabwe; and the protocol is fairly insensitive to sub-clinical welfare issues, and so getting near-perfect scores is easier than it should be.","text",50
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","The Fair-Fish Database entry on Nile tilapia (link). This database entry has a list of recommendations for improving the welfare of Nile tilapia on farms.","text",51
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Which fish welfare policies should be pursued?","text",52
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Since the fisheries regulation bill will be passed in the next few months, influencing it is the most urgent priority around influencing fish farming in Zimbabwe. Since a law cannot include the same level of detail as future regulation might, these asks will be more general than the rest.","text",53
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","The first ask is to advocate for the bill to include a clause like: ‘As future production systems intensify and increase in scale, animal welfare should remain a central priority of producers and regulators’. Though a clause like this would not in itself require anything concrete from producers, it can help to get animal welfare on the regulatory agenda and provide the basis for future welfare reforms.","text",54
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","The second ask is to advocate for the bill to require fish welfare training. Specifically, it would be good for the bill to require people who handle and slaughter fish to undergo training in humane handling and fish welfare indicators. The training could involve consultation with aquaculture training institutes and educators, or online courses (e.g. the welfare indicator modelhere). In the interests of not imposing additional burdens on smallholder farmers, much of the welfare impact of this ask could be preserved by requiring training only for farms that produce more than a particular volume of fish. Even if training is only required for LHA staff, the ask would still retain much of its welfare impact. However, the impact of compliance based on training and the use of this app has yet to be established in this case, and there is certainly potential for compliance to be worse in practice than is expected.","text",55
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Next, we consider asks that could apply to future codes of practice. These asks can be split into two categories: those that apply to both cage and pond production systems, and those which only apply to pond production systems. In both cases these asks are more detailed than those in the prior section. Since there are no current plans for industry regulation more detailed than the fisheries bill, these asks are less urgent.","text",56
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","The first ask relevant to both cage and pond systems is a limit on stocking density. Due to the variety of welfare needs associated with tilapia at different life-stages and in different production systems, a single density requirement is not appropriate. The stocking density goals for pond and cage systems used by Pedrazzani et al(16)are a good starting point. However, before trying to introduce these as benchmarks for Zimbabwean producers, further consultation with experts in Zimbabwean production systems or tilapia welfare would be beneficial. Additionally, because of the centralization of the industry in cage systems with Lake Harvest and the difficulty of enforcing regulations on informal pond systems, starting with regulations on cage systems could be sensible.","text",57
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","The second ask relevant to both cage and pond production systems would be limiting the amount of time fish can spend out of water before slaughter or stunning. The shorter this time, the better as fish are asphyxiating and otherwise greatly suffering while out of water. Moreover, it has not been established that putting fish on ice in these cases solves this problem, indeed it may make it worse(18). However, in the interests of feasibility, the specific time limits would have to be partly determined by how easy compliance would be for producers.","text",58
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Finally, though it may be more promising  to focus on cages, two asks which are primarily relevant for pond production systems are:","text",59
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Monitoring and controlling water quality. The model for water quality monitoring found in the Pedrazzani et al. paper(16), with its focus on dissolved oxygen levels, provides a good model for Zimbabwean regulation. Although we expect that lack of knowledge and control over water quality would make these difficult to enfoce as presented.","text",60
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Environmental enrichment in ponds. The most important aspect of environmental enrichment is the provision of substrate in artificial ponds. This is important because wild Nile tilapia use substrate to burrow and build nests. As such, including this substrate in pond systems might be a good intervention with significant welfare benefits.","text",61
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","One final point is not strictly relevant to the welfare of the fish themselves, but is still significant. The FAO FISH4ACP program is trialling the use of black soldier fly larvae as a feed for Nile tilapia in Zimbabwe. Though the practice seems to be found only in small trials so far, it may lead to insect suffering on an immense scale(19,20). We strongly recommend that all opportunities be taken to prevent the use of black soldier fly larvae in fish feed in Zimbabwe.","text",62
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Another practice that has very significant welfare impacts is the use of humane slaughter methods or stunning. While regulation that required this would be very beneficial for fish welfare, the very high cost of compliance makes it unrealistic for a relatively low-value fish like tilapia, especially in the Zimbabwean context.","text",63
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Having said this, the centralization of the industry in Zimbabwe could mean that working with Lake Harvest to get stunning adopted could be very impactful. This could possibly be done through having a single vessel with stunning capacity and this could be particularly cost-effective even if subsidies are required. This might be of particular interest to funders. We would be happy to provide more information on this.","text",64
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Priority 2: Preventing industrial animal farming","text",65
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Advocating against the growth of industrialised animal farming in Zimbabwe is an extremely high priority in Zimbabwe in principle. The only reason that this was not included as the top priority is that we suspect that this may be especially difficult to achieve in practice in Zimbabwe. Nevertheless, we think that this is an extremely high-impact campaign in principle and we wanted to include it as a guiding ideal. This campaign would aim to stop or slow the growth of industrialised farming, and instead favour extensive or free-range farming.","text",66
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","By industrialised animal farming, we mean the system of commercial animal farming that involves large-scale, indoor facilities, where animals are 'confined indoors under strictly controlled conditions'(1). Industrialised animal farming uses intensive production methods like battery cages and gestation crates, and this system is generally designed to maximise profits and minimise costs(1). The specifics of the policy would determine which exact practices are banned or prevented. In contrast, extensive animal farming involves natural environments, where animals can  express natural behaviours, such as exploration, grazing, and exercise(2). The pastoral and free-range systems that are used by small-scale households in Zimbabwe are examples of extensive production systems.","text",67
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","There are many ways to encourage the government to support extensive production rather than industrial/intensive production. This could help the government avoid the public health and environmental problems that have been caused by industrialised animal farming in developed countries (see Appendix 2: Animal Welfare and One Health). Specifically, supporting extensive and free-range production would enable agricultural income to be dispersed to many households, particularly those experiencing poverty, rather than to a handful of large, commercial companies. Likewise, this could enable the government to position themselves as a leader in sustainable agricultural policy on both the regional and global stage, especially considering the progress being made on animal welfare on the level of the African Union(3,4).","text",68
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","The benefits from preventing the growth of industrialised animal farming in Zimbabwe would fall into three categories.","text",69
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Firstly, farmed animals would likely experience conditions that are better for their welfare. Intensive animal farming involves confining animals in large, densely populated buildings. This usually stops animals from experiencing freedoms and natural behaviours that are essential for their welfare, and there are many specific harms involved with industrial production systems (e.g. painful mutilations, health problems caused by using fast-growing breeds)(5,6). Indeed, the major animal welfare campaigns currently taking place in developed countries focus on phasing out the worst practices of industrialised farming, like keeping hens in cages(7). If Zimbabwe did not pursue intensive animal farming, and instead favoured extensive or free-range farming, then the conditions that cause immense suffering to animals would be averted.","text",70
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Secondly, this campaign in Zimbabwe would be extremely valuable for animal advocates in other developing countries. If this campaign is successful in Zimbabwe, then it would be a watershed moment - the campaign could be replicated in other countries around the world, magnifying its impact substantially and improving the lives of hundreds of millions or even billions of animals worldwide.","text",71
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Thirdly, there may be fewer animals farmed overall. Industrialised farming systems were developed to farm a very large number of animals very cheaply. Extensive or free-range farming would produce a smaller number of animals, which could mean that fewer animals are born into lives of suffering. This would depend on whether Zimbabweans' demand for meat remains relatively low, or whether the demand increases but is met by free-range production or even imports from other countries.","text",72

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","A strong case can be made that industrialised animal agriculture is incompatible with these constitutional rights.","text",79
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","The key question is whether it is possible to prevent the growth of industrialised animal farming in Zimbabwe - or, indeed, in any country. Our recent research suggests preventing or significantly slowing the development of industrial animal farming may be a feasible goal in some developing countries (research availablehere). The most critical uncertainty is whether a government would be willing to consider the possibility of stopping industrialised farming. We suspect this may not be true in the case of Zimbabwe, but if this is true we would consider this the strongest ask in the country.","text",80
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","The most general barrier to achieving this goal is the perceived conflict between animal welfare and various humanitarian and economic pressures. Framing this policy in terms of win-wins will be critical to attracting the support of government and other stakeholders. These win-win options include overlaps between animal welfare objectives and objectives around environmental concerns, human health, economic profitability, food security, and employment. The One Health concept captures some of these overlaps, and Zimbabwean stakeholder’s familiarity with the concept makes it an excellent frame for promoting these win-win options in conversation with policymakers. The following paragraphs will identify a number of these overlaps.","text",81
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","At the national level, animal welfare interests can sometimes overlap with the economic interests associated with export-oriented animal agriculture. If Zimbabwe wants to target export markets that have stricter regulations on animal product imports, then domestic producers have an incentive to meet these regulations. These regulations can either directly require certain standards of animal welfare from producers, or indirectly benefit animals by requiring the products to be disease-free. While regional African export markets may have less strict regulations, if stakeholders eventually want to target wealthier export markets they have an incentive to eventually bring their production standards in line with these more demanding import regulations.","text",82
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","A good example of these economic incentives leading to improved animal welfare outcomes is theFarm Assured Namibian Meatscheme. If stakeholders within a particular industry have exports to stricter markets as a medium or long-term goal, they may be receptive to piloting higher welfare production methods as early trials, or simply requiring higher-welfare production methods from the beginning.","text",83
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","At smaller scales, it seems plausible that many of the gains in productivity associated with larger-scale, more intensive production may actually be a result of the improved market access available to larger firms. This suggests that many of the economic goals that push producers to larger-scale, more intensive production can actually be met by programs that improve the market access of small-scale producers. Since smaller producers are also often better from an environmental and public health perspective, improving the market access of small producers can satisfy a number of overlapping goals. Snyder et al. (2020)(8)and a report by UNIDO analysing Tanzania red meat value chain(9)make a convincing case that this model is true in Tanzania:","text",84
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Other overlaps between animal welfare and other goals are often more specific to particular contexts and particular stakeholders. These can include a focus on the negative environmental or land-use effects of intensive animal agriculture, the increased risks of zoonotic diseases, or the improvements in food security smallholder farming with indigenous breeds can often provide. If there are stakeholders such as NGOs whose goals align with these, collaborating with these organisations can be a win-win option for both animal welfare and other goals.","text",85

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","There are significant gaps in Zimbabwe's animal welfare legislation (see discussion on legislation below).

However, generally speaking, chickens are likely to experience welfare problems in: breed, stocking density, litter and air quality, temperature, light and other equipment, nutrition, handling, transport, and stunning and slaughter (28). For fish, the major welfare problems generally include: water quality, space requirements and stocking density, feed composition, stunning and slaughter, and environmental enrichment (29). Similar lists can be produced for goats, cows, sheep, and pigs. A comprehensive welfare standard would cover all of these areas. For more information about what these welfare standards could contain, see the sections in this report on tilapia, chickens, pigs, and tick-borne diseases.","text",94

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Our fourth priority is expanding plant-based diet outreach campaigns.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","The animal advocacy movement regularly invests resources into campaigns that aim to reduce people's consumption of meat and/or animal products.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","There is some evidence supporting these campaigns(21–23)and given the evidence we have available, our conservative estimate is that these campaigns spare 0.5 animals per dollar in some contexts.","text",98
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","One way to deliver meat-reduction outreach campaigns that may be particularly suitable for Zimbabwe is to use mass media (including radio, TV, newspapers, and the internet). Mass media campaigns have been in a variety of contexts to achieve human behavioural change(24–31). These contexts include campaigns to prevent smoking, to encourage contraceptive use, to encourage healthier eating, among other uses. Such campaigns are particularly promising in developing countries, where radio appears to be very cost-effective(30).","text",99

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","We estimate that Zimbabwe has a population of around 10.5 million chickens in commercial systems, 70% of which  are raised in relatively extensive systems. Most of these (90%) are farmed for meat, and some (10%) are farmed for eggs. In addition, more than 90% of households keep chickens(32)with the total population of these “village” or “backyard” chickens possibly reaching 30 million(33).

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","This year marks the start of a large government campaign to combat tick-borne diseases in Zimbabwe. This campaign has involved: systematic livestock dipping; the provision of 1 kg of tick grease to 1 million farmers, as a supplement to dipping; and making failure to dip cows an arrestable offence(35). Additionally, 200,000 BOLVAC vaccine doses against ticks have now been produced(36). There are further plans to produce vaccine doses for other tick-borne diseases. The government's campaign has shown enormous success so far, with cattle mortality this year down by 47% compared to the previous year(37).","text",115
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","We applaud efforts by the government and farmers to make progress on this issue. We recommend that the government and animal advocacy organisations continue this work. This work is particularly valuable because of 1) the extremely high mortality rate caused by tick-borne diseases, 2) the high population of cows in Zimbabwe, and 3) economic benefits from this intervention (lower cattle mortality). Having said this, we did not include this among our top priorities because decisive action is already being taken to combat the diseases.","text",116
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Tick-borne disease is a leading cause for farmed animal mortality in Zimbabwe, amounting to 55% of all cow deaths(11). The main such diseases are Babesiosis, Anaplasmosis, Heartwater, and Theileriosis (also known as January disease).","text",117
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Regularly dipping cows in an insecticide treatment according to a specific schedule has been the most common method of managing the disease. However, cattle mortality is still higher than would be ideal, despite the use of cattle dipping. This may be due to errors with implementation(38). If some dips are missed or the dips are otherwise not conducted properly, the ticks can survive to reproduce and evolve to become more resistant to the insecticide.","text",118
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Because of the difficulty at expense of these methods, the possibility of vaccinating cattle against ticks has long been considered. Zimbabwe has developed a version of this vaccine, the BOLVAC vaccine. This vaccine has been found to be safe and efficacious(39). Despite the early development, it was discontinued in the 1990s because of inadequate financing and technical staff turnover(38). However, this has recently changed.","text",119

One expert we spoke to estimated that fewer than 20% of Zimbabwe's pigs are part of this scheme. This certification carries important pig welfare legislation, but it only applies to a small proportion of the country's pig production. In the slaughter section of the ZQAP scheme, no specific methods of slaughter or conditions to be fulfilled are specified. Stress caused to pigs is only evoked in the specific consequence for the quality of the meat. Also, the text needs to be more specific in order to ensure better welfare at all stages of pig farming and handling. It would be beneficial to expand the scheme to cover more of the country's pigs, to refine the text of the certification scheme to make it more specific, and advocate to include the provisions of the certification scheme in the Animal Health Act.","text",128

Similarly, “Kicking, the use of electric prodders, whips, metal rods, heavy sticks or other objects liable to injure or terrify pigs are all forbidden”(40). However, the use of anaesthetics is not mentioned during routine procedures such as Tail docking, clipping, ear notching and tattooing of piglets up to 7 days of age. These procedures are considered to be very painful for pigs [reference] and should be rendered pain free by implementing routine analgesics administered by trained staff.","text",129

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","The primary piece of animal welfare legislation in Zimbabwe is the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act(44).","text",145
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","This Act does not explicitly mention the sentience of animals or their intrinsic moral worth. This reflects a failure to respond to scientific information about the sentience of animals and increased moral awareness of their welfare, since the writing of this Act over 60 years ago and its last update 20 years ago.","text",146
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Invertebrates are also excluded from the Act, meaning that the farmed bee population in Zimbabwe has no protection. This is despite many recent studies strongly suggesting that bees can feel pain, meaning that we are responsible for the welfare of bees under our care(45).","text",147
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","The Act lacks specificity. For example, the Act establishes that an offence occurs when somebody “cruelly or unnecessarily ties up or confines any animal or causes or permits any animal to be tied up or confined”. While this seems reasonable on the face of it, “cruelty” is not defined. Anyone wishing to excuse their own behaviour or the behaviour of others could interpret the term in a narrow light. Adding more specificity makes it harder for people to rationalise bad behaviour as meeting the standard set in the Act.","text",148
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Further, “confined” is not defined or elaborated on in the act. A reasonable interpretation of this might prohibit some specific practices, including perhaps the use of cages for egg-laying hens, but there is no further elaboration in the Act. Greater specificity could resolve these ambiguities and lead to higher welfare on farms.","text",149
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Greater specificity is often achieved through the writing of codes of practices for the major groups of animals used in a particular country. Zimbabwe does not have any codes of regular codes of practice for animals, and the development of these codes should be a legislative aspiration for the country. We see this as the most important legislative goal for animal welfare in Zimbabwe.","text",150
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Other legislation exists that might touch on animal welfare is the Animal Health Act (2001)(47).","text",151
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","This Act does not explicitly mention animals’ wellbeing, specific states of health, or the alleviation of suffering during painful procedures (e.g. tail docking).","text",152
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","This Act empowers a Minister to “order destruction of wild animals.” This cause has no details about how this “destruction” has to be carried out. Destruction of wild animals can imply the destruction not only of their lives by killing them, but also target their habitat which could also be detrimental to human health. More detailed information is therefore needed to define in what cases wild animals are concerned and how this decision affects animals wellbeing, the environment, and human health. This should specify that humane methods be used, as well as considering other options first (e.g. neutering animals).","text",153
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","Finally, the deficiencies in the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act are compounded by ineffectual fines. The fine is currently ZWL $200 for an initial infraction, which is extremely cheap for a criminal offence(48). Where fines are too small, fines can be seen as simply the cost of doing business for farms, potentially leading to widespread violations of animal welfare.","text",154
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-zimbabwe","More specific animal welfare language is found in the Zimbabwe Quality Assured Pork Scheme (ZQAP)(40). The ZQAP only applies to pigs, and only a small proportion of the country's pigs (below 20%). In this code, animal welfare is explicitly addressed by including the five freedoms (freedom from malnutrition, thermal physical discomfort, injury, normal behaviour, and fear and stress). However, this is a voluntary code rather than being legally required by all pig farmers in Zimbabwe. Though it still has some significant deficiencies, the code is an improvement on standard animal welfare requirements in Zimbabwe, and represents a source of potential inspiration for future welfare reforms. It is clear that these standards work for a significant proportion of pig farmers in Zimbabwe, and so the concept has been proved in this natural trial. The certification scheme is discussed in further detail in the below section on pig welfare.","text",155

"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY","text",10
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","Many animal advocacy organisations have considered campaigning to improve the welfare of animals during transport. Since the animal advocacy movement has limited resources, it is important to focus on the campaigns and asks that generate the largest improvements in the lives of animals. Is transport the best focus for animal advocacy campaigns, or should the movement's focus be elsewhere? In this report, we take a first look at that question.","text",11
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","The transport of live farmed animals is very common, and situations will differ in every country and for every species. It would be prohibitively time-consuming to systematically compare the transport of every species of farmed animal in every country. We have based our main argument on three case studies, which provide illustrative examples of the treatment of farmed animals during transport for a range of species, countries, and industries. While this report is not a systematic comparison of all aspects of animal welfare during transport, it is sufficient as a first look at whether transport should be a major focus for the farmed animal advocacy movement.","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","The four sections within this report can be read mostly separately. Feel free to focus on the sections that are most relevant for you and your work.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","In Part 1 (two pages long), we present the case that improving animal welfare during transport should not currently be a priority for animal advocacy organisations. We consider how farmed animals might benefit from reforming laws around animal transport. We compare transport campaigns to other campaigns that the movement can pursue instead (e.g. on-farm welfare reform and slaughter reform). Overall, we expect that transport reform will benefit animals far less than other types of campaigns - animals experience transport for only a very short period of their lives (less than 1% of animal-years). Of course, we always find it emotionally challenging to recommend that a particular group of animals should not be a focus of campaigns, but it is important that the animal advocacy movement's limited resources go towards doing as much good for animals as possible.","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","In Part 2 (two pages long), we summarise the times when itwouldbe a good use of resources for animal advocacy organisations to campaign for better animal welfare during transport. For example, animal advocacy organisations may occasionally have the opportunity to push for higher-welfare transport regulations with only a small investment of time and energy. Transport could form one part of an overarching welfare campaign that also focuses on other parts of the animals' lives. If you are aware of particular transport reforms that could be costly to the farming industry, this could help make farming less profitable (though we haven't yet seen any examples of this). Also, there may be opportunities to improve transport regulations when existing standards or regulations come up for public consultation and review, or when animal transport catastrophes are publicised in the media. For organisations that are nevertheless keen to campaign to improve animal welfare during transport, we provide links to some resources that can help you to develop new welfare asks in your own country or jurisdiction.","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","In Appendix 1 (15 pages long), we focus on Poland. We examine three asks relating to animal welfare during transport: improving enforcement, improving temperature limits, and decreasing journey times. We conclude that improving temperature limits and decreasing journey times could bring some benefits to animals transported in Poland, though - as explained in Part 1 of the report - the benefits are likely to be fairly small.","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","In Appendix 2 (9 pages long), we illustrate the background to animal welfare during transport by examining three case studies from around the world: the transport of chickens in the European Union, the live export of sheep and cows from Australia, and the live transport of fish in China. We chose these case studies to illustrate the problems with live animal transport across a variety of species, industries, and countries. All three of these case studies arrive at similar conclusions: there are numerous welfare challenges facing the animals, and suffering appears to be common. However, transport accounts for a very small proportion of the lives of farmed animals. In all three cases, when you account for the animals who are farmed but not transported, less than 1% of the lives of farmed animals are experienced during transport. This means that the benefits of reforming animal welfare during transport, while potentially meaningful for the animals affected, would only prevent a very small amount of the suffering imposed on animals by farming. This supports our general case that improving animal welfare during transport should not currently be a priority for animal advocacy organisations.","text",17
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","PART 1: IMPROVING ANIMAL WELFARE DURING TRANSPORT IS OFTEN LESS EFFECTIVE THAN OTHER ASKS","text",18
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","In this section, we compare transport reforms to other animal welfare reforms. We consider general transport reform, general slaughter reform, and two well-understood animal welfare reforms on-farm (cage-free, and the Better Chicken Commitment). A substantial part of the farmed animal advocacy movement focuses on cage-free campaigns, Better Chicken Commitment campaigns, and slaughter reform - as such, these are appropriate benchmarks against which we can compare a potential transport campaign.","text",19
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","Our analysis concludes that across all of the metrics considered (e.g. number of animals affected, duration of suffering prevented per animal, intensity of suffering), transport reform is less competitive than on-farm welfare reforms. Transport reforms may prevent a longer duration of suffering than slaughter reform, but the suffering is still likely to be less intense.","text",20
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","In short, if you want to help animals as much as possible, it makes more sense to campaign for on-farm welfare reforms or slaughter reforms, not transport reforms.","text",21
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","This analysis is supported by the three case studies (discussed in more detail in Appendix 2). As this analysis is hindered by a lack of information in some areas, we also give our rough confidence level for each claim.","text",22
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","The total proportion of an average farmed animal's life that is spent in transport is typically very small (90% confidence). For example, our case studies found that the percentage of an animal's life spent in transport is 0.4 - 1.2% for chickens in the EU; 1.1 - 8.5% for sheep and cows exported live from Australia; 0.05% for fish transported in China (Appendix 2).","text",23
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","In countries with existing animal welfare regulations during transport, further animal welfare reforms would typically bring about minor improvements (60% confidence). This claim may not apply in contexts where there are no animal welfare regulations during transport (e.g. fish in China).","text",24
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","Most of the suffering experienced due to transport is minor or moderate pain, rather than extreme pain (55% confidence). For argument's sake, if we imagine thatall ofthe suffering experienced during transport is extreme pain (which is highly unlikely), transport reform could still only prevent a few hours of extreme pain per animal at most. This might make transport appear more competitive than slaughter reform, but not more competitive than cage-free reforms or the Better Chicken Commitment. (Some people believe that it is most urgent to prevent suffering that is extreme, which makes slaughter reform appear even more competitive.)","text",25
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","This analysis is also made more difficult by the fact that transport practices vary across species, country, and industry. If you are campaigning for, or considering campaigning for, better animal welfare during transport, feel free toreach out to us at Animal Ask. We can discuss your specific region and help you identify what asks would best improve the lives of animals for you and your organisation.","text",26
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","PART 2: SUPPORT HIGHER-WELFARE TRANSPORT WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES","text",27
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","In Part 1 of this report, we explained why the animal advocacy movement might not want to make transport a major focus of its campaigns.","text",28
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","To be clear, governments, producers, and retailers should always be strongly encouraged to improve welfare during transport when the opportunity arises. There are times when animal advocacy organisations can push for improvements in animal transport regulations and standards with a relatively low investment of resources:","text",29
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","An animal advocacy organisation could include transport as one part of an overarching welfare ask that also improves many other aspects of animals' lives.","text",30
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","When regulations or standards come up for review, there is often an opportunity for the public and organisations to submit their views. This is a relatively low investment of energy (i.e. preparing and submitting a single document), but it can nevertheless encourage the government or other body to consider improvements to animal welfare standards in transport.","text",31
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","Occasionally, there are high-profile events relating to animal transport that are publicised in the media. For example, a ship from the EU that capsized in 2019, killing 14,000 sheep(4), and there have also been multiple instances of highly-publicised animal welfare catastrophes in the Australian live export industry(5). (Sometimes these media stories are the result of investigations or publications by animal advocacy organisations.) When these events occur, they naturally generate a lot of public outrage, and it makes perfect sense to focus this outrage on achieving reforms for animals in transport. At this time, animal advocacy organisations could encourage policymakers or corporations to adopt higher animal welfare standards, given the public attention.","text",32
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","It is possible that there are some ways that transport reform could be costly to the farming industry. We haven't seen any examples of this, but it is possible that there are particular policies in any given country that could impose large costs on producers and farming companies. This could help make the farming industry less profitable, which might lead to the industry farming fewer animals.

Overall, we recommend that campaigning on transport is not the best use of resources for animal advocacy organisations.

Data is scarce, which means that the impact of this ask is highly uncertain and risks being small or negligible. But it is possible that this ask could reduce suffering from heat and cold stress on some journeys. This would only affect animals who are transported during extreme temperatures and only for the duration of those journeys, and this would only prevent suffering for some of those animals.","text",63
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","Decrease journey lengths: We believe that this ask would be promising for a campaign. There is strong evidence that shorter journey lengths improve the welfare of transported chickens. However, even if this ask resulted in relatively strict limits on journey durations, the total effect would mostly be to shave a couple of hours off of the end of 20-30% of journeys. Again, this might be a small, meaningful improvement for the animals affected, though it would only benefit those animals for a couple of hours each.","text",64
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","In the remainder of this Appendix, we give a general discussion about each of these asks, and we also conduct some calculations to estimate the impact of each of these asks quantitatively. The general discussion is given at the top of the section for each ask. The calculations are then detailed. The results of the calculations are visualised in Figure A1. The calculations are only approximations, so they should be considered as nothing more than initial, back-of-the-envelope calculations.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","There is one assumption that applies to all three asks: in our calculations, we only consider chickens. Of course, the asks would apply to other farmed animals too (e.g. pigs, cows, and so on). However, considering only one group of animals makes the calculations much more straightforward for the third ask (""Decrease journey lengths""), as each different group of animals have different journey lengths. It is important for our calculations to be comparable across the three asks, so we consider only chickens across all three asks. We do not think that explicitly adding other groups of farmed animals to the calculations would add much more information in terms of decision-making. Chickens account for roughly 97% of farmed land animals transported in Poland, according to the report commissioned by Otwarte Klatki(27). This is also true across the EU in general(7,28). So, considering only chickens allows us to capture almost all of the impact of each ask.","text",66

To clarify, there is already an enforcement system in place - while this system is far from perfect, it does appear to be doing a decent job of preventing many animal welfare violations.

We don't know whether regulating the internal or the external temperature would lead to better outcomes for chickens (see discussions in official EU and UK reports(7,8)).

This is a necessary assumption because we don't have any data on when journeys actually occur. In fact, it is likely that journeys are non-random and more likely to take place at some times of day than others, and at some times of year than others - companies might tend to avoid transporting on days with extreme temperatures anyway, due to increased mortality and practical difficulties, though we're speculating here. Together, these first two assumptions allow us to use historical temperature data from Poland to make approximate guesses about the percentage of journeys that would be restricted by any particular temperature limit.","text",131

In this case, the industry would be forced to reconfigure all journeys that are currently above 8 hours. We can guess that the average journey length would then be a little bit below 8 hours, as the industry's response may involve building new slaughterhouses around the country.

But it is possible that this would likely just reduce those journey lengths to about 6 - 8 hours. So, for the 11% of journeys of 8 - 12 hours, these journeys might be reduced to 6 - 8 hours. For the 16% of journeys of greater than 12 hours, these journeys might also be reduced to 6 - 8 hours. The total effect of this new limit would therefore be something like: the journey time of 11% of chickens is reduced by about 3 hours, and the journey time of 16% of chickens is reduced by about 7 hours.

Since DOA is strongly related to welfare, this is solid evidence that shorter journey times can improve welfare. While this is valuable information, the data is at the level of the flock, not the individual.

On the ships, the major stressors are likely to be disease, heat stress, high stocking densities, high ammonia levels, food availability, stress, noise, and disturbance to lighting patterns. The whole process, beginning on farms in Australia and ending with slaughter in the importing country, can last 1-2 months during which the animals can be handled 5-6 times. Phillips and Santurtun(61)concluded that 'there are significant risks to the welfare of livestock caused by transporting them in ships, especially over long distances'. And Foster and Overall(50)point out that, compared to other live-exporting countries, Australia's live export involves much longer distances and journeys. They also discuss the poor enforcement and problems with the regulatory regime.","text",213
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","There have also been some major incidents publicised in the media. In 2017-18, the media published undercover footage, taken on voyages from Australia to the Middle East and provided by Animals Australia, that showed sheep on the voyages experiencing severe suffering(60,62). This motivated the government to commission an independent review into the standards of sheep exported to the Middle East and to accelerate the review timeline for the broader standards that apply to the entire live export industry (see above reviews). There were similar publicised incidents in 2011 when Animals Australia conducted an investigation into conditions in slaughterhouses in Indonesia, and 2012, when a shipload of allegedly diseased sheep were slaughtered en masse in Pakistan. Following the 2011 incident, the federal government attempted to place stricter regulations on the industry, though this was later ruled unlawful in a court decision(63,64).","text",214
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","The above evidence suggests that intense suffering during live export from Australia could be common, despite government attempts to improve regulations.","text",215
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","Notably, Australia's live export industry has steadily declined in numbers over the past few years. In the 2021/22 financial year, there were 1.1 million animals exported - this is a substantial decline from the 2.9 million in 2017/18(52). This decline has occurred in the context of stricter regulations on the live export industry(62). The Labor government currently in power in Australia has committed to phasing out the industry over time(5).","text",216
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","It is also worth noting that the animals exported live from Australia are often grown further by farmers in the importing country. For this period of the animals' lives, the animals' welfare would be governed by the laws in the importing country, not Australia. It is possible that the importing countries have weaker animal welfare laws than Australia does. But Australia's animal welfare laws are not great(65,66), so this is not certain and could be worth investigating further. Abolishing live export from Australia would mean that the animals spend their entire lives in Australia with their welfare governed by Australia's laws, rather than part of their lives in the importing country. Likewise, if animals experience injuries and psychological trauma from transport, a longer period between transport and slaughter might increase the suffering that is caused by these problems. Both of these factors could provide additional benefits of banning live export. Merely reforming the conditions on live export ships, as opposed to banning live export entirely, would not have this effect.","text",217
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","Case study 3: Transport of fish in China","text",218
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","Our third case study is the live transport of fish in China. We chose this industry due to its immense scale - fish are the most numerous group of farmed vertebrates2(67), and China is the country that farms the most fish by far(68,69). In fact, in any given year, there are almost as many farmed fish slaughtered in China than there are farmed land animals slaughtered on the entire planet(6,68,69). The evidence suggests that almost all fish farmed in China are transported live, as customers typically have a preference for live or freshly killed fish(70,71). Notably, around 7% of fish produced in China die during transport3(71,72). This not only means  that the transport of fish in China is the largest of live vertebrates on the planet, but also that the fish might experience immense suffering during this transport.","text",219
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","In this case study, we only consider transport of fish from farm to market. It is possible that fish are transported at other points in their lives too (e.g. the transport of fry(71)), but we have not looked into that. We only consider domestic transport - for a comparison between domestic and international markets for fish produced in China, see Zhang et al(73)and Zhang et al(74).","text",220
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","Generally speaking, common welfare problems experienced by fish during live transport involve stocking density, handling, water quality, water movement, loading and unloading, physical damage, air exposure, and food deprivation(12–14,71). Handling and transport commonly cause acute and chronic stress, with transported fish showing physiological stress responses(12,71). Welfare needs differ depending on species, life stage, and environment(12).","text",221
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","In China specifically, there are a few sources that provide details about the experiences of fish during live transport.","text",222
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","Pond loaches are one of the most numerous fish species farmed in China(69), and most or all of the pond loaches farmed in China are probably transported live. Most pond loaches farmed in China appear to be sold locally, though some are exported to Korea or Taiwan(76).","text",223
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","Yang et al(71)conducted interviews with stakeholders involved in live fish transport in China. Fish are typically transported in sealed tanks or, for small-scale transport, plastic bags or foam boxes. Before transport, fish are often captured manually using dipnets, or sometimes with pumps or cage traps. Loading can occur a few hours before transport starts, and there may also be a wait between transport and unloading. Customers may take fish home alive in sealed plastic bags. Live transport typically happens in winter rather than summer, as summer temperatures can cause poorer fish health and lower survival rates. The use of anaesthetics is uncommon. Some respondents believed that aquatic animals were not sentient, or that animal welfare is only relevant to land animals, though others believed that welfare should be considered for fish as it is for land animals.","text",224
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","Jia et al(75)reports on the transport of three species: Chinese perch, largemouth bass, and longsnout catfish. Together, these species account for about 3% of fish farmed in China. Jia et al's study examines transport from production in Guandong province to wholesalers in Beijing. Wholesalers report mortality with reports varying from very low (e.g. 0%) to very high (e.g. 60% or even 100% in some cases). Before transport, fish are captured on farms and moved to containers filled with pond water and equipped with oxygen cylinders. These containers are taken via truck to company processing plants where fish are unloaded and sorted into tanks before being anaesthetised with carbon dioxide and kept in holding tanks for 3 - 12 hours. During the main journey, fish are transported in water and ice in styrofoam boxes, which are connected to an oxygen cylinder. Each box is about 26 litres and can hold 10 - 25 kg of fish (roughly 15 - 30 individuals). Each truck carries up to 600 boxes. The journey is 2,300 km, which takes 30 - 48 hours. Fish can be offloaded directly to wholesalers or transferred to another truck for transport to other markets. When the fish arrive at the market, it can be 1 - 3 hours until the customer receives the fish.","text",225
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","Nie et al(77)give an overview of live fish transport in China. There are many different transportation methods and packaging methods, depending on the journey distance, the volume of fish being transported, the customer (e.g. wholesalers vs restaurants), etc. While other countries often use specialist transport vehicles, Chinese fish transport instead involves modified trucks. This makes it more difficult to control the environment during transportation, which contributes to the low survival rate of fish. The use of anaesthesia can improve the survival rate and increase the transport density. The authors discuss the development of ""less water"" and ""no water"" transportation techniques, which first originated in Japan. This involves inducing a state of dormancy in the fish and transporting the fish in containers with very little or no water, before awakening the fish at the end of the journey. This technique is being developed in China, though it has not yet seen widespread uptake in China.","text",226
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","It has been estimated that 7% (by weight) of fish produced in China die during transport(71,75). This high mortality has been attributed to inappropriate transport procedures and monitoring.","text",227
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","There is a code of practice for the transport of live fish in China(78). This code outlines practices for packaging, the environmental conditions of the fish, food safety, and so on.","text",228
"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look","Although the evidence is scarce, these sources suggest that it could be common for fish to experience intense suffering during live transport in China.

This report is based on the strongest and most relevant available scientific studies, as identified by a global systematic literature review. From several thousand publications, including both peer-reviewed studies and grey literature, we identified 13 high-quality sources for estimating the costs of egg production; 10 for the costs of pigmeat production; and 4 for consumer prices.","text",11
"https://www.animalask.org/post/economic-evaluation-of-the-transition-to-cage-free-housing-on-the-eu-egg-and-pigmeat-industries","Overall, our conclusions demonstrate that the transition towards cage-free housing is likely to have a relatively small impact on producers and consumers, particularly if appropriate support is offered by official bodies in the EU and its Member States. Additionally, the experiences of other jurisdictions around the world provide evidence that an implementation timeline of around 3-5 years is reasonable.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","SUMMARY","text",11
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","Due to the desire to reduce animal welfare violations, CCTV cameras have been installed in slaughterhouses in a number of jurisdictions around the world. This has been driven by legal requirements (e.g. England, Israel), agreements between industry and government (e.g. the Netherlands), or retailer requirements (e.g. United States).","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","There have been no studies testing whether CCTV cameras actually deter violations of animal welfare regulations in slaughterhouses. Until a scientific study calculates the magnitude of the effect of CCTV on compliance with animal welfare regulations, it is difficult to be certain about the exact magnitude of CCTV's impact. However, anecdotal reports from slaughterhouse employees and government officers consistently indicate that CCTV cameras do deter animal welfare violations. This hypothesis is also supported by studies on the effect of CCTV on reducing crime in other contexts. Furthermore, animal welfare violations before and during slaughter risk causing suffering that is extreme.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","The slaughterhouse only represents a very small proportion of an animal's life. Even if CCTV cameras do deter animal welfare violations, under certain moral worldviews this may only result in a small welfare improvement when considered across an animal's entire lifespan. Additionally, CCTV can only reduce existing non-compliance which does not affect every animal.","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","In conclusion, we find that campaigning for CCTV in slaughterhouses is likely to do less good for animals than other campaign options, even if CCTV is likely to reduce non-compliance with animal welfare regulations.","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","BACKGROUND TO CCTV CAMERAS IN SLAUGHTERHOUSES","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","In many countries around the world, there are laws that aim to protect the welfare of farmed animals during slaughter. For any welfare regulation to improve the lives of animals in practice, appropriate monitoring and enforcement measures need to be put in place. To monitor the welfare of animals during slaughter, one policy that is often proposed is to install CCTV in slaughterhouses. Under this policy, it is hypothesised that CCTV can deter slaughterhouse owners and employees from violating animal welfare regulations.","text",17
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","There has been no scientific study on whether CCTV in slaughterhouses can deter animal welfare violations in practice. However, there have been many studies on CCTV and reducing crime in other contexts. Research on CCTV and crime in general is grounded in the rational choice perspective(1,2). This is a perspective that emphasises characteristics of the environment, rather than the individual, when an individual is evaluating whether or not to commit a crime. Here, 'rational' does not suggest that people who commit animal welfare violations are perfectly rational. Rather, the term means that potential offenders nevertheless evaluate the potential outcomes of committing a crime, no matter how rapid or bounded that evaluation may be. The rational choice perspective still applies to crimes committed in anger or other intense emotions.","text",18
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","The rational choice perspective describes potential offenders as making a decision based on the effort, risk of detection, potential rewards, provocations, and excuses associated with a crime opportunity(1). CCTV emphasises the ‘risk of detection’, particularly when the CCTV cameras are visible and obvious and/or when crimes are rapidly followed by a response by authorities. The other components in that list may provide insight into preventing animal welfare violations through other means (see final paragraph of report).","text",19

"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","Around the world, there are a handful of jurisdictions that have either placed CCTV cameras in slaughterhouses or have considered doing so.","text",21

"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","In the United Kingdom (UK), the welfare of farmed animals is under the jurisdiction of the devolved governments (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland). Each of these governments has a different policy on CCTV in slaughterhouses.","text",23
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","In England, the use of CCTV in slaughterhouses is mandated by law. This has been the case since 2018, when the Mandatory Use of Closed Circuit Television in Slaughterhouses (England) Regulations 2018 was established. It mandates that footage must be held for 90 days, and inspectors have 'unrestricted access to footage'(3). However, a report written before the regulations were established concluded that the review of footage is likely to be 'intermittent, selective and periodic', which may reduce the value of the footage for deterring animal welfare offences(4). In England, it is accepted that CCTV offers many benefits beyond animal welfare, such as security, training, workplace safety, and auditing and evaluation of facilities(4).","text",24
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","In Scotland, the use of CCTV in slaughterhouses is also mandated by law. This has been the case since 2021, when the Mandatory Use of Closed Circuit Television in Slaughterhouses (Scotland) Regulations 2020 was established. Similarly to the mandate in England, footage must be held for 90 days and can be accessed by inspectors(5).","text",25
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","In Wales, although it is not mandatory to use CCTV cameras in slaughterhouses, many slaughterhouses voluntarily use them. 90% of red meat animals and 97% of poultry animals are killed in slaughterhouses that use CCTV(6). The use of CCTV in slaughterhouses in Wales is required by some certification schemes and is encouraged through government grants(7).","text",26

Since the CCTV cameras are installed voluntarily rather than as a legal requirement, there are a few weaknesses with the systems. For example, inspectors can only access images during physical camera inspections and not remotely; the images remain the property of the slaughterhouses, and the slaughterhouse owners, not government officers, decide where to place the cameras(12).","text",36

Some employees lodged official complaints relating to data protection(13,14), although many slaughterhouses in Lower Saxony continue to use CCTV today(15).

"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","There have been no high-quality, empirical studies on whether CCTV cameras improve compliance with animal welfare laws in slaughterhouses. An analysis by the UK Government in 2011 using data on compliance rates found that CCTV cameras do not improve compliance(21). However, the specifics of this analysis are not explained in detail, and the analysis appears rudimentary. The governments of the UK and the Netherlands do publish data on slaughterhouse inspection and compliance rates, but this data is not in a format suitable for conducting an analysis on the effects of CCTV. A government representative from the Netherlands told us that a pilot study found that the probability of detection is ~75 times higher in slaughterhouses with CCTV, although there is no data on whether this translates to higher compliance with animal welfare regulations. However, since probability of detection is a significant factor in the rational choice perspective of crime deterrence, using CCTV is likely to translate to higher compliance.","text",46
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","When asked to give anecdotal evidence, slaughterhouse employees and government officials consistently claim that CCTV cameras do seem to improve compliance with animal welfare laws in slaughterhouses. Ten slaughterhouse employees in the US surveyed by Wigham all reported that CCTV improves animal welfare at slaughter, as long as CCTV footage is audited and staff are held accountable for their actions(18). Moreover, those employees reported that 'the number of misconducts had decreased since the start of CCTV auditing', and that when the quality assurance team member (who is responsible for auditing the footage) is away from the slaughterhouse, the number of non-compliances increases(18). Similar anecdotal evidence from the US is reported by Edwards-Callaway(22). We spoke with government officials from countries where CCTV has been mandatory or widespread, and it was consistently reported that CCTV appears to deter animal welfare violations in slaughterhouses.","text",47
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","The UK government is required, as part of the 2018 regulations that established mandatory CCTV in slaughterhouses, to publish a review of the CCTV mandate. This review is required to be published before 4 May 2023. That review must 'assess the extent to which [the] objectives are achieved'. Therefore, there is a good chance that this review will involve analysing data on whether CCTV does deter animal welfare violations in the UK.","text",48
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","In the jurisdictions that have installed CCTV, officials generally state that CCTV can augment existing inspection and compliance regimes but not replace those regimes(4,6,8).","text",49
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","As noted above, CCTV surveillance in slaughterhouses is believed to have the greatest deterrent effect when non-compliances are rapidly detected and addressed. However, constantly monitoring the footage produced by every camera in every slaughterhouse is not feasible, so most of the footage is not viewed. Increasingly, the monitoring of slaughterhouse footage is conducted using artificial intelligence (AI)¹. This was the motivation behind the AI4Animals (Artificial Intelligence for Animals) system, developed jointly for use in the Netherlands by animal welfare organisations, a meat company, and Deloitte. AI4Animals uses an algorithm to detect video segments that are likely to contain animal welfare violations and flags them for review by humans(24).","text",50

"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","When it comes to the effects of CCTV on crime in general, the strongest piece of evidence is the 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis by Piza et al(2). The meta-analysis included 76 studies conducted over 40 years and constitutes an update of previous meta-analyses. This study found that 'CCTV is associated with a significant and modest decrease in crime'.  However, the effects of CCTV depended on the setting, the type of monitoring, and the type of crime. The strongest evidence for the effects of CCTV were observed in car parks and residential areas, with weaker evidence found in other settings. The largest effect was observed when CCTV cameras were actively monitored and when there were multiple interventions alongside this. However, though CCTV was associated with reductions for vehicle crime and property crime, there were no significant effects for violent crime. Notably, significant effects for violent crime have been detected in individual studies due to particular details of how CCTV is implemented (e.g. rapid responses to violations, see below).","text",53
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","Another useful piece of evidence is the 2017 narrative review by Alexandrie(25). Alexandrie was concerned by threats to causal validity in the literature on CCTV. As such, their review selectively focused on randomised experiments and natural experiments, and it included seven studies overall. This review also concluded that CCTV reduces crime in some settings but not others. There were reductions in crime on public streets and at urban subway stations, but no evidence of crime reductions in consumer parking facilities or suburban subway stations.","text",54
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","One expert we spoke to pointed out that most studies on CCTV (including the meta-analysis)  focus on public settings. CCTV in private settings, such as retail stores, might be more relevant to CCTV in slaughterhouses. The strongest piece of evidence relating to CCTV in private settings is a 2011 randomised control trial by Hayes and Downs(1). This study tested the effect of two types of CCTV cameras (in-aisle CCTV public view monitors and in-aisle CCTV domes) on the rate of shoplifting of razor blades, a valuable, frequently shoplifted item. The results showed that both types of CCTV cameras caused a notable and statistically significant decrease in the rate of shoplifting. The authors suggest that this decrease occurred because the CCTV cameras increased the perceived risk of detection.","text",55
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","Another expert provided evidence that CCTV cameras would only serve as a deterrent if they are backed up by rapid responses to violations. The efficacy of any deterrent hinges on the certainty of punishment(26,27). (This matches the anecdotal experiences reported by US slaughterhouse employees, above.) In one randomised control trial in New Jersey, scientists tested whether rapid responses to violations observed on CCTV cameras could cause a decrease in the crime rate(27). This study involved CCTV schemes that had been implemented to address violent crime, social disorder, and narcotics activity. The study did find that rapid responses to violations caused the crime rate to decrease, although the effects were larger for violent crime and social disorder than for narcotics activity.","text",56
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","Overall, the general crime literature provides both empirical evidence that CCTV can prevent crime and a theoretical explanation for why it does. There is, notably, variation across studies; the strongest effects seem to be observed in CCTV interventions that are well-implemented, such as those that are accompanied by a rapid response. The theoretical explanation offered for CCTV's preventative effect (increasing the rate of perceived detection) is general, so we expect that this mechanism would also apply to the context of slaughterhouses. The crime experts we spoke to agree with this claim. As such, this body of literature offers evidence that well-designed CCTV interventions would indeed prevent animal welfare violations in slaughterhouses.","text",57

"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","The slaughterhouse only represents a very small proportion of an animal's life. The evidence outlined in this report does indicate that CCTV could improve animal welfare in the slaughterhouse, but even a moderate improvement in animal welfare - such as the improvement that would arise if CCTV deters animal welfare violations in the slaughterhouse - would represent only a small improvement in the welfare of an animal across their lifespan. Animal welfare improvements that instead apply for a longer period of an animal's lifespan, such as welfare reforms on the farm, may be more impactful than CCTV in slaughterhouses.","text",59
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","Admittedly, animal welfare violations before and during slaughter risk causing suffering that is extreme. Philosophical worldviews that focus heavily on preventing extreme suffering may therefore place a greater importance on deterring animal welfare violations using CCTV in slaughterhouses opposed to welfare reforms on the farm. However, when we are faced with decisions that pull us between different worldviews, an effective choice is one that looks robustly impactful under many philosophical worldviews. CCTV in slaughterhouses may look effective from the perspective of extreme suffering-focused worldviews, but not other worldviews. As such, campaigning for CCTV in slaughterhouses is less effective than other campaign options, including campaigns that improve welfare across animals' lifespans.","text",60
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","This raises the question of whether CCTV could be installed not just in slaughterhouses, but also on farms. However, we spoke to one expert who pointed out that advocating for CCTV cameras on farms may be more difficult. Farmers often live on, or have closer personal relationships with, their farms, so the proposal to install CCTV on farms may trigger more sensitive emotions within the farming industry. CCTV on farms would also result in a very high volume of data that may require either large teams or artificial intelligence to audit appropriately.","text",61

"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","Publishing images of cruelty from undercover investigations could be an indispensable strategy for building public and political support for CCTV in slaughterhouses. In all cases, proposals for CCTV in slaughterhouses gained political and public traction following the media publication of imagery showing animal cruelty obtained in independent investigations by animal advocacy organisations(11,28–31).","text",64
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","Encouraging some slaughterhouses to install CCTV cameras, perhaps through pressure from certification schemes or retailers, might make it easier to subsequently make CCTV a legal requirement across the industry. In England, CCTV cameras were only required by law after a large proportion of slaughterhouses had already installed them. The use of CCTV in slaughterhouses was required by most major food retailers and by RSPCA's Freedom Food certification scheme, and it was recommended by other certification schemes and associations(4). In 2010, around 7% of slaughterhouses had installed CCTV(4). This number increased gradually until 2016, when around 50% of red meat slaughterhouses and 70% of poultry slaughterhouses had adopted CCTV for animal welfare purposes(29). Requirements by certification schemes and retailers encouraged slaughterhouses, particularly those belonging to larger businesses, to adopt CCTV, which in turn may have reduced opposition to the subsequent legal regulations. In fact, when large producers voluntarily adopt new animal welfare practices, those large producers often lobby the government to make those practices legally binding to avoid other producers having an economic advantage(32).","text",65
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","There are also dangers that installing CCTV in slaughterhouses can rebound. Slaughterhouse owners in the Netherlands have argued that, given that CCTV cameras have been installed, companies that perform well on inspections should have fewer physical inspections(12). In contrast, stakeholders in the UK and the US maintain that CCTV cannot replace physical inspections(18,29). Separately, one expert we interviewed pointed out that slaughterhouse employees may commit deliberate acts of animal cruelty in the cameras' blind spots, and this did indeed occur in the Netherlands(33). This highlights the need to ensure that CCTV interventions are well-designed (discussed in 'CCTV and crime in general', above).","text",66
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","The experts we consulted spoke about the critical importance of open communication between the government and the industry. When implementing CCTV in slaughterhouses, it is essential for the government to communicate early and often with slaughterhouse owners to help address any concerns and overcome any challenges. It may also be beneficial to replicate the small grant scheme established by the government in Wales, which helped address complaints by smaller businesses that the costs of purchasing and maintaining CCTV systems would be prohibitive(6). The impact analysis conducted by the UK government could also help to address such complaints(34).","text",67
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","Lastly, it is important to ensure that CCTV cameras installed in slaughterhouses do not infringe upon the rights of employees in terms of data protection(13,14).","text",68
"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","Beyond CCTV, there are other ways that animal welfare violations in slaughterhouses may be reduced. Research has found that cruelty to farm animals can be associated with poor work environments or workers who are abused themselves(35,36). Under the rational choice perspective of crime (see above), increasing surveillance is one of several avenues by which crime may be prevented. Another is reducing provocation, which may involve reducing frustrations and stress, avoiding disputes, reducing emotional arousal, neutralising peer pressure, and/or discouraging imitation(1,37). Given the link between poor work environments and animal welfare violations, improving working conditions and workers' wellbeing may be an additional way to reduce animal welfare violations in slaughterhouses.","text",69

"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","When it comes to deterring violations of animal welfare regulations, one policy option is to install CCTV in slaughterhouses. Although there have been no direct academic studies on whether CCTV can deter welfare violations in slaughterhouses, anecdotal evidence and studies on CCTV’s effect on other types of crime do suggest that this policy may be effective in reducing non-compliance. However, the slaughterhouse only accounts for a small proportion of a farmed animal's lifespan. Unless one adopts a philosophical worldview that is focused on extreme suffering, we believe that this policy would be less impactful than welfare reforms that benefit animals throughout their lives.","text",71

"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare","1. Notably, the application of AI in animal agriculture presents many risks to the lives of animals - we are speculating here, but it may be the case that farmers, companies and/or governments that find value in applying AI to a particular area of farm operations may be more predisposed to applying AI to other areas of farm operations. This might contribute to the risk that AI makes animal agriculture more cost-effective and thus hinders the future success of the animal advocacy movement (23). This risk is worth flagging, but the scenario we outline is merely one possibility.","text",73

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","The welfare of farmed animals is a critical component of agriculture. Improving animal welfare means that animals live happier, healthier lives - not only is this good for its own sake, but animal welfare also supports community development, public health, and environmental outcomes. In this report, we identify the top opportunities for improving farmed animal welfare in Uganda.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","For civil society and other stakeholders who seek to improve the lives of animals, it is important to focus efforts on the species, campaigns, and policies that will bring about the biggest improvements for a given investment of effort. Campaigns should focus on reaching as many animals as possible. Fish (170 million individuals) and chickens (43 million individuals) are the most numerous farmed animals in Uganda by far, and intensively farmed fish and chickens typically experience poorer welfare conditions than other animals. So, improving the lives of farmed fish and chickens is a priority. Likewise, campaigns should focus on the strategies that achieve the largest benefits. We recommend focusing on government outreach, though this can be supplemented by farmer outreach for some campaigns.","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","With this in mind, we have identified four main priority asks. All of these asks are high-priority and would make highly impactful campaigns. The flowchart below can help guide your choice of campaign from these four major options. The four priority asks are:","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Preventing industrialised animal farming. Uganda currently has a mix of intensive, semi-intensive, and free range farming (more details below). Intensive and semi-intensive farming have been predicted to grow substantially as Uganda develops. This would cause many more animals to suffer, and it could cause animal welfare to deteriorate. This ask would involve advocating for the government to prevent the growth of intensive and semi-intensive farming, and to instead favour extensive and/or free-range farming. This ask would improve the lives of numerous animals in the short-term and in the long-term, and it would provide critical information for animal advocates in other developing countries. This ask would also allow Uganda to avoid many of the public health and environmental problems that have been caused by intensive farming in other countries.","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Umbrella animal welfare regulations. Many countries have legally binding regulations that improve animal welfare on farms and ban farming practices that cause animals extreme suffering. This ask would involve advocating for the government to establish a similar set of legally binding regulations in Uganda, possibly building on the draft standards that do exist in Uganda. This would improve the lives of numerous animals now, allow animal welfare standards to become stronger over time, and provide legitimacy for future animal welfare campaigns.","text",17
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Fish welfare improvements. Fish are the most numerous group of farmed animals in Uganda. Intensive, commercial-scale fish production is growing in Uganda, and this type of production typically causes fish to suffer throughout their lives. This ask would seek to improve the lives of farmed fish. Specifically, this ask could be achieved by: campaigning for the government to establish an overarching fish welfare standard; working with farmers to improve fish welfare on farms; and strengthening biosecurity and disease prevention policy.","text",18
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Chicken welfare improvements. Chicken are the second most numerous group of farmed animals in Uganda. Intensive, commercial-scale chicken production also causes chickens to suffer throughout their lives, and this type of production is expected to expand in Uganda. This ask would seek to improve the lives of farmed chickens. Specifically, this ask could be achieved by: campaigning for the government to establish an overarching chicken welfare standard; working with farmers to improve chicken welfare on farms; and working with investors or banks to direct investment to higher-welfare farms.","text",19
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Throughout our research, we have repeatedly found that there is scarce information about existing welfare conditions and agricultural policy. This means that we are facing more uncertainty than we typically do in our research. To overcome this uncertainty, we have identified four main priorities. All of these priorities appear to be very strong - even in the face of uncertainty, we would expect each of these priorities to be capable of improving the lives of millions of farmed animals.","text",20
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","These priorities can be selected and adapted based on on-the-ground conditions, which could include existing welfare conditions, the policy landscape, and stakeholder views. We have illustrated how an ask could be chosen based on the policy landscape and stakeholder views - see the below flowchart. If you are interested in advocating for farmed animal welfare in Uganda and none of these campaign opportunities are suitable for your circumstances, then we encourage you to reach out to Animal Ask so we can help you select the best campaign for you.","text",21

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Before we explain the priority asks in detail, it is important to keep in mind one of the most important factors in determining the impact of a campaign. This factor is the number of animals affected by the campaign. Institutional advocacy has one key advantage: it can reach across the entire country and can affect animals throughout Uganda. Taking advantage of this unique opportunity can magnify the impact of an animal advocacy campaign and improve the lives of animals and people at an enormous scale. To seize this opportunity, it is important to focus campaigns on the species of farmed animals with the highest numbers.","text",24
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Here, we list the number of farmed animalsalive at any one timein Uganda. This differs from the number of animals slaughtered each year (see below). These numbers are approximations and are based on our own calculations, using data from Uganda Bureau of Statistics, FAO, and Open Philanthropy(1–3). Keep in mind that the data sources we have used suffer from some inaccuracies, so this data should be taken as a rough approximation.","text",25
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","170 million fish. Around 55% of these are tilapia, and around 45% are catfish. Fish farms can be small-scale (smallholders) or medium- and large-scale (commercial)(4).","text",26
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","43 million chickens. Around 82% of these are farmed for meat, and around 18% for eggs. The majority of chickens are free-range (55%), though some chickens are farmed in semi-intensive (20%) or intensive (25%) systems(5).","text",27
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","17 million goats. Goats are generally farmed on individual or communal grazing land in small flocks of one or two dozen goats, though small-scale commercial farms are more common around Mubende District(6,7).","text",28
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","15 million cows. Around 75% of these are farmed for meat, and around 25% for milk. The vast majority of cows are pastoral or agro-pastoral (90%), with only a minority in semi-intensive (2%) or commercial ranching (8%)(5).","text",29
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","4.6 million sheep. Sheep are farmed in similar conditions to goats, although farmers usually only keep a few sheep(6,8).","text",30
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","4.4 million pigs. Most pigs are raised informally in free range or scavenging backyard systems, although pigs raised in urban settings are often farmed using intensive methods(9).","text",31
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","370,000 rabbits(10). Most rabbits are raised in small groups for local consumption(10).","text",32
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","There are also roughly 100 billion bees farmed for honey and beeswax(1,2,11). Lastly, there are some farmed prawns and crayfish, but there is no available data on numbers(4).","text",33
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Given these numbers,the strongest opportunity for animal advocacy organisations in Uganda is improving the welfare of farmed fish and chickens. For every goat in Uganda, there are ten fish and two-and-a-half chickens. Also, intensively farmed chickens and fish typically experience poorer welfare conditions than other groups of farmed animals(12,13). Influencing government policy to improve fish and chickens represents an opportunity to do an immense amount of good for both animals and communities.","text",34
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","For comparison, we also present the number of animalsslaughtered per year. These numbers are given in Table 1. This is another useful metric to consider, and it is relevant for some ethical views. For example, some views place a great emphasis on preventing extreme suffering, such as the suffering experienced by animals at slaughter. For this reason, it is useful to consider both the number of animals alive at any one time and the number of animals slaughtered per year. When considering the number of animals slaughtered per year, fish and chickens appear to be an even greater priority - this is because fish and chickens have shorter lifespans than other animals. This provides even more reason to focus animal advocacy efforts in Uganda on fish and chickens.","text",35
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Improving the welfare of goats and cows - and to a lesser extent, sheep and pigs - would still be good if an organisation is unwilling or unable to work on fish or chicken welfare. Improving the welfare of farmed bees would also be beneficial, but not all organisations would be willing to work on this and there are fewer well-tested interventions for improving bee welfare(14). Overall, fish and chickens should take precedent in welfare campaigns, given the enormous scale of those two groups of animals and the comparatively worse conditions that they typically experience.","text",36

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Note that there are known inaccuracies in these sources from which this data was obtained(15,16). For example, this data would imply that pigs are kept for about two years, but in reality they are kept for about six months(17). Likewise, this data would imply that cows are kept for about ten years, but in reality most cows seem to be slaughtered by age 5(18). This data should be taken as a rough approximation, not a perfect data source. Nevertheless, the main conclusion we draw from this data - that fish and chickens are the most numerous farmed vertebrates in Uganda by far - is basically certain to remain true.","text",39

These four opportunities are listed in order of priority. However, the campaign that you choose from these should be guided by the local, on-the-ground conditions (e.g. receptiveness of policymakers to particular asks).

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Table 2. Summary of our top recommended campaign opportunities for animal advocacy in Uganda.","text",44
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Priority 1: Preventing industrialised animal farming","text",45
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","The highest priority is to advocate against the growth of industrialised animal farming in Uganda. This campaign could have the largest benefit of any opportunity that we identified. This campaign would aim to stop or slow the growth of industrialised farming, and instead favour extensive or free-range farming.","text",46
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","By industrialised animal farming, we mean the system of commercial animal farming that involves large-scale, indoor facilities, where animals are 'confined indoors under strictly controlled conditions'(19). Industrialised animal farming uses intensive production methods like battery cages and gestation crates, and this system is generally designed to maximise profits and minimise costs(19). The specifics of the policy would determine which exact practices are banned or prevented. In contrast, extensive animal farming involves natural environments, where animals can express natural behaviours, such as exploration, grazing, and exercise(20). The pastoral and free-range systems that are used by small-scale households in Uganda are examples of extensive production systems.","text",47
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","The population of Uganda is expected to at least double over the next 40 years(21). While many Ugandans will still experience poverty, the average amount of wealth per person will increase(21). A higher percentage of the population will reside in urban areas. A larger, wealthier Ugandan population is likely to demand more meat. So, it is possible that the government will seek to grow the industrialised farming sector to address this growing demand for meat. On the other hand, the government could be encouraged to support extensive or free-range production.","text",48
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","There are many ways to encourage the government to support extensive production rather than industrial/intensive production. This could help the government avoid the public health and environmental problems that have been caused by industrialised animal farming in developed countries (see Appendix 2: Animal Welfare and One Health). Specifically, supporting extensive and free-range production would enable agricultural income to be dispersed to many households, particularly those experiencing poverty, rather than to a handful of large, commercial companies. Likewise, this could enable the government to position themselves as a leader in sustainable agricultural policy on both the regional and global stage, especially considering the attention being given to animal welfare at the level of the African Union(22,23).","text",49
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","The benefits from preventing the growth of industrialised animal farming in Uganda would fall into three categories. Firstly, farmed animals would likely experience conditions that are better for their welfare. Intensive animal farming involves confining animals in large, densely populated buildings. This usually stops animals from experiencing freedoms and natural behaviours that are essential for their welfare, and there are many specific harms involved with industrial production systems (e.g. painful mutilations or health problems caused by using fast-growing breeds)(24,25). Indeed, the major animal welfare campaigns currently taking place in developed countries focus on phasing out the worst practices of industrialised farming, like keeping hens in cages(26). If Uganda did not pursue intensive animal farming, and instead favoured extensive or free-range farming, then the conditions that cause immense suffering to animals would be averted.","text",50
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Secondly, this campaign in Uganda would be extremely valuable as a source of information for animal advocates in other developing countries. If this campaign is successful in Uganda, then it would be a watershed moment - the campaign could be replicated in other countries around the world, magnifying its impact substantially and improving the lives of hundreds of millions or even billions of animals worldwide.","text",51
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Thirdly, there may be fewer animals farmed overall. Industrialised farming systems were developed to farm a very large number of animals very cheaply. Extensive or free-range farming would produce a smaller number of animals, which could mean that fewer animals are born into lives of suffering. This would depend on whether Ugandans' demand for meat remains relatively low, or whether the demand increases but is met by free-range production or even imports from other countries.","text",52
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","The scale of this ask could be immense. At any one time, there are 170 million farmed fish in Uganda - most of these fish are farmed intensively, and projections show that fish production across Africa is likely to grow by between two and six times over the next 30 years¹(27). Likewise, there are 43 million chickens being farmed in Uganda, almost half of which are farmed in semi-intensive or intensive systems(5). The FAO predicts that there could be up to 187 million chickens farmed for meat by 2050, compared to 37 million today (not including layer hens), with up to 90% in semi-intensive or intensive production (compared to 45% today)(5). This ask could slow this growth drastically, meaning that fewer animals are born into lives of suffering and the animals that are farmed do not experience the suffering typical of intensive production systems.","text",53
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","The key question is whether it is possible to prevent the growth of industrialised animal farming in Uganda - or, indeed, in any country. At the global level, there is currently some research underway (by both Animal Advocacy Africa and Animal Ask) that aims to shine further light on this question. However, the most critical uncertainty is whether a government and other stakeholders would be willing to consider the possibility of stopping industrialised farming. Conducting this campaign could not only improve the lives of over seven hundred million animals alive at any one time by 2050 (though this depends on the specifics of the policy), but could also unlock the opportunity for animal advocates around the world to replicate this campaign.","text",54

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","The next highest priority is to advocate for umbrella animal welfare regulations. This would involve establishing a collection of standards that govern animal welfare for, at least, intensive and semi-intensive production. These standards would be most impactful if they include both fish and chickens, and including other groups of farmed animals would be a bonus.","text",57
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","The impact of this ask hinges on the strength of the resulting regulations. Ideally, the regulations would be legally binding, and they would cover the major groups of farmed animals, like fish and chickens. The ideal regulations would also establish regular reviews - this would set up an institutional framework through which animal welfare standards in Uganda can be improved over time. Strong, overarching regulations like these would improve the lives of animals now and in the future, and these regulations would also provide legitimacy for future animal welfare campaigns.","text",58
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","The ideal regulations would cover the major welfare problems experienced by farmed animals. Studying the major welfare problems would require the knowledge of local experts and other stakeholders, as well as on-the-ground farm visits and species-specific considerations. However, generally speaking, chickens are likely to experience welfare problems in: breed, stocking density, litter and air quality, temperature, light and other equipment, nutrition, handling, transport, and stunning and slaughter(28). For fish, the major welfare problems generally include: water quality, space requirements and stocking density, feed composition, stunning and slaughter, and environmental enrichment(29). Similar lists can be produced for goats, cows, sheep, and pigs. A comprehensive welfare standard would cover all of these areas. (Fish and chickens are discussed further in their dedicated sections below.)","text",59
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Uganda has a draft set of animal welfare standards that cover animals farmed for food, published in 2019 (US ISO/TS 34700:2016 Animal welfare management General requirements and guidance for organizations in the food supply chain)². These standards are based on theTerrestrial Animal Health Codeof the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH / OIE). As it stands, this code provides very few practical protections for the species included. Chickens, for example, are afforded broad protection during transport, rearing and slaughter, but in most instances the code fails to specify any requirements. Instead, the code simply outlines factors that should be considered to improve their welfare. This may act as a first step towards practical protections, but as the code stands currently, the vast majority of requirements are unenforceable. Therefore, this code should be seen as largely symbolic. The Ugandan standards and the Terrestrial Animal Health Code exclude fish.","text",60
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Also, these standards are voluntary only - a first step could be to campaign for the Ugandan government to make these standards legally binding on commercial producers.","text",61
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","It would be ideal to include fish in any animal welfare regulations, as this would help improve the lives of the most numerous group of farmed animals in Uganda. The WOAH does produce anAquatic Animal Health Code, which covers the health and welfare of farmed fish. These standards mostly cover disease control, transport, stunning, and killing - as such, these standards do not cover other major determinants of fish welfare, like water quality and stocking density. Nevertheless, since this code is produced by the WOAH, as is the Terrestrial Animal Health Code on which Uganda's voluntary animal welfare standards are based, the government may be open to establishing a set of fish welfare standards based on the Aquatic Animal Health Code.","text",62
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","There are other, stronger fish welfare standards around the world that could be the basis for a new set of fish standards for Uganda. It may be useful to keep this in mind during discussions and negotiations with policymakers. A broad overview of fish welfare standards is available onthe website of the Aquatic Life Institute. For example, the certifier Aquaculture Stewardship Council is scheduled to release a new, strong set of fish welfare standards in late 2023, which will likely include welfare standards for Nile tilapia(30). African catfish is less common in certification schemes - the certifier GLOBALG.A.P. does have certification standards for this species(31), though animal welfare is not a strong focus.","text",63
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","It may be more tractable to begin with a smaller ask. It could be possible to campaign to place greater emphasis on animal welfare in an authoritative document, like the National Fisheries and Aquaculture Policy, the Agriculture Sector Strategic Plan, the One Health plan, or another government policy document. For example, this campaign could seek to commit the government to establishing new animal welfare policies in the future. While this campaign may be easier to achieve than strong regulations, it carries the risk of never actually resulting in any new meaningful policies.","text",64

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","There are three main systems of production for fish farming in Uganda(4). The most significant is the cage system. Cage farming, which has emerged recently and grown rapidly, involves intensive farming fish at high-densities inside cages in Uganda's lakes(4,16). Almost all Nile tilapia in Uganda are farmed in cages. The second system is pond farming, which involves intensive and semi-intensive farming for both Nile tilapia and African catfish(4). Thirdly, there are also tank systems, but these are mostly used for breeding and spawning(4).","text",69
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Fish farming is carried out by both commercial-scale farmers and smallholders(4). Commercial fish farming has been growing exponentially in recent years, due to commercial farmers' ability to access international finance and imported feed(16). This growth is expected to slow down slightly, but still remain relatively high. There is a list of the largest companies involved in aquaculture in Uganda, including farming companies, breeding companies, and feed producers, in the report by Larive International & Asigma Capital Advisory Services(16).","text",70
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Concrete evidence about the welfare of farmed fish in Uganda is sparse. Stocking densities in cages can reach 300 to 600 fish/m3. One study found that reducing these stocking densities can improve growth and survival of farmed tilapia(32), which may indicate that fish farmed at higher stocking densities are experiencing poor welfare.","text",71
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Unlike with other types of animals farmed in Uganda, most farmed fish are exported to nearby countries, like Kenya and the Democratic Republic of the Congo(16). About two-thirds of tilapia are exported, and about one-quarter of catfish are exported(16). This suggests that having links with stakeholders in those countries (e.g. retailers, civil society) could help lobbying efforts to improve fish welfare in Uganda.","text",72
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Advocacy efforts should focus on improving the lives of fish in large-scale, commercial production, rather than production by smallholders.

For each farm influenced, whether by direct help or policy change, many more fish would benefit.","text",73
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","The biggest uncertainty is whether advocating for farmed fish in Uganda is currently tractable. Fish are highly neglected by animal advocacy organisations in Africa, almost all of which focus on land animals(33). This would suggest that advocating for farmed fish may have a particularly large impact - there may be some policies that could improve fish welfare for relatively little effort, simply because fish welfare has not received attention in Uganda. Likewise, the first organisation to conduct work on fish welfare in Uganda could inspire other organisations, policymakers, and farmers to give this issue greater attention, thereby increasing the impact of a campaign even more. However, there is basically no precedent for work on farmed fish welfare in Uganda, which might make a fish welfare campaign less likely to succeed. As we have illustrated in the flow chart at the beginning of this report, the key question is whether policymakers, fish farmers, and other stakeholders would consider taking measures to improve fish welfare. This is not a question we can resolve through our own research. So, if you are looking to carry out an animal advocacy campaign in Uganda, a wise first step would be to conduct some initial scoping research to answer this question (and the others in the flow chart at the beginning of this report). This could involve speaking with policymakers and fish farmers to develop a sense of whether these people are willing to consider policies that improve fish welfare.","text",74

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","We have identified three main opportunities for improving fish welfare in Uganda. We focus on the campaigns for which there is sufficient evidence, based on our research. These three main opportunities that we have identified are:","text",76
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Establishing an overarching regulation for farmed fish welfare. This is discussed in detail above, and many of those strategies also apply here - this campaign would simply narrow the focus to fish, rather than including other animals. This campaign would involve identifying the major welfare problems experienced by farmed fish in Uganda, then campaigning for the government to implement an overarching regulation or other policy to address these welfare problems. A regulation would involve a collection of welfare considerations, perhaps covering water quality, space requirements and stocking density, feed composition, stunning and slaughter, and environmental enrichment(29). A broad regulation like this would enable the campaign to improve the lives of fish, even if the evidence is murky for any one welfare consideration.","text",77
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Assisting farmers with farmed fish welfare. In principle, this is similar to an overarching regulation for farmed fish welfare, except with a stronger emphasis on direct work with farmers rather than government lobbying. For example, this campaign could involve building relationships with farmers and then working with those farmers to improve fish welfare standards on farms. Improving fish health and welfare would improve growth and survival and reduce problems like disease and stunted growth(32,34), which could encourage farmers to participate in this programme. Work very similar to this is being conducted byFish Welfare Initiativein India and the Philippines, which could provide useful lessons to help begin this work in Uganda. This campaign could also build support for fish welfare among farmers, which could lay the groundwork for future policy lobbying campaigns.","text",78
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Improving fish biosecurity policy. Preventing and controlling diseases can prevent both unnecessary suffering in fish and financial losses to farmers. Uganda's policies for fish biosecurity do not include sufficient provisions for disease control and management(4). There are significant biosecurity lapses in regulatory frameworks and in practices on fish farm(4,16). As commercial-scale aquaculture expands, mass mortalities are becoming more common(4). This campaign would involve strengthening the regulatory frameworks for fish biosecurity and disease control and providing farmers with the knowledge and tools necessary to improve on-farm practices.","text",79

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","After fish, the group of animals with the next highest priority in Uganda are chickens. At any one time, there are 43 million chickens being farmed in Uganda. These are mostly broiler chickens (82%), although there is a notable population of layer hens (18%). Currently, just under half of all chickens are farmed in semi-intensive (20%) or intensive (25%) systems(5). Intensive production involves farming thousands of chickens at a time, usually exotic breeds. Intensive production generally takes place in large, permanent buildings in peri-urban areas(5). Semi-intensive is similar, though building structures may be more basic, and chickens may scavenge for food. Just over half of chickens are farmed in free-range systems (55%)(5). Free-range systems involve small flocks of a few indigenous chickens, who are kept by a household and freely scavenge for food(5).","text",83
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Advocacy efforts should focus on improving the lives of chickens in intensive and semi-intensive production, rather than free-range production. Since the flocks are much larger in intensive and semi-intensive production, it is possible to reach a much higher number of chickens with advocacy efforts than would be possible for free-range production. It is also likely that, like in other countries, chickens farmed intensively or semi-intensively live worse lives than free-range chickens(28,35). For each farm influenced, whether by direct help or policy change, thousands of chickens would benefit, rather than just a few.","text",84
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","The FAO predicts that there could be a massive expansion of semi-intensive and intensive poultry production over the next 30 years. This expansion would mean that there are many more chickens farmed in Uganda, with up to 187 million chickens farmed for meat by 2050, compared to 37 million today (not including layer hens). This rate of growth is similar to the growth expected for farmed fish (see above). This expansion would also mean that a higher percentage of chickens in Uganda are farmed under industrial conditions, with up to 90% in semi-intensive or intensive production (compared to 45% today)(5).","text",85

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Establishing an overarching regulation for broiler chicken welfare.As with the similar fish campaign (above), this campaign would focus on establishing overarching regulations for broiler chickens. This campaign could also progress to including layer hen regulations as well. For broilers, the main welfare improvements to be included in the regulation can be determined by visiting some intensive farms and documenting the main welfare problems present, as well as drawing from experts in poultry welfare and existing regulations in other countries. However, the top welfare improvements are likely to include choice of breed (avoiding fast-growing breeds), stocking density, litter quality, environmental enrichment, and stunning and slaughter. Other factors that could also be improved include air quality, lighting, and outdoor access. For layer hens, regulations would likely focus on banning cages, reducing stocking density, providing environmental enrichment, and improving feed quality. Layer hen regulations could also include a ban on male chick culling, instead requiring producers to use pre-hatch sexing as is being implemented in several European countries. To improve the prioritisation of these different factors, it would be useful to visit some intensive farms and document the main welfare problems present. This would also provide valuable local data to present to the government to assist with advocacy efforts.","text",90

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Assisting farmers with broiler welfare.Another option is to work directly with farmers. This campaign would be most effective if it focuses on the largest farms -  particularly those transitioning to, or expanding, intensive production - rather than smallholders with only a few chickens. This work would encourage farmers to implement some of the specific welfare improvements (listed in the dot point above) by pointing out how these improvements can also benefit broiler health and productivity. (Some improvements, like slower-growing breeds, would not benefit productivity.) Working with farmers would build support for higher-welfare farming systems and would therefore be a useful tactic towards achieving broader regulations.","text",92
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Ensure industrialisation is focused on higher-welfare systems.This intervention would require close coordination with large-scale investors and banks to influence the development and intensification of the broiler industry. One type of this campaign involves working with shareholders - 'shareholder activism' is discussed in detail inthis article, and it seems like a promising approach for advocacy. The aim would be to direct investment or require that investments are only made to farms that plan to adopt higher welfare practices, such as those outlined above. The poultry sector in Uganda appears to be constrained by insufficient capital investment(36). This suggests that attaching welfare conditions to investments and loans would indeed encourage farmers to follow those welfare conditions. If successful, this could influence the development of the poultry sector in a direction that involves higher animal welfare from the beginning. This could also make future calls for welfare regulations more likely to be successful. For this campaign, it is important not to accidentally encourage any additional capital investment or loans in the poultry sector, as this could inadvertently cause poultry farming to expand; rather, the campaign should focus on attaching welfare conditions to investments and loans that would have been made anyway.","text",93

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Above, we have provided the highest-priority asks for improving the welfare of farmed animals in Uganda. However, for each of these asks, there may be a few different campaign methods. Animal advocacy organisations have many different types of campaigns available to them. Organisations can maximise their chances of success by selecting a type of campaign that is well-suited to the context of animal welfare in Uganda.","text",95
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Government outreachis the type of campaign that we think is strongest for Uganda. Government outreach involves working with policymakers, such as Ministry employees and politicians, to adopt new animal welfare policies and reform existing policies. This type of campaign is cost-effective, as it is possible to establish impactful policies with a relatively small team. There are relatively few animal advocacy organisations working on government outreach in Uganda and even in Africa(37). The talent necessary for this type of campaign is relatively easy to find.","text",96
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Government outreach does risk having no impact or even causing overall harm(37). For example, in Uganda, delays due to bureaucracy can mean that a campaign stalls and has no impact. Likewise, a poorly designed campaign could do more harm than good.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Beyond our top recommendation, there are three other types of campaigns that we encourage organisations to consider:","text",98
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Public/individual outreachinvolves creating awareness among the public or certain groups (e.g. farmers) about topics like animal welfare, animal sentience, and vegan diets. This type of campaign is highly scalable, and the necessary talent is available(37). Public/individual outreach can build support for animal advocacy in Africa, possibly making institutional campaigns (like government outreach) easier in the future. This campaign type might risk causing negative reactions among the public(37), though we do not think that this risk is high.","text",99
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Direct helpinvolves providing direct, on-the-ground assistance to animals themselves, such as by conducting vaccination programmes or installing stunning equipment in slaughterhouses. Direct help is generally weaker across multiple measures, though it does have a lower risk of causing no or negative impact(37).","text",100
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Capacity buildinginvolves building the skills, abilities, and resources of farmers, veterinarians, and other community members to better understand and support animal welfare. Capacity building is generally weaker across multiple measures, and it is particularly difficult to measure its success(37). For Uganda specifically, research by the Animal Welfare Competence Centre for Africa found that there has been a programme aiming to build animal welfare capacity among veterinary inspectors and veterinary officers. This programme, led by Bam Animal Clinics, has reached more than 200 professionals, but the overall impact on animal welfare has been limited. This suggests that capacity building campaigns targeting veterinarians in Uganda would need to first require an understanding of why previous campaigns have been unsuccessful. Campaigns targeting other community members, like farmers, could still be promising.","text",101

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Producer pressure campaignsinvolve pressuring farmers, producers, and others involved in animal farming to commit to adopting higher welfare standards. However, this type of campaign depends on leveraging public opinion to place pressure on large-scale, industrial producers and farmers. Public support for animal welfare campaigns is a little lower in African countries than in the developed countries where producer pressure campaigns have been successful(38). For this reason, producer pressure campaigns are unlikely to work well in Uganda.","text",103
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Retailer/food service outreachinvolves campaigning for retailers (e.g. markets) and food service providers (e.g. restaurants and hotels) to only sell food produced to high welfare standards. This type of campaign has been successful in developed countries(39). However, this campaign depends on a relatively concentrated retail sector, with a small number of companies each controlling large volumes of trade. As such, this type of campaign is poorly suited to Uganda, where most farmed animals are either consumed by the family that raised them or sold locally on informal markets(5). As an exception, many farmed fish (particularly those farmed in large-scale, commercial operations) are exported to neighbouring countries like Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, and South Sudan(4,16). It could be possible to campaign for retailers in those countries to adopt higher welfare standards for these farmed fish, though the advocacy work necessary for this campaign would need to take place in those countries, rather than in Uganda. This campaign would be more likely to succeed if any of those countries had concentrated retail sectors, ideally with a few large retailers in tight competition with each other, as this dynamic encourages retailers to adopt animal welfare standards for their products.","text",104
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Certifier campaignis similar to retailer/food service outreach, except that companies are asked to adopt welfare certification schemes.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Increasing food safety. When animals harbour harmful bacteria likeSalmonellaandCampylobacter, people who eat the animals' meat can become sick. Healthier, less stressed animals are less likely to harbour these bacteria. This improves food safety and people's health(40,42,44).","text",116
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Reducing environmental problems. Better husbandry systems are more productive. This means that fewer resources like feed and water are wasted and that fewer environmental pollutants are released into the atmosphere and the water. This reduces environmental problems(42).","text",117
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","For economic development, animal welfare can also contribute to increasing farmer and community wealth and building the private sector. The government of Uganda seeks to transform the country into a modern and prosperous society at the upper-middle income level by 2040(45). Animal welfare can contribute to this goal:","text",118
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","More efficient food production. Animals with higher welfare are healthier and less stressed, and therefore experience lower mortality and higher yields(40). This makes agricultural production more efficient, helping both households and businesses to produce more.","text",119

Businesses that can produce food more efficiently will be in a strong economic position to develop, such as through capital investments. This can support Uganda's commitment to private sector development(45).","text",120
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","Improving food security. Helping households to produce food more efficiently can improve household food security(42), and preventing the emergence of zoonotic diseases can improve food security country-wide(44).","text",121

"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","1. Farming of goats, cows, pigs, and sheep may also expand and/or become more intensive, though these animals would still only represent a small percentage of intensive animal farming in Uganda.","text",125
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","2. The standard is available for purchase from the Uganda National Bureau of Standards, though we have been unable to obtain a copy.","text",126
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","3. The number of farmed fish may be smaller than our estimate, as one source concluded that the scale of production might actually be smaller than estimates would suggest (16). The number of farmed fish in Uganda would still be larger than the number of farmed chickens.","text",127
"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda","4. There is also a chance that building support for fish welfare could eventually inspire efforts to improve the welfare of wild-caught fish during capture, though scientific wild-caught fish welfare is less well-developed than farmed fish welfare.","text",128

"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Within animal advocacy, corporate campaigns have become an important and widely used tactic as evidence of their efficacy has accrued(Šimčikas 2019; Philanthropy 2016; Sarek 2019a, [b] 2019). These campaigns allow the movement to leverage a relatively small amount of funding to disrupt and apply large amounts of pressure onto corporations with the intention to achieve policy change. The asks for theseanti-corporatecampaigns can come in several forms; from more simplistic singular asks such as the cage-free campaigns, to more complicated composite asks which include several elements such as the Better Chicken Commitment(“The Better Chicken Commitment Policy” n.d.). From our previous research into the asks used in such corporate campaigns, we identified a foundational uncertainty in their construction. Namely, how much should we ask for? The more additional elements incorporated into the ask, the greater the potential benefits to the animal we are trying to provide improved protections. However, as more elements are added, the greater the investment required by the companies targeted, and the more difficult it becomes to communicate the ask to the public and the companies’ decision makers.","text",11
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","In this report, we examine the fundamental theories behind how these campaigns work and the factors determining their success. Ultimately we view corporate campaigns as a form of extortion, where interest groups threaten companies with either supply chain disruption, or more commonly, reputational damage if they do not comply with their demands. We find that if companies experience anti-corporate campaigns or suffer from other similar revelations of unethical business practices, this information can have significant lasting damage to their market capitalisation and financial performance. Thus, companies should be willing to invest significant resources to mitigate this risk. It is possible to model this decision from a rational economic point of view where corporations should be willing to pay up to the potential damage to avoid a campaign. However any attempts to do so should be understood within the specific context of thatcorporation'sdecision-makingand in light of the large amount of uncertainty involved. As corporate campaigns are ultimately a social phenomena, precise quantitative estimates are not reliable, but various research methods can be used to make more informed decisions on the magnitude of the ask that can be made. To better inform future decision makers in ask formation, we should combine this sort of analysis with scoping the specific context of the campaign including the supply chain, key stakeholders and their motivations.","text",12

"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Corporate campaigns are a strategic effort by an interest group to put pressure on or cooperate with a company to improve their organisation's policies. These interest groups can come from within the company, as is the case with labour unions, or external movements that focus on issues that fall outside the attention of the majority of employees or investors(King 2016). These types of campaigns have been used successfully in many different fields, including the ‘birth of the corporate campaign’ in workers unions(“ACTWU vs. J.P Stevens: 1976-1980” n.d.), fair trade(Harris 2021)and environmental protection(“Alaska Wilderness League vs. The Bush Administration: 2001-2002” n.d.).","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","These campaigns use a variety of tactics; from more cooperative approaches such as promoting change from within the company by supporting aligned stakeholders or offering technical assistance, to adversarial approaches such as media campaigns(Capriati 2018)or, in the case of labour unions, strikes. When cooperative approaches are used, this is better viewed as corporate outreach, although this is often the first stage of such campaigns when working with the most aligned companies within an industry. Whenever adversarial approaches are threatened, corporate campaigns can be viewed as a form of extortion where an interest group threatens a company with some action if they don’t capitulate to their demands.","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Theories for explaining the success of these movements depend on the tactics employed by the interest groups. The most simplistic tactic is economic disruption caused by direct action. When this is used, the aim of campaign groups is to directly disrupt the operations of the business, in order to impose large enough costs so they regard the costs of resistance as outweighing the costs of conceding to the group demands(Luders 2006; Spar and La Mure 2003). These tactics are most commonly used by primary stakeholders, such as labour unions who can use strikes or work to rule tactics to disrupt business. However, other movements have and continue to use direct action in a similar vein by blocking or disrupting supply chains through sit-ins or lock-ons.","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Many movements are able to achieve change through corporate campaigns without the use of mass disruption tactics(King 2016). Such campaigns typically target public facing companies that have increasingly emphasised the value of intangible resources, such as their reputation. Over the past few decades, firms have increased the monitoring and value of their reputations and caused reputation management to become a major focus of corporate public relations(King 2016). Thus, in as far as reputation is or is perceived to be connected with profit or market value, or valued intrinsically by management(Tim Bartley and Child 2007), interest groups can ‘name and shame’ corporations without disrupting the day-to-day business and still achieve their goals.","text",17

"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Why is reputation valuable to a firm?","text",19
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","As many modern anti-corporate campaigns have shifted towards targeting a firm’s reputation, understanding the value of their reputation is important for understanding the degree to which this can motivate a firm.","text",20
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Compared to the financial fundamentals of a firm's value, it is easy to see reputation as a nebulous and intangible asset beyond the scope of analysts’ models. However, it is widely observed that the valuation and performance of companies is only in part driven by easily measurable financial information, particularly in the short term, with the difference often being attributed to market ‘sentiment’(Cole 2012).","text",21
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Some efforts to measure a firm's reputation focus on one overall judgement of a company either across all groups or within groups of stakeholders. Other conceptions of a firm's reputation split reputation into two components; cognitive and affective(Raithel and Schwaiger 2015). The cognitive component encompasses judgements surrounding the firm’s competence and reliability, while the affective component captures ‘feelings’ towards a firm, such as emotional appeal, attractiveness, or social and environmental responsibility.","text",22
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Positive reputations have a number of potential favourable consequences, including the ability to charge higher prices, attract better applicants, and improve access to capital(Fombrun and Shanley 1990; Raithel and Schwaiger 2015; Srivastava et al. 1997). These ultimately influence the company's revenues, margins, and the existence of a competitive advantage(Smith, Smith, and Wang 2010). Corporate reputation has been found to create positive abnormal stock returns in the long term, particularly for non-financial aspects which are less likely to be priced in(Raithel and Schwaiger 2015), as well as providing a protective effect against crises(Schnietz and Epstein 2005; Wei, Ouyang, and Chen 2017).","text",23
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","What is the market value of a firm's reputation?","text",24
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Various researchers have attempted to develop methods to quantify the relative proportion of a company's market cap that is attributable to their reputation. Thus far, this has been motivated to create better predictive models of a company's value for investors, and to provide more objective measures for reputation management within firms. However, it should be possible to leverage the same information in corporate campaigns to actively work against the value of a company's reputation; both by targeting companies with valuations that are more dependent on their reputation, and if interest groups actively target the same measures that companies use when managing their public relations.","text",25
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Cole (2012), of Reputation Dividend, developed one such model by using regression analysis on a wide set of potential explanatory variables for a company’s market capitalisation, coveringfinancial informationand analytics alongside survey data from the ‘Most Admired Companies’ studies published by Management Today in the UK and Fortune in the US(Cole 2012). This survey measures reputation through the ratings of companies on nine criteria, from investment value and quality of management and products to social responsibility and ability to attract talent by a large sample of executives, directors, and securities analysts(Belanger 2022). The average of these was considered the overall strength of a company's reputation for Cole’s model. This information was run through multiple iterations and refinements. Cole’s model suggests that company reputations accounted for close to 26% and 32% of the total market capitalisation of the S&P 500 and FTSE 250 respectively. The variation in reputation contribution is even higher between individual companies, with a high of almost 58% (Apple) to a low of –39% (Sears Holdings). Reputation Dividend provides these evaluations each year in both the US and UK.","text",26

"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Other efforts to evaluate the value of a corporate reputation have taken a more direct route by surveying global executives for their direct estimates of this figure(Shandwick 2020). As with Cole’s (2012) estimate, Shandwick’s (2020) varied widely depending on the country. The average estimate was 63% of a firm's market value, but this was as low as 47% in the UK and Hong Kong, and as high as 76% in Brazil. On an individual firm level, abouttwo-thirdsof executives attributed over half their company’s value to their reputation and a third overthree-quartersof its value. These figures are much higher than the estimates produced by reputation analysis, suggesting that executives might overvalue their company’s reputation. However the definition of reputation used here wasbroaderthan Cole’s, with many executives including the quality of products and services as the main contributor to a company's reputation, which is likely to have a significant effect on its market value.","text",28
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Still, even if a firm's reputation makes up a large portion of a company's value, this does not reveal a company's willingness to pay to improve its reputation or avoid the cost involved in an anti-corporate campaign. Each of these variables will only be able to influence stakeholder perceptions to a degree.","text",29

"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","In principle, it should be possible to quantify more precisely the costs that NGO activism imposes on particular firms or industries(Spar and La Mure 2003). Does the share price of targeted firms decrease during campaigns and increase after commitments? Or can we measure the hypothesised effect of such campaigns on other outcomes, such as expense on the cost of recovery, lost revenue, talent acquisition, and the cost of capital for firms?","text",31
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","The existing evidence shows that public announcements or media attention towards poor labour practices(Rock 2003; T. Bartley and Child 2011), pollution(Hamilton 1995; Rao 1996; Rao and Brooke Hamilton 1996), sexual harassment(Bouzzine and Lueg 2022; Borelli-Kjaer, Schack, and Nielsson 2021)and employee discrimination(Rao and Brooke Hamilton 1996)can have a significant effect on the stock price of affiliated organisations. However, there are conflicting results, with some studies not finding significant effects(Tim Bartley and Child 2010)depending on the events included and time period analysed. Still, most published studies find that these effects can be quite large, with statistically significantshort-termeffects from the studies cited above ranging from -0.82%(Rock 2003)to -5.67%(Rao 1996).","text",32
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","In some instances, these effects can persist across larger time scales, with Rao finding strong abnormal effects six months after reports of a company's environmental pollution(Rao 1996). Pentland Analytics’ review of 125 of the largest crises between 2008 and 2018 found that companies lost 5% of expected market capitalisation in the following 12 months(Pretty 2018). It is interesting to note that there was a large divergence in the sample, with a split emerging relatively quickly, within a week, between companies that subsequently gained value and those that lost a much greater share. Regardless of the outcome on the companies’ valuation, price volatility increased for all firms, signalling a higher risk associated with the firm increasing the cost of capital.","text",33
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Thelongest-termevaluation of the effects of revelations of unethical businesspractisescomes from Long et al (2016) who examined the effect announcement of various ethical violations, including bribery/illegal payments, employee discrimination, environmental pollution, and insider trading over a much larger timescale of 5-20+ years. They still found significant effects after 5 years, with -0.0357% (p=0.025) lower average daily return of firms with an announcement of unethical behaviour compared to other firms in their industries(Long 2016). Although they found no significant effect for all time frames greater than five years, statistically significant effects that persist across such long time frames suggest such announcements represent real persistent damage to the company's value.","text",34
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","To give a sense of the loss in market capitalisation these figures can represent, we can expand on theshort-termeffect found from anti-sweatshop campaigns by Rock (2003). Here they found a statistically significant effect on market capitalisation from as high as $166.6 million for Target to $3.25 million for K-Mart, with an average loss in market capitalization of $69.9 million or 0.82%(Rock 2003). Interestingly, the inverse effect was then observed for good news when Reebok, a shoe retailer, agreed to phase out the use of sweatshop labour with an abnormal return of 1.65% or $19.35 million. The effect on company value found across the studies cited above is more consistent in percentage terms varying from ~1-5%, however for total market capitalisation, this can mean much greater losses for larger companies.","text",35
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","More broadly, there are numerous case studies of scandals or campaigns that seem to have even more significantly reduced the reputation, value, and revenue of companies over the longer term. These include Chipotle, which lost almost two-thirds of its market value from an E. coli scandal(Bowman 2017), Wells Fargo, which lost $29 billion (9.2%) of its market value after a scandal about their business practices(Glazer 2018), and SeaWorld, which lost 50% of its market value over two years after the documentary titled ‘Blackfish’ was released(Stokes and Atkins-Sayre 2018).","text",36
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","One weakness of a lot of these event analysis studies is that they only analyse the effect of such announcements onshort-term(a few days to a week) stock price fluctuations. The studies that examine a longer time frame of a year or more give a better sense of thelong-termdamage such scandals or campaigns can cause. Isolating the truly long term effects of these campaigns or scandals becomes increasingly difficult as companies are likely to have responded to the damage to their reputation and stock returns with policy changes that counteract their effects. Still, even if verylong-termshifts are not achieved, CEOs confronted with scandals of such magnitude will face compensation penalties or dismissal based on the short andmedium-termeffects(Crisp 2021).","text",37
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Another problem with generalising from these studies is that they only select the most ‘notable’ examples of campaigns that received a lot of media attention, thus making researchers aware of their existence. This means that these findings are most relevant to the effect of a successful campaign rather than the average effect of all campaigns.","text",38
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","In the same vein, all of the firms examined are public facing and traded with established reputations, whereas many firms within animal agriculture are privately owned and have some of the worst reputations, such as slaughtering companies(Albersmeier and Spiller 2008). Additionally, the animal agriculture industry already has a very critical perception from a number of stakeholders(Luhmann and Theuvsen 2016). Thus, these findings will not necessarily include campaigns targeted at producers or other actors further down the supply chain. The food retail and grocery industry, particularly higher end brands that put much larger stock in their reputation, are more likely to experience the significant and lasting damage from association with unethical practices observed in the literature.","text",39
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","If we take these estimates at face value, successful campaigns or revelations of unethical behaviour can reduce the value of affected firms between 1-5% in at least the short to medium term. If we apply this general heuristic to the food and grocery retail industry with an evaluation of $750 billion in the US(Grand View Research 2022)and £205 billion in the UK(Bedford 2022), then successful campaigns should do between $7.5 to $37.5 billion worth of damage in the US and £2 to £10 billion worth of damage in the UK. If we compare this to the estimated $6 billion investment required to shift from cage to cage-free systems in the US(Wong 2017)which has widespread success with gaining commitments, this figure looks quite reasonable.","text",40

"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","A tacit assumption in the disruption and reputation model of a corporate campaign is that companies act as rational actors who seek the least costly solution acting in accordance with the rational choice theory of organisational decision making. However, there is broad agreement in the existing literature that rational choice models do not reflect the real-world reality of individual decision making. This does not discount these models entirely, with the typical economic reasoning being that any individual will perform in ways we can't predict, but collective behaviour should act more in line with the economic theory long term.","text",42
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Some researchers have made efforts to move towards descriptive models of decision making for which all observed decision making could be described, but these efforts also seem to have failed(Dillon 1998). Instead, each organisation may act according to a number of decision-making models or motivations, or vary the tool used across time or between contexts. Therefore, when attempting to model and anticipate the decision making and behaviour of organisations, one should not weigh any given model too heavily without significant previous experience of the behaviour of the organisations and decision-makers involved. These models can improve our ability to predict an organisation’s behaviour, but should be accompanied with observations of their motivations for previous decisions.","text",43
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","In the context of a corporate campaign, it is not uncommon for organisations to comply with activists' demands even when it may not be in their best interest to do so(Spar and La Mure 2003). In such instances, management may have strong commitments to the goals expressed by their potential critics. Unfortunately, the motivations for compliance with corporate campaigns have not been directly studied. Instead we can look at the wider literature on the general motivations of firms for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, of which animal welfare is considered a part.","text",44
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Broadly, companies’ motivations for CSR activities can be split into intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Extrinsic motivations for CSR hold that CSR is instrumental for the goals of the company in the long run. This includes corporate reputation and the financial benefits that can accrue from this (examined in previous sections). Intrinsic motivations, on the other hand, come from business cultures that are committed to certain business principles, including moral duties(Graafland and van de Ven 2006). The relative importance of each motivation within these categories varies between industries, based on industry characteristics, relevant stakeholders, and the structure of their supply chain. However, some broad factors emerge across industries and contexts, and these can be seen as universal motivations for CSR.","text",45
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Zhang et al (2018) conducted a systematic review of the available literature to identify the drivers, motivations and barriers to CSR in the construction industry(Zhang, Oo, and Lim 2019). Through content analysis they identified three external drivers of CSR; policy pressure, market pressure, and innovation and technology. These act as external coercive forces that can ‘force’ a corporation to undertake CSR activities. Alongside this, the most common internal motivations reported by companies were financial benefits, reputation, and organisational culture, which encompasses intrinsic motivations. Unfortunately, barriers to implementation were far more diverse, suggesting that there are a wide variety of potential barriers that vary across contexts. However, none apart from lack of knowledge or awareness of CSR within the organisation were that common.","text",46
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","In the energy sector, Agudelo et al (2020) conducted a systematic review on the drivers that motivate energy companies to adopt CSR(Latapí Agudelo, Johannsdottir, and Davidsdottir 2020).

"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","In the financial sector, Wu et al (2013) studied the motives of banks to engage in CSR in part to understand the varied relationship between CSR and financial performance(Wu and Shen 2013). They found that the main drivers were strategic instrumental reasons, altruism (conducting CSR for its own sake), and greenwashing, which attempts to enhance corporate image without significantly changing the business.","text",48
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","These same motivations have also been observed in decision makers in many other contexts, such as professional sports(Babiak and Trendafilova 2009)and in a wider sample of firms in developing economies(Ali, Wilson, and Husnain 2022).","text",49
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Cross-industry studies have found some general trends among the motivation of firms depending on size. In a survey of 111 large and small Dutch firms, Graafland et al (2006) found that large firms were more confident about the financial payoff of CSR than smaller firms on average, as the reputational mechanism is more important to them and they tend to have a longer time horizon than other companies in their industry. However, this difference was quite small with all firms reporting high agreement with both moral and strategic motivation for CSR(Graafland and van de Ven 2006). It was also of note that there was a stronger correlation between moral motivations and CSR performance than the strategic view.","text",50
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Although theselarger-scaleindustry-wide reviews of CSR do provide us with the general motivations for CSR, given variation in industry characteristics the main barriers will differ across industries. Fortunately, there has been some research into the use of CSR in the food industry supply chain. As with other industries, the main drivers behind CSR are improved competitiveness, scrutinisation by stakeholders, reputation, and legitimacy(Luhmann and Theuvsen 2016; Heyder and Theuvsen 2012). However, compared to other industries there is a greater emphasis on the pressure from NGOs, with this being the most frequently mentioned motivation or concern driving CSR in agribusiness(Maloni and Brown 2006; Hartmann 2011). It is also frequently noted that this pressure is most likely to be targeted at larger firms, making them more likely to implement CSR practices.","text",51
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","The existing literature on motivation for firm CSR initiatives is frequently subject to numerous methodological problems. Most notably, low response rates skew the sample towards those more actively involved in CSR, and possible social desirability bias towards more moral and less financial motivations.","text",52
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","From the existing research on the drivers of CSR across all industries we see that consistent motivations are strategic, reputational, and moral. These findings align with theories surrounding the mechanisms for corporate campaigns through the strategic and reputational motivations. The final motivation, moral, can be observed in industry leaders who sometimes choose to implement CSR or improved welfare practices either before activists begin any outreach or during the corporate outreach stage before any threats of a public campaign. These companies then act as examples for others, showing that the improvements are possible, and they can lead the way for their peers through the process of institutional isomorphism(Frank den Hond 2007).","text",53
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Thus we can see that to measure the motivation of different companies, and how much it is possible to push for, we must both understand the value of and damage a corporate campaign can do to a reputation as well as the intrinsic motivations of key decision makers. The extrinsic motivation in some sense acts as a lower bound to the investment a firm should be willing to pay to maintain its good standing amongst its stakeholders, while intrinsic moral motivations can increase this further for some firms. However, in this case it is important to note the general finding that pushing on extrinsic motivation tends to diminish intrinsic motivations for an action(Frey and Jegen 2001).","text",54

"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","The damage that revelations of unethical business practices or corporate campaigns can do is significant. However, there are other barriers that may prevent a firm from complying with the requests of activists.","text",56
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Sheoin (2014) outlines various possible explanations for the failure of a number of previous corporate campaigns(Mac Sheoin 2014). Some of the reasons outlined that are behind the failure of previous campaigns revolve around mistakes or the tactics used. For example, during Greenpeace's campaign over the disposal of the offshore oil rig ‘Brent Spar’, a mistake in the estimation of the amount of toxic material on the rig was used to cast doubt on Greenpeace's scientific credentials. Another example is when the BBC interviewed an activist posing as a spokesperson for a company responsible for a chemical leak in India that killed more than 15,000 people, resulting in less favourable framing for the victims by the media.","text",57
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Another factor that can affect the success of campaigns is the structure of the industry. Schurman (2004) argues that ‘industry structures confer particular strategic openings and closures on social movements and render firms and industries more or less vulnerable to social movement actions’(Schurman 2004). These include broader structures of the whole industry, such as the level of competition in an industry. More competition incentivises companies to seek to enhance their market positions or maintain them by mimicking the capitulation of other firms. In a similar vein, industries in which brand name and/or reputation is important to competition should be more vulnerable to attack(Debora L. Spar 2008; Mac Sheoin 2014). These include industries with more concentrated pressure points in their commodity chain such as a small number of buyers, particularly if these buyers have weaker social and economic relationships with the suppliers. For example, if a country's retail market is dominated by four firms and the product targeted is only a minor motivation for consumers to shop at that retailer such as goats cheese.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","The product as a whole can make the industry more vulnerable to attacks, such as products with negative health effects, have a negative environmental impact, or widely offending people’s moral sensibilities. However, a broad protective element for an industry is if it offers significant economic, national security, or political benefits to a state (or ruling party), where it will then receive greater state protection against challengers(Schurman 2004).","text",59
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Vulnerabilities can also occur at the company level, such as associations with stakeholders with poor reputations, or if a company has made public commitments around a cause or proclaims a value that it can be reasonably shown not to uphold(Schurman 2004).","text",60
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Outside of industry-wide or firm-level considerations, as predicted by a model of companies as rational actors, we find that higher transactions push firms towards the path of resistance(Debora L. Spar 2008). This is typically evaluated from a financial cost perspective, but should also be considered from a logistical or knowledge perspective. With this being a commonly cited reason for barriers to general social responsibility(Zhang, Oo, and Lim 2019). This is common with corporate social responsibility, or more friendly campaigns where initial cooperation with the industry is to educate them on alternative business practices. Alternatively, if a practice is currently integral to the supply chain and alternatives are not easily available, then regardless of what it may theoretically cost to shift this will not be seen as possible for the industry. An example of this would be where chick culling was 10 years ago, when the technology was in development but no concrete examples or alternatives were available. A corporate campaign on a topic such as this would be futile.","text",61
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Another element of the ask which has been shown to affect the likelihood that companies respond positively to interest groups requests is request legitimacy(Eesley and Lenox 2006). This can be defined as the degree to which the issue raised by a stakeholder group request is well accepted and well defined by the public. Thus simpler asks that are more understandable to the general public will generally elicit a positive response suggesting composite asks are more difficult to campaign for, with the possible exception ofcertifier-basedcampaigns such as the fair trade campaigns or Aquatic Animal Alliance’s certifier campaign.","text",62

"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","Given the theoretical background of corporate campaigns and observations of barriers to companies' capitulation to demands, there are a few indicators or research methods we can use to assess the tractability of a corporate ask.","text",76
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","The first, as outlined above, is by constructing a theoretical rational choice model of the company's or industry's decisions. This compares the full economic cost of the choice to comply with an interest group's demands to the reputational and financial damage the group is able to achieve through an anti-corporate campaign(Baron and Diermeier 2007). This includes both capital investment and the effect of ongoing price changes on the profitability of an industry. Thus, this evaluation would include the full net present cost of shifting the industry to the improved practice. Additional elements for composite asks would be prioritised based on the cost-effectiveness of the improvement on welfare for the corporation, limiting for the number of elements determined by the expected damage a campaign could cause.  Under this model more elements could be included if improvements were cheap and easy to implement or the industry is particularly vulnerable to anti corporate campaigns. With examples of when this might be the case outlined in previous sections such as industries with larger more reputational driven firms in tight competition with each other and without a strong dependence on the product being targeted.","text",77

"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","The next method is developing an understanding of the context of the campaign, including the stakeholders involved in the supply chain for the product as well as the power dynamics between each other and attitudes towards potential improvements. This would require multiple different research projects, beginning with a map of the supply chain for the product. For animal products this would include all life stages. An example of what such a map would look like is found below. This would highlight the key actors involved and the level of dependency of each stage on others further up or down the supply chain, identifying pressure points that would be weak to a corporate campaign.","text",79

"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","When we have identified the key categories of companies present in the supply chain, the next project should be on creating a corporate profile of the likely targets for the campaign. This should include the number of individuals present in their supply chain, financial indicators, major stakeholders and the history of and pledges towards CSR and animal welfare. This, combined with profiles of key company executives, will identify companies that are more or less intrinsically motivated towards better animal welfare as well as which companies are weakest to anti-corporate campaigns.","text",82
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","The most difficult method for evaluating this is to directly survey target stakeholders or others in the supply chain about their willingness to adopt the practices and barriers or drivers for this. A good example of this is Sinclair et al (2019), who used focus group sessions with livestock industry leaders to discuss their willingness to embrace pre-slaughter stunning(Sinclair et al. 2019). Although in principle this could be achieved through a variety of methods including surveys, one-on-one interviews, or more intensively consensus methods for expert opinions such as the Delphi method(Hohmann, Cote, and Brand 2018). The main barrier to using this method will likely be the willingness of industry stakeholders to engage with activists in gathering the information.","text",83
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","CONCLUSION","text",84
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","As we can see from the available literature, corporate campaigns and scandals in relation to unethical business practices can cause significant and potentially long lasting damage to a firm's reputation and financial performance. Still additional research into the financial and reputation effects of historic animal advocacy corporate campaigns on retailers would help to ensure that these effects generalise to our specific context. From the existing research in related fields we observe that the damage to a firm depends on its size, existing reputation, and the efficacy of the campaign.","text",85
"https://www.animalask.org/post/corporate-campaigns-determining-the-scale-of-the-ask","If firms' motivations for compliance with interest groups demands was entirely based on a rational economic calculus, this could be used to evaluate the degree of financial investment activities organisations could push for with their campaigns. However, this simplistic model of firm behaviour does not translate to observed motivations for CSR and responses to previous campaigns. It fails to account for the intrinsic motivations of some firms as well as non-financial factors such as logistical or knowledge barriers to implementation. As well as the basic observation that humans don’t act according to this ‘ideal’ rational economic calculus. Therefore, although such simplistic models are able to provide some insight into the magnitude of the ask that can be made, they need to be used alongside an understanding of the specific context of the campaign including the supply chain, key stakeholders and their motivations. As corporate campaigns are ultimately social phenomena, precise quantitative estimates are not reliable, but various research methods can be used to make more informed decisions on the magnitude of the ask that can be made.","text",86

"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","An extensive report researching a ban on the import of products that don’t meet UK animal welfare standards.","text",10
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","OVERVIEW","text",11
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Whilst working with Animal Equality UK on their Ask Prioritisation, we saw an avenue for further exploration and prioritisation of asks within the wider UK context. We want our research to be as useful to as many groups as possible and as such, decided to run a simultaneous research process for the full UK context outside of the limitations of Animal Equality UK’s scope. We contacted all major animal advocacy organisations in this region and they were keen to understand the results of this UK-wide scoping following our research. We would like to thank the experts we looked to for guidance in this report.","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","This ask requires meat and animal products imported into the UK to meet the UK's standards on animal welfare during production. This could be achieved through a ban on importing products that do not meet the UK's welfare standards (whether all welfare standards or a set of core welfare standards). Such a ban would cause UK consumers to purchase less lower-welfare products and more higher-welfare products. This, in turn, would mean that there is an overall increase in higher-welfare production, improving the lives of farm animals. Additionally, when there are future welfare improvements made in the UK, this ask would also restrict the import of products that do not meet those future standards. Other versions of this ask include a ban on particular products (e.g. foie gras) or placing lower tariffs on higher-welfare products.","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Our cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that this ask has the potential to benefit a large number of animals. This analysis also suggests that most of the benefit would come from improving the lives of chickens who are raised for meat in Thailand and, to a lesser extent, Brazil. Given this, it could be a useful strategy to focus specifically on improving the welfare conditions of chickens destined for import to the UK. However, such a strategy may cause harm to people by reinforcing xenophobic ideas and causing jobs to be lost in those countries, and so the wellbeing of people would also need to be ensured.","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","This ask's tractability is uncertain, although we are cautiously optimistic given the right campaign. Public support is very high, with public opinion surveys generally finding that 75% or more of respondents are supportive. This ask also has the support of the farming industry, many non-governmental organisations, and some government departments. However, the support of MPs is more complex. There is a partisan divide, with Conservative MPs generally opposed, while MPs from all other major parties and most minor parties are supportive.","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Some additional uncertainties remain. First, it is unclear what proportion of imports this ask would apply to. The trade deals that account for most of the UK's imports are already finalised. If this ask only applies to future trade agreements or to trade outside current agreements, then only a minority of the UK's imports would be affected. However, the UK has not yet negotiated trade agreements with the US, the Mercosur countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay), or Thailand. Each of these deals offer scope for animal welfare improvements. Second, there is some uncertainty as to whether an import ban would survive a challenge under international law, although most legal analyses have concluded that such a ban would survive.","text",17
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Overall, we conclude that this ask has the potential to be high-impact and benefit the lives of many animals. We recommend that organisations in the UK consider this ask for a future campaign. We believe that it would be most effective for organisations to focus on securing commitments from parties in their manifestos for  the upcoming general election, for which there is a window of opportunity open now (mid-2022). We also believe that it would be effective to focus on collaborating with the farming community, and possibly building support among Conservative MPs. Corporate campaigns may also offer a way to achieve this ask.","text",18
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","DESCRIPTION OF THE ASK","text",19
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","This ask involves requiringmeat and animal products imported into the UK¹to meet the UK's standards on animal welfare during production. Most likely, this would require imports to meet a set of particular core welfare standards, rather than all domestic welfare standards (Trade & Animal Welfare Coalition 2021a).","text",20
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Currently, the UK is in the process of negotiating numerous trade agreements, given the country's recent exit from the EU. This ask could be implemented via a clause in these trade agreements that requires imports to meet UK animal welfare standards; or a Bill applying this requirement across all trading partners; or a Bill giving MPs the power to place this requirement on particular products. Each of these mechanisms would have different benefits and risks. For example, implementing this ask within trade agreements would have much lower legal risk; a Bill implementing a blanket ban would be much faster and more comprehensive; and a power enabling the MPs to decide requirements might allow welfare standards on imports to increase more easily in the future. There are alternative options, including multilateral agreements, preferential tariffs, labelling, and retailer action (see section ""Alternative policies""). This ask has been promoted by several animal advocacy organisations (Stevenson 2018).","text",21
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","During the UK's ongoing trade negotiations, government departments, many non-governmental organisations, and many members of the farming community have expressed concerns about unrestricted imports of lower-welfare meat and animal products. Such imports present three main risks for animal welfare (Offor 2020). Firstly, lower-welfare imports can dilute the UK market, increasing demand by UK consumers for cheaper, lower-welfare products. Secondly, lower-welfare imports may come to dominate the UK's market, expanding lower-welfare production in other countries (Grethe 2007). Thirdly, since lower-welfare products are cheaper to produce, UK farmers may not be able to compete with foreign producers (House of Lords 2017). As such, farmers may pressure the UK government to abandon, weaken, or slow the improvement of the UK’s welfare standards (Trade and Agriculture Commission 2021; House of Lords 2017; Offor 2020).","text",22
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Ideally, this ask would avert these three risks. It is unlikely that this ask would actually change standards in other countries, though this depends on how important the UK market is to each particular industry within a given country (Cox 2020).","text",23
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","THEORY OF CHANGE","text",24
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","The causal chain of this ask is summarised below. To begin, the UK government restricts imports on meat and animal products produced to welfare standards lower than the UK’s. This causes UK consumers to purchase less lower-welfare products and more higher-welfare products. This, in turn, means that there is an overall increase in higher-welfare production, improving the lives of farm animals.","text",25
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Additionally, this ask might also apply to future asks in the UK. In other words, when there are future welfare improvements made in the UK, this ask would also restrict the import of products that do not meet those future standards. We expect that this effect would be most significant if legal protections are granted to fish, but this effect is also relevant to welfare improvements for other groups of animals. Although this would depend on how this ask is implemented in legislation, we believe that this dimension of the ask may magnify its overall impact considerably. Separately, this ask might enable the UK government to increase domestic standards even further, as there could be greater acceptance of higher standards among the UK farming community if such standards are applied to imports in parallel.","text",26
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","There may also be some exporting countries that increase their animal welfare standards to gain access to the UK market, whether via individual farms increasing their standards or governments introducing new regulations. However, we believe that this effect would be small (Cox 2020).","text",27
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","COMPARING ANIMAL WELFARE IN THE UK AND TRADE PARTNERS","text",28
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Here, we summarise some key differences in farm animal welfare standards between the UK and its trade partners. These descriptions are not exhaustive. Rather, we intend to list some of the key differences between animal welfare standards in the UK and its trade partners as one way of illustrating the practices that may change if this ask is implemented. In other words, these are some of the concrete ways that animals may benefit from this ask.","text",29
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","For this section, we have selected five trade partners that we believe are particularly relevant for this ask. The EU is responsible for the vast majority of the UK's trade in agricultural products. Similarly, Australia and New Zealand are of particular relevance for certain meat products. However, those three trading partners have already agreed on the details of trade agreements with the UK. If this ask is implemented as a blanket import ban, then this ask could still apply to those trade agreements. It remains unclear what form this ask would take in reality. Given this, we also discuss two trade partners that are responsible for large amounts of trade in meat and animal products, but have not yet agreed on post-Brexit trade agreements with the UK: the US and Mercosur (a trade bloc consisting of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay). Note that further details on the current state of trade negotiations are given in the ""Progress of trade agreements"" section.","text",30

"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Overall, the EU has very similar animal welfare standards to the UK (Stevenson 2018). This is unsurprising, given the fact that the UK was a member state of the EU until recently. Critically, the EU is also exploring this ask - the Presidency recently commissioned a report that will explore whether imports could be restricted based on standards of animal welfare, health, and the environment (European Commission 2022).","text",53
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","However, there are some notable differences between countries. In the ""Protecting animals used in farming"" section of the Animal Protection Index, EU countries scored B (two countries), C (three countries), D (four countries) and F (one country). This compares to the UK's score of D. Notably, only one EU country scored worse than the UK: Romania, which scored F.","text",54
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Furthermore, the UK has begun the process of transposing EU animal welfare legislation into UK law. In doing so, the UK is taking the opportunity to review animal welfare standards and improve these standards where possible (House of Lords 2017). For example, the UK government is currently reviewing the limits on animal transport times. Similarly, the Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill, if passed, would ban the live export of animals.","text",55
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","If the UK does improve animal welfare standards, then this ask may improve the lives of animals in the EU. Also, if this ask isnotimplemented, then the existence of a free-trade agreement with the EU might discourage the government from making large improvements to welfare.","text",56
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Therefore, this ask may bring some benefits to animals in the EU. However, given the close similarity between the animal welfare standards in the UK and the EU, we expect that these benefits would be small. On top of this, the UK and the EU have already concluded a trade agreement, so whether this ask affects animals in the EU depends on how this ask is implemented.","text",57

In fact, New Zealand has better animal welfare standards than the UK in some instances. In the ""Protecting animals used in farming"" section of the Animal Protection Index, New Zealand scored a C compared to the UK's score of D.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","In August 2020, 2,065 adults in England were asked: ""The UK Government made a commitment during the December 2019 General Election to not lower animal welfare standards in trade agreements with other countries after Brexit (i.e. after the UK left the European Union).

Interestingly, higher age appeared to be associated with higher agreement. This statement was framed in terms of the government honouring a commitment, which may have affected the level of support among respondents.

In July 2020, the House of Commons debated adding a clause to the Trade Bill that would have implemented this ask. Specifically, the clause would have required the UK's trade agreements to only allow the import of goods that meet the UK's standards in animal welfare (as well as  other areas). The House of Commons rejected this clause. This vote was essentially made along party lines. 337 MPs voted against this clause, including almost every Conservative MP. 251 MPs voted for this clause, including all MPs from Labour and the SNP, and most MPs from minor parties (UK Parliament 2020c).","text",98

The manifesto of the Conservative Party (2019) contained a commitment not to compromise on animal welfare standards in trade negotiations. Likewise, the Right Honourable Liz Truss MP - Secretary of State for International Trade at the time - appears to have made a similar commitment.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","However, the government appears to be strongly motivated to secure trade agreements, likely driven by domestic pressure to deliver on promises made prior to Brexit.

For example, in December 2021, an open letter advocating for further scrutiny of the UK-Australia trade agreement was sent to the Secretary of State for International Trade.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","The Swiss Parliament (2019), as part of their justification for rejecting this ask, claimed that a ban on lower-welfare imports is very difficult and resource-intensive to enforce. To successfully enforce a ban on lower-welfare imports, the UK government must monitor imports and penalise non-compliance. Given the immense number of existing regulations on imports that are enforced and penalised at the border, this task is comparatively trivial. This enforcement could also involve penalising UK companies that sell lower-welfare imports, as an alternative to directly penalising overseas companies. Thus, corporations would be motivated to monitor the standards of their imports.","text",114
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","The process of deciding on and implementing a set of standards is very similar to trade policies in other areas, such as labour rights and greenhouse gas emissions. A current example comes from the EU, which is designing a policy to increase the price of imports with high greenhouse gas emissions (European Commission 2019). Although this policy is indeed complex to implement (Kuusi et al. 2020), it shows that a jurisdiction can design a policy that restricts or bans imports based on a nuanced criterion. We believe that a policy focused on animal welfare would be similarly complex, but feasible, to implement.","text",115

"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","The biggest question facing this ask is whether it is legal to restrict trade based on animal welfare under international law (House of Lords 2017). It is legal to restrict lower-welfare trade under a bilateral agreement or multilateral treaty. However, where trade does not occur under the terms of an agreement or treaty, the picture is more nuanced.","text",141
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","The first legal question is whether two meat products or animal products that are produced under different welfare conditions are considered 'like products'. If they arenotconsidered 'like products', then it is legal under international trade law to discriminate between them (Ghislain 2021). This could involve a trade ban or differential tariffs. While there are some tentative suggestions that this is the case, the question has not been resolved conclusively in case law (Ghislain 2021).","text",142
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Even if two meat products or animal products that are produced under different welfare conditionsareconsidered 'like products', it may still be possible to discriminate between them. Here, the relevant piece of international law is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This treaty is a multilateral agreement enforced under the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The GATT was designed to promote trade by reducing tariffs and other trade restrictions. The UK has many obligations under the GATT, and there are many ways that trade restrictions based on animal welfare could violate these obligations (Blattner 2019). This would suggest that restricting trade based on animal welfare is against international law.","text",143
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","However, the GATT also includes some exceptions, which allow countries to restrict trade under particular circumstances. The most relevant of these exceptions is Article XX(a) of the GATT, which enables countries to adopt measures ""necessary to protect public morals"".","text",144
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","In 1998, there was an eruption of public debate in the EU about seal hunting. This debate caused the EU to place a ban on selling seals and seal products in the EU. The ban, which was primarily motivated by the desire to protect these animals, was challenged by Canada and Norway at the WTO. However, it was ruled that protecting animals did fall under the definition of 'public morals' (Blattner 2019).","text",145
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","This case law indicates that trade restrictions based on animal welfare can indeed be justified under  Article XX(a) of the GATT (Blattner 2019; Offor and Walter 2017). The analysis by Offor and Walter (2017) supports this conclusion. They found a consensus among scholars that, given the outcome of theSealscase, GATT Article XX(a) can indeed be used as justification for restricting trade on animal welfare grounds. Such restrictions, to be justified, must also meet particular criteria. For example, the restriction must be necessary to achieve the desired animal welfare objective, must refer to animal welfare within the relevant legal document, must apply to all exporting countries equally, and must be the least restrictive option available to achieve the desired result (Offor and Walter 2017). However, it should be noted that theSealscase focused on wild animals. The ability to use the 'public morals' exemption to protect animal welfare has not yet been confirmed by case law in the context of farmed animals (Ghislain 2021).","text",146
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Indeed, an exemption under GATT Article XX(a) is cited as the most promising avenue by animal advocacy organisations who support a ban on lower-welfare products (Trade & Animal Welfare Coalition 2021b). An EU official, speaking anonymously and in the context of imports into the EU, claimed that trade restrictions based on animal welfare could be designed to be consistent with WTO rules (Foote 2021). The EU currently restricts the import of meat from animals slaughtered to lower welfare standards, a restriction that has not been challenged at the WTO (Cox 2020). Importantly, the UK House of Lords (2017) notes that some doubt remains around the legality of a trade restriction based on animal welfare given this remains untested at the WTO.","text",147
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","There is only one other trade agreement that includes a concrete regulation based on animal welfare. In 2019, the EU and the Mercosur countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay) reached a trade agreement that contains a clause requiring eggs to be produced to EU standards of animal welfare in order to benefit from zero tariffs (Cox 2020; European Commission 2019). Importantly, this agreement is at the stage of agreement-in-principle, meaning that the final text has not yet been published or implemented. There are also several trade agreements that pledge cooperation on matters of animal welfare (such as the EU's agreements with Chile, with Mexico, and with South Korea), but these do not contain any concrete regulations of trade.","text",148

"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","The UK government does not appear worried about the WTO risk, and most legal analyses have concluded that this ask would survive a challenge at the WTO (Offor and Walter 2017).

Experts also stated that the government is unlikely to be concerned by the small risk of non-compliance with this law.","text",159
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Overall, the experts expressed concerns about the political will for this ask due to the restrictions this would place on trade negotiations. The current UK Government has an interest in making Brexit appear successful, which requires trade deals to be secured. Due to this, animal welfare is a much lower priority for the government, making it highly unlikely that the government would risk the success of trade negotiations for the sake of animal welfare. There have also been reports that Defra is more supportive of this ask than the Department of International Trade (Casalicchio 2021), though the Secretary of State for Trade has changed since then.","text",160
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","At the upcoming UK general election, there is a chance that the Conservative party will concede government to the Labour party (date unknown, but likely 2023 or 2024). One expert indicated that a Labour government would have no need to make Brexit look successful, so the agenda of such a government would be more malleable. Also, historically, Labour MPs have always voted in favour of this ask in Parliament. However, this ask is likely to be a low priority even for a Labour government. Any government is also likely to have limited attention for animal welfare given the COVID-19 pandemic and the current war in Ukraine.","text",161

They also highlighted some useful strategies. There is a window now (mid 2022, the time of writing) to campaign for the major political parties to write this ask into their manifestos for the upcoming general election. In addition, many farmers are supportive of this ask, as this ask is likely to protect domestic farmers from international competition. The government may pay greater attention to the demands of the farming community. Therefore, it may help to campaign in a coalition with representatives of the farming community, such as the National Farmers Union.","text",162

The next largest group was sheep farmed for wool (7-12%). In Scenario 1 only, there were also large numbers of pigs (7%) and chickens farmed for eggs (7%) who benefitted.","text",171
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","In all four scenarios, the benefits were dominated by chickens farmed for meat. In Scenarios 2-4, the overwhelming majority of this meat was imported in the form of canned chicken from Thailand and, to a lesser extent, Brazil.","text",172
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","This suggests that focusing the ask on chickens (and perhaps campaigning on the basis of welfare conditions in Thailand specifically) may be a way to make the ask more attractive to the government while also retaining the majority of the benefits for animals. Indeed, the chicken imported from Thailand appears to have been produced in Thailand. Thailand's stated aim is to be the ""kitchen of the world"", and the country exports chickens to many countries (Ipsos Business Consulting 2013). The highest volumes go to Japan and the EU. Since the EU has also been considering this ask, there is a chance that the EU and the UK could both implement restrictions on the imports of lower-welfare chicken products. Speculatively, this could encourage Thailand's chicken industry to improve chicken welfare to adapt to these new restrictions by the major importers that are the EU and the UK. Although Thailand's farmed animal standards are low, the welfare standards for chickens do seem to have improved in recent years (World Animal Protection 2020b; Johnson 2018). A campaign that adopts this strategy should first research the specific ways in which Thailand's chicken welfare standards differ from those in the UK.","text",173
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Conversely, this strategy would forego the benefits that arise from future welfare gains for non-chicken animals. For example, welfare improvements for pigs or fish would not be automatically accompanied by a requirement for imports to also meet those improvements. This strategy may also have less support among farmers who farm other species.","text",174
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Notably, we did not include fish in the main CEA. Given that fish are given very limited legal protections, it is unlikely that a ban on lower-welfare products would benefit fish in the short-term. However, such a ban may benefit fish if they are given more legal protections in the future. This is most likely for farmed fish, as there are several ongoing campaigns to improve welfare standards for farmed fish. For this reason, considering farmed fish is one way to understand the potential long-term benefits of this ask. In the CEA, including farmed fish multiplies the number of animals affected by between two and six. This suggests that this ask, if it applies to fish at a future point, may have long-term benefits that substantially exceed the short-term benefits.","text",175
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","There are some key challenges in modelling this ask in a CEA. Firstly, it is very difficult to predict the UK's future trade patterns. We assumed that the UK's existing trade patterns will continue into the future. However, given that the UK is currently negotiating numerous trade agreements, this assumption is probably unrealistic. Secondly, we only have a tentative idea of which countries have lower animal welfare standards than the UK. This makes it difficult to understand how many animals would be affected by this ask. Thirdly, the trade patterns of Northern Ireland are likely to be different, given the effects of the Northern Ireland Protocol. Furthermore, in the CEA, we have assumed that different versions of the ask apply to different sets of countries. But it is also possible for different versions of the ask to apply to different welfare standards (e.g. a core set of welfare standards rather than all UK domestic welfare standards), and there is insufficient data to capture this in our CEA. And lastly, due to limitations of the available data, there remains uncertainty around the number of animals imported into the UK.","text",176
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","ALTERNATIVE POLICIES","text",177
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","In this report, we have mostly described this ask as a complete ban on any imported food or agricultural product that was not produced to UK standards or better. However, there are several alternative asks that may improve the welfare standards of imports while also being more politically tractable.","text",178
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","A multilateral agreement on welfare standards","text",179
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","One alternative to this ask involves a multilateral agreement on animal welfare standards. A multilateral agreement involves multiple countries voluntarily agreeing to the same set of standards. In the context of animal welfare, this may involve agreeing to a particular set of minimum welfare standards in agricultural production (Grethe 2007). This agreement would likely take the form of a broad umbrella treaty, which can then be used to design and adopt more specific protocols (Favre 2016).","text",180
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Such an agreement would give more credibility and political leverage to animal advocacy efforts in countries that have ratified the agreement. It would also help to avoid incentives to reduce animal welfare standards. Furthermore, there is a chance that this alternative would be politically palatable for the UK government. This would allow the government to show leadership in animal protection - honouring their manifesto commitment - without actually restricting their negotiations in trade agreements. This alternative would also be very beneficial for the broader animal advocacy movement, making future animal welfare gains more tractable in many countries (Favre 2016).","text",181
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","There are some potential risks to a multilateral treaty on animal welfare. Firstly, the process of establishing such a treaty could be captured by the animal agriculture industry (Favre 2016). This regulatory capture could increase the reputation and power of the industry while bringing minimal or negligible benefits to animals' lives (Goodfellow 2016; Favre 2016; Duffield 2020). Secondly, a treaty might lock in a welfarist mindset (as opposed to a rights-oriented mindset) to animal protection among the global community. The merits of these two mindsets are heavily debated by animal advocates (e.g. Francione and Garner 2010). Nevertheless, given that this alternative is potentially tractable and may bring widespread benefit to animals globally, we are particularly enthusiastic about this alternative.","text",182
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","There have been previous attempts to establish multilateral agreements on animal welfare. One proposed agreement is the International Convention for the Protection of Animals. This Convention, and the efforts made to bring it to the attention of policymakers, are discussed by Favre (2016).","text",183
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","A more recent attempt is the Convention on Animal Protection⁴. This Convention was drafted by a group of lawyers and academics following a resolution by the American Bar Association (2021) urging countries to develop a multilateral agreement for the protection of animals. The draft text of the Convention recognises animals as sentient beings whose welfare interests and wellbeing must be protected from unnecessary suffering. The paragraph most relevant to animals used for agriculture reads:","text",184
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","""The Contracting Parties shall take all necessary steps to ensure that commercial animals are provided an appropriate species-specific environment and the necessary care for their well-being, and to prevent cruelty to or unnecessary suffering of commercial animals.""","text",185
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","While this is a vague commitment, the Convention would facilitate the adoption of specific protocols that provide more concrete benefits for animals (Favre 2016). Similarly, this paragraph provides a commitment that can be leveraged by animal advocacy organisations in campaigning and lobbying governments for concrete animal welfare improvements.","text",186
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Preferential tariffs","text",187
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Another alternative to an import ban is to use preferential tariffs. This involves placing lower tariffs on imports that do meet the UK's animal welfare standards than on those imports that do not. For this alternative to succeed, the tariffs on lower-welfare imports would need to be expensive enough to discourage these imports (Cox 2020).","text",188
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Preferential tariffs are a more moderate ask than an import ban. Preferential tariffs allow for lower-welfare imports if an exporting company is willing to pay the higher tariffs. While preferential tariffs still allow lower-welfare products to enter the UK market, this is a way to limit the market reach of lower-welfare products. Therefore, preferential tariffs may improve the lives of fewer animals than an import ban. However, it is possible that preferential tariffs may be more politically palatable to the UK government. The key difficulties of preferential tariffs are the additional bureaucratic costs in establishing them and the potential of conflicting with WTO laws (Grethe 2007). Additionally, tariffs bring the risk of being lowered over time, which may reduce the benefits that this alternative can bring to animals. Given these arguments, we believe that preferential tariffs are still likely to be a reasonably impactful ask if a full import ban is not politically tractable.","text",189
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Labelling","text",190
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","A further alternative is food labelling. This would involve labelling all meat and animal products sold in the UK, including imports, so that consumers can determine the welfare standards under which any particular product was produced. These labels can be voluntary - producers that do meet animal welfare standards are entitled to use a positive label - or obligatory - producers that do not meet animal welfare standards must use a negative label (Grethe 2007). Food labels, if appropriately designed and implemented, are potentially legal under WTO rules (Offor 2020; Grethe 2007).","text",191
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Food labelling is generally seen as an appropriate policy if the goal is to address consumer concerns (Wilkinson 2020; Offor 2020). This is the policy that was preferred by the Federal Council in Switzerland when it debated the topic of lower-welfare imports (The Swiss Parliament 2019). However, in the Swiss context, experts have expressed scepticism that food labelling has had any effect (Bridgwater, Gittins, and Odene 2022). Also, consumer concerns are not the primary problem with importing lower-welfare food since the biggest costs are incurred by the animals who are raised for food. Lower-welfare imports are also opposed by UK food producers.","text",192
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","The alternative of food labelling would mean that any benefits to animals are entirely dependent on public purchasing behaviour. This would reduce the impact of this ask for animals. On top of this, labelling food with animal welfare standards is already being considered by the UK government, with Defra leading a public consultation (Animal Welfare Market Interventions Team 2021). Therefore, we believe that food labelling is a poor alternative to an import ban.","text",193
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Retailer action","text",194
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","The final alternative to an import ban is retailer action. Retailer action involves supermarkets and other stores refusing to stock particular products. A number of UK supermarkets have already pledged not to sell chlorine-washed chicken, and some have also pledged not to sell hormone-fed beef (Staples and Bergman 2020).","text",195
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Compared to an import ban, retailer action is limited. Retailer action depends on the support and action of numerous companies. Also, retail action is likely to focus on products that face substantial public opposition or a targeted campaign. This means that retailer action is probably only able to prevent a handful of practices harmful to animals. This is far less comprehensive than an import ban, which would likely prevent any harmful practices that are banned in the UK. Lastly, retailer action faces key hurdles to its success, such as the failure to follow through on a pledge (Sarek 2019; Šimčikas 2019b).","text",196

"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","One of the most crucial considerations for this ask is the value of additional advocacy efforts in this area. In 2020, a report on this topic found that experts are unenthusiastic about a new charity working in this area unless it can bring something new to advocacy efforts (Cox 2020). However, that report was written in the context of forming a new charity committed to just this ask and it may still be worthwhile for existing organisations to commit resources towards this ask. Our expert interviews were indeed supportive of committing additional resources towards this ask (see above, ""Expert Interviews"").","text",199
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","There are already a few animal advocacy organisations working on this ask in the UK. These organisations are largely concentrated under two umbrella groups: Eurogroup for Animals and the Trade & Animal Welfare Coalition. Together, these umbrella groups represent 14 organisations that have expressed support for restricting trade on lower-welfare imports. (We are also aware of at least one organisation working, more broadly, on trade and animal welfare in the UK.) However, while all of these organisations have expressed support for this ask, only a handful have actually committed significant resources to a campaign on this ask. Previous efforts have also failed to achieve this ask. Therefore, we believe that there is more space for further effort than the figure of ""14 organisations"" would initially suggest.","text",200
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","A critical question is how best to focus new effort. Useful campaigns could involve securing commitments from parties in their manifestos for  the upcoming general election, building support among Conservative MPs, and collaborating with the farming community.","text",201
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","The biggest challenges with this ask are the difficulties in seeking an import ban by lobbying the government. We have spoken with some people who are enthusiastic about pursuing an import ban through corporate campaigns. This could involve identifying the companies that are responsible for importing large quantities of lower-welfare animal products into the UK - perhaps chicken from Thailand specifically - and encouraging those companies to increase the animal welfare standards of their imports.","text",202
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Impacts on human wellbeing","text",203
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","There are a number of ways that this ask may affect human wellbeing. In countries with which the UK trades, this ask may lead to changes in employment patterns and economic opportunities. Such changes may have profound effects, positive and/or negative, on the lives of people. Since there is a correlation between per-capita income and farm animal welfare across countries, this ask risks moving employment from lower-income countries to higher-income countries. More broadly, animal advocacy has a history of being used to oppress people who undertake practices that do not conform to mainstream Western ideals (Feliz 2019; Blattner 2019). Given this, advocating against lower-welfare practices overseas may reinforce harmful racial prejudices (Kymlicka and Donaldson 2014; Feliz 2017). This is a particular risk with this ask, as most of the impact comes from improving the lives of chickens raised for meat and the majority of chicken meat imports currently come from Thailand and Brazil.","text",204
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Furthermore, this ask may affect human wellbeing in the UK. Specifically, there has been concern that this ask could cause an increase in food prices (Wilkinson 2020). If a price increase does occur - although we believe such an increase to be unlikely - disadvantaged socio-economic groups would likely be most drastically harmed (Kehlbacher et al. 2016).","text",205
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Including other cause areas in the ask","text",206
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","When campaigning for this ask, it is also possible to include improvements to causes other than animal welfare. In other words, this ask could also include a restriction on imports that do not meet the UK's standards for environmental sustainability, social justice, food safety, and other cause areas. Debates in Parliament about this ask have generally considered multiple cause areas, not just animal welfare (e.g. UK Parliament 2021b). This may improve public support but may also make this ask more difficult for the government to accept, and more difficult to defend at the WTO.","text",207
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Small-animal replacement problem","text",208
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","The small-animal replacement problem (SARP) is a known concern within many policies that change the prices of meat (Mathur 2022; Springlea 2022). When the price of meat increases, consumers may reduce their consumption of expensive meat (e.g., meat from cows and sheep) and increase their consumption of cheaper meat (e.g., meat from chickens and fish). This is particularly concerning given that chickens and fish tend to be farmed under conditions more harmful for their welfare than cows and sheep (Charity Entrepreneurship 2018; Animal Charity Evaluators 2020). The result is that the total number of animals consumed, and the overall amount of animal suffering, may increase (Mathur 2022; Springlea 2022).","text",209
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","While Cox (2020) concluded that the SARP is unlikely to be an issue with this ask, there have been concerns that this ask could cause the price of food to increase (Wilkinson 2020). A price increase would indicate that this ask has a chance of causing the SARP. However, we have seen no formal analysis on the effect of this ask on food prices or on the relative consumption of different types of meat. Also, we expect that the price of chicken would increase by a higher proportion than the price of beef, which would move consumption in the opposite direction of the SARP - in other words, consuming fewer animals. Given the scarcity of evidence that this ask may cause the SARP, and the fact that this ask has large, positive effects on animal welfare, we do not believe that the SARP is a major concern for this ask.","text",210
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","CONCLUSION","text",211
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Given the evidence documented in this report, we believe that requiring imports to meet UK animal welfare standards is very likely to positively impact the lives of many animals. We recommend that UK organisations consider campaigning for this ask.","text",212
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","The biggest remaining uncertainty is what proportion of imports would be affected. This, in turn, determines how many animals' lives would be improved. Nevertheless, in the scenarios we modelled, it appears that the number of animals affected is sufficiently high for this ask to be a priority.","text",213
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","We believe that further effort for this ask should focus on securing commitments from parties in their manifestos for  the upcoming general election, collaborating with the farming community, and possibly building support among Conservative MPs. For the first of these avenues, there is a window of opportunity now (at the time of writing, mid-2022).  Corporate campaigns may offer a further avenue to achieve this ask.","text",214
"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards","Most of the impact appears to come from processed chicken meat imported from Thailand and, to a lesser extent, Brazil. An organisation campaigning for this ask could focus awareness on conditions in those countries.  We are most enthusiastic about a total ban on lower-welfare imports. However, preferential tariffs for higher-welfare imports may be a useful alternative, and a multilateral agreement on animal welfare may also be worth exploring.","text",215

"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Whilst working with Animal Equality UK on their Ask Prioritisation, we saw an avenue for further exploration and prioritisation of asks within the wider UK context. We want our research to be as useful to as many groups as possible and as such, decided to run a simultaneous research process for the full UK context outside of the limitations of Animal Equality UK’s scope. We contacted all major animal advocacy organisations in this region and they were keen to understand the results of this UK-wide scoping following our research. We would like to thank the experts we looked to for guidance in this report. We recommend that any organisations wishing to work on this issue to get in touch with both ourselves and with Advocates for Animals, a UK-based law firm who have extensive knowledge on this matter.","text",11

"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","This is a summary research report by Animal Ask on behalf of UK animal advocacy organisations, investigating whether establishing a welfare-based Code of Practice for Scottish salmon could be a recommended intervention for improving the welfare of salmon in the UK.","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","The lack of an official Code of Practice for farmed fish in the UK is a glaring omission: they are one of the few farmed animals in the UK that does not have one. The implementation of an official Code of Practice is especially important given their high population and the extreme neglect of their welfare by present unofficial industry standards. They suffer from a host of welfare issues, of which the most significant are sea lice, sea lice treatments, cleaner fish welfare, and slaughter. It appears clear that the industry is failing to regulate itself.","text",14
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Moreover, there appears to be fertile ground for work on the subject since there is an ongoing review of the regulation of the Scottish aquaculture industry, pushed by the Scottish Green Party who have goals to more radically reform the industry. Though so far the discussion of the review has centred around impact on humans and the environment, politicians could be receptive to the inclusion of animal welfare in the reconstruction of industry regulation.","text",15
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Despite these points in favour, there are also some considerations against working on this ask. These include that virtually all salmon farms are currently signed up to the Code of Good Practice - which, though vague and inadequate, does offer some minimal protection - while 70% of farms are signed up to RSPCA standards. For an official code to be most impactful, it would have to exceed these standards. While there is room to do so, even for the higher RSPCA standards, it may be difficult to get a code with higher standards passed. Nevertheless, a new Code of Practice could still be impactful if it covered for specific weaknesses in these unofficial codes, if it increased enforcement of these regulations, or if it served as a first step to enable stronger legislative tasks in the future.","text",16
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Overall, we consider this a strong ask and recommend it to UK organisations. To be most effective, work must be started before the review is completed.","text",17

"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","This intervention would see a campaign directed at the Scottish government to provide a coherent regulatory framework for salmon aquaculture.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Regulation of aquaculture in Scotland is split across several different bodies, each with their own focus. The Fish Health Inspectorate (FHI), an agency of Marine Scotland Science, is responsible for ensuring fish health, such as by inspecting salmon farms to evaluate sea lice burdens, mortality rates, and disease (“Fish Health Inspectorate” 2014). Another body, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) is responsible for monitoring and assessing the environmental impact of the farms.","text",23
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","From a fish welfare perspective, the FHI is the most relevant body. They use a risk-based approach to monitoring, meaning that sites with higher risk are inspected more frequently. Inspections range from once a year to at least once every three years (Kenyon and Davies 2018). The majority of the FHI’s work is carried out under the following legislation (FHI n.d.):","text",24

"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","The argument for the campaign is that, as provided by the Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Act 2007, the Scottish Government has the power to create an official Code of Practice for the salmon industry. This would clarify how Scottish animal welfare law should be complied with by the industry. However, the Scottish Government has not chosen to create an official Code of Practice, other than a short Code dealing only with marine mammal interactions. The case for the campaign would be that this amounts to self-regulation by the industry, which should not be expected to ensure necessary welfare outcomes, and indeed has not.","text",36
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","An official Code of Practice works to explain how the industry can comply with the law. For example, theCode of Practice for the Welfare of Pigsadvises how pig farmers can comply with legislation - principally the ‘Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007’and the ‘Mutilations (Permitted Procedures) (England) Regulations 2007’in that particular case the current situation for Scottish salmon is that, unlike for other farmed animals, there is no official code concerning their welfare. This means that vague legislative protections create ambiguity and the industry is unaware what it has to do to comply with the law. It may also lead people to treat the codes as voluntary rather than as binding regulations. This may lead producers to be lax in their compliance with the industry code, something that undercover footage has indicated is the case (Animal Equality 2021).","text",37

"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Sea lice are parasites that feed on the skin, scales, tissues, and mucous layer of salmon. This reduces the host's appetite and growth, increases stress (Bowers et al. 2000; Ross et al. 2000), and causes external wounds. All of these factors reduce the vitality of the salmon, making them more vulnerable to infections and disease (Abolofia, Asche, and Wilen 2017). Therefore, although sea lice themselves are unlikely to directly cause the death of the fish, they compromise its immune function, potentially indirectly leading to its death. The more severe the sea lice infestation, the greater the compromise in the function and welfare of the host - ultimately leading to higher mortality rates (Vollset 2019; Morton 2005). These consequences can be sufficiently extreme that moderate to severe sea lice infestations would probably factor as the dominant cause of suffering in those salmon afflicted and sufficient to make their lives not worth living.","text",44
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Reporting shows that sea lice levels on Scottish farms are often high. A report by OneKind in 2017 found that sea lice trigger levels (an average of 3 female lice per salmon at the time the report was published) were breached on more than 500 occasions in that year (OneKind 2017). Between 2018 and 2019, the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation’s (SSPO) monthly averages suggest that the average adult female sea lice count per fish increased by 96% (CIWF and OneKind 2021). However, in 2020 the SSPO reported that the number of sea lice affecting farmed salmon was at its lowest level in seven years (RSPCA n.d.). Figures from September 2020 show that out of 211 seawater sites in Scotland (with 59 lying fallow), 23 of them experienced a sea lice problem that required treatment (either 1 or 0.5 female lice per fish, depending on the time of year). This is 15% of farms (RSPCA n.d.). Overall, year to year there seems to be huge fluctuations in the number of sea lice.","text",45

"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","To remove sea lice from salmon, farms use a few different treatments that can compromise welfare. While cleaner fish are also commonly used, these will be covered in a different section. One common method of sea lice removal is the thermolicer, a heat-based treatment⁶. This machine pumps salmon through a system that exposes them to 30-34C water, removing the lice. The process lasts about 30 seconds before the salmon are pumped back into their pens (SSPO n.d.). Other than the thermolicer, other treatments include the Optilicer (thermal) and Hydrolicer (mechanical). From information reported by Scottish farms about sea lice and the treatments used, we can establish that between 29/03/2021 and the date of writing this (28/05/2021), 34 mitigation measures were put in place to deal with sea lice. Of these, nine involved the use of a physical treatment (usually reported as the hydrolicer, although it is not clear if some of these were also thermolicers). This implies that roughly a quarter of responses to sea lice involve physical/thermal treatments. The rest of the measures were reported as bath only (6), bath and harvesting (3), cleaner fish only (6), cleaner fish and harvesting (3), or harvesting only (7) (FHI 2021).","text",61

"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","One solution proposed to reduce the impact of escaped farmed salmon on wild populations is to use triploid fish. These are fish that have an extra set of chromosomes, achieved by applying a heat or pressure shock on newly fertilised eggs. This means triploid fish are sterile and so cannot interbreed with the wild population. However, triploid salmon have been shown to have reduced welfare compared to normal diploid salmon. One study found that triploid salmon have an increased prevalence of spinal deformities (between 2-3% are deformed, compared to 0-1% of diploid salmon) (Fjelldal and Hansen 2010). Triploids are also more vulnerable to temperature stress, though they may also be less aggressive (Fraser et al. 2012). They can also have a higher mortality rate than diploids (Cotter et al. 2002; Benfey 2001). Therefore, even if it may serve to protect wild populations, it is important for overall welfare that triploid fish are not used in salmon farming.","text",120

The interaction between stocking density and welfare is a complex one since stocking density can have knock-on effects on other parameters, such as water quality and spread of disease. One study examined welfare indicators in Atlantic salmon in cages on a commercial marine farm, at densities ranging from 9.7 to 34 kg/m3. The authors found that stocking density did not affect welfare up to an inflection point of 22 kg/m3, at which point welfare then began to deteriorate (Turnbull et al. 2005). Another study examined salmon welfare at 15, 25, and 35 kg/m3.

This includes dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, pH, turbidity, salinity, hardness, and temperature. While each of these parameters has some importance for the welfare of the fish, dissolved oxygen is generally considered the most important.

Some issues can block or reduce proper exchange, such as biofouling (Gansel, McClimans, and Myrhaug 2010) or when the cages are arranged closer together in a suboptimal pattern. There have been attempts to directly improve the quality of the water in cages, most notably with dissolved oxygen (Berillis et al. 2016). However, water quality is generally less of a problem in cages, though also much more difficult to control.

Caution is required in considering these findings in the Scottish salmon context. Practices may differ between Scotland and Germany, while separate studies on the efficacy of percussive studies for carp and salmon indicate carp may be more difficult to stun than salmon (Lambooija et al. 2010; Robb et al. 2000; Lambooij et al. 2007).

"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Salmon are carnivorous. The composition of their diet varies throughout their life stages, with younger freshwater salmon eating more insects while adult salmon subsist on other marine animals. In aquaculture, salmon feed is carefully formulated for each life stage by varying protein, lipid, and nutrient content (“FAO: Feed Production” n.d.). This provides the salmon with the nutrients they need to grow and develop into the next stage. The ingredient composition used to achieve these goals has changed in recent decades. One recent study has produced estimates of the ingredients used in salmon feed in Norway (Aas, Ytrestøyl, and Åsgård 2019). In the figure below you can see the general trend, with the percentage of marine oil and protein sources reducing dramatically over the past 30 years. Although this data is from Norwegian salmon farms we expect this to generalise to the Scottish context.","text",242

"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","The main benefit of this reduction in the use of marine ingredients in salmon feed is the lower demand for other, mostly wild-caught, fish. The most straightforward benefit this has to wild fish is sparing them the experience of capture and slaughter. As there are no protections for wild-caught fish, this is usually a very stressful process culminating in death by asphyxiation - a process that can take more than 30 minutes for some species. This is likely to be one of the worst ways to die as a fish. However, it is important to consider the counterfactual cause of death for the fish if they had not been caught. They could die of starvation, disease, or predation, all of which are unpleasant ways to die. Beyond this effect, there are additional considerations about the effect of fishing on wild populations. If the industry is overfishing, reducing demand for wild-caught fish could increase wild fish populations. The quality of a wild fish’s life, as well as the effect of this population change on the rest of the food chain, could dramatically change the positive or negative direction of this effect, without even considering any other ethical considerations beyond utilitarianism. This means that modelling the benefit of reducing marine ingredient use to wild fish populations is complicated and something we can’t achieve in the short review here.","text",245
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","The effect of reducing the percentage of marine ingredients on the welfare of salmon themselves is neutral or slightly negative. If managed properly, the growth of the salmon will be unaffected. However, if too little is used this could be detrimental for productivity, and more importantly the health and welfare of the fish. Some compositions can cause differences in growth rates even at higher percentages of fish meal. Bransden et al. (2001) compared the effect of replacing some of the fishmeal in their diet with dehulled lupin meal (LPN), hydrolysed poultry feather meal (FTH), or a mix of both for salmon. All feed mixes had fishmeal contents above 30%. They found that the highest weight gain was achieved on the mixed or conventional fish meal diet. Importantly for the welfare of the salmon, they found no difference in immune function between the diets (Bransden, Carter, and Nowak 2001). Pratoomyot et al. (2010) examined four diets consisting of gradually lower fish meal contents at lower marine ingredient usages closer to what we currently see used in Norway and likely in Scottish salmon aquaculture. In the study, they replaced fish meal with plant protein in diets containing compositions of 25%, 18%, 11%, and 5% fish meal. They found that with each reduction in fish meal content, there was a reduction in the growth rate of the fish. The authors suggest this was due to the decreased palatability of these compositions to the salmon (Pratoomyot et al. 2010). However, at these lower levels it appears that supplementation with fish protein hydrolysate can offset the negative effects on growth - such as with 10% supplementation when reducing fish meal content from 35% to 5% (Egerton et al. 2020).","text",246
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Although this is not a full review, we can still see the general trend that a redcued fish meal percentage lowers growth rates unless the feed is carefully formulated or supplemented with other ingredients. This general trend makes it unlikely that the industry will remove too much fish meal for the welfare of the salmon since doing so also reduces productivity.","text",247

Closed containment systems can be on land or in water, but the basic concept is that fish are completely enclosed from the surrounding environment. This means that water quality and waste products can be managed using machinery.","text",260

"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Closed containment systems have certain significant welfare advantages over standard salmon farming. Sea lice and diseases would likely be drastically reduced in such systems. There is also no threat of predators and escapes are less likely to happen.","text",263
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","However, there are some serious concerns about the welfare implications of these systems. One of the biggest concerns is that, with a reduction in the potential for disease and an increase in control over water quality, farmers could increase their stocking densities. This would mean that salmon would suffer from an even greater reduction in living space and the likely stress and aggression that would accompany this. Existing certification schemes may mitigate this threat. Furthermore, closed containment systems require water to be continuously moving in one direction. This means that salmon that are ill cannot rest as they are pulled by the water movement. Another concern raised by Compassion in World Farming is that these systems will be completely reliant on the continuous operation of powered machinery and any backup systems. This means that any lapse in power supply, or human error, can have catastrophic consequences for the salmon. An example of this occurred in 2019 when 1.5 million juvenile salmon died at a hatchery⁹owned by Mowi Scotland Ltd because of a human error that resulted in the recirculation pump stopping (CIWF 2021). Still, this risk may be acceptable given the other benefits of the system.","text",264

"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Salmon and cleaner fish that are farmed in Scotland suffer many different welfare infringements, which paint a poor picture of welfare in the industry when put together. In particular, sea lice, sea lice treatments, cleaner fish welfare, and slaughter are notable areas of concern.","text",273
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Improvements to the welfare of Scottish farmed salmon and cleaner fish should be made as a matter of urgency.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Though we should be cautious in our interpretation of them, surveys generally suggest that the UK public wants more action on fish welfare. In general, our understanding of the polling data about the public’s concern for fish is that it is somewhat less than for other animals, but not dramatically less. It appears that most people think that fishes’ mental capacities, including capacity to feel pain, are significantly lower (Saulius Šimčikas 2020).","text",278
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","The most relevant data we found was a poll by YouGov and The Humane League. This found that ‘when presented with the facts’, only 28% of the public surveyed in the UK agreed that aquaculture can be relied upon to ensure fish welfare without a legal requirement to do so. Meanwhile, 71% agreed fish should have the same detailed legal requirements for slaughter as pigs, chickens, and cows (Daw 2021).","text",279
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Another highly relevant data point is that 76% of the UK public believes that fish should be protected to the same extent as other animals they eat (CIWF 2018). The strict implications of these statistics is that they suggest the public would be in favour of an official Code of Practice for farmed fish in the UK since there are Codes of Practice for land animals commonly farmed in the UK. However, people are unlikely to have thought through the full implications of their answers to survey questions so this data should not be taken at face value. Nevertheless, the polling process run by YouGov and The Humane League informed the participants about the industry beforehand, which represents significantly stronger evidence of their considered opinions.","text",280
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Including some data from Europe more broadly, 89% of people believe that humane slaughter is essential for good welfare, 79% of people believe that fish welfare should be better protected than it is now, and 73% of them also believe that fish feel pain (Waley et al. 2021).","text",281
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","These are all encouraging signs, but we are sceptical that people would act according to these stated opinions about protecting fish. We suspect that many individuals are far less willing to protect fish in practice. Fish welfare has consistently been a much more neglected issue than the welfare of other animals, which suggests it is a cause that people care less about in practice (FWI 2019).","text",282
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","There are also some surveys that are at odds with the data presented above. For example, a 2007 Eurobaromater poll found that only 8% of EU citizens thought that fish welfare needed to be improved (Banrie 2022).","text",283
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Public awareness and knowledge of aquaculture also appears to be low. Many people were surprised that the industry is as large as it is, such as that close to half of the fish they consumed were from aquaculture (Banrie 2022). This lack of awareness may mean that the issue is not emotionally salient to the public, even if in the abstract they say they support stronger protections.","text",284
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","European public concern for aquaculture centres more strongly around the sustainability and “naturalness” of the practice.

In September 2021, the Scottish government (The Scottish Government 2021) published a Code of Practice for Scottish aquaculture concerning fish escapes and marine mammal interactions. Fish escapes and marine mammal interactions certainly have welfare implications, but the welfare of fish is unlikely to be the main motivation behind this, and these would just be a small part of what a full official Code of Practice would address. Nevertheless, the fact that the Scottish government has already taken action in this area could lend a great deal of strength to a campaign to establish a broader Code of Practice for Scottish aquaculture.","text",302
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","An article by The Herald (Grant 2021) describes the motivations behind the Code of Practice. A government spokesperson quoted in the article describes their plans for actions on this issue, including introducing punishments for fish escapes. Intriguingly, the spokesperson also mentions that they want to take action on sea lice and Scottish aquaculture. As part of the agreement for the coalition, the government has pledged to strengthen controls on sea lice and to ban fishing and aquaculture from a protected area encompassing 10% of Scottish waters (Fish Farmer Magazine 2021).

Whilst  an  industry code  of  practice  exists,  which  is  largely follow ed  by the  industry,  it  is  important  that  any cases of  poor  farm  management  and unacceptable  environmental  impact  are  detected,  and  that  farm  managers,  and parent  companies,  are  held  accountable.

This suggests that this specific angle is neglected, even as the Scottish Government moves in a consonant direction that will bolster work on the subject.

"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","1) Salmon farming is a highly political issue due to the negative welfare of the animals, environmental concerns due to pollution, and the reliance on this industry for job security throughout Scotland.","text",329

With all of the intricacies involved in the decision-making, tackling the issue under a wide umbrella would likely have the greatest overall impact.","text",333

"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","This section summarises our cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), which weighs organisational costs against the welfare benefits of the ask. However, some parameters are subject to high uncertainty, and CEAs generally face a number of limitations (S. Šimčikas 2019; Holden 2016). The results of this CEA should be taken in light of these uncertainties and limitations.","text",335
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Modelling the effects of this ask is much more difficult compared to our other priority asks as there are several steps between a successful case and improvements in the industry. This means that while the maximum impact this ask could have is potentially very large, there are several points that could cause even a successful case to have little or no impact. This problem is compounded by the difficulty of estimating some of the effects this ask could have, such as building the groundwork for future legislative or enforcement campaigns which were not included in the CEA. It is important to note that these non-quantifiable effects may be very significant, and that cost-effectiveness models are necessarily limited by their inability to capture these effects. In light of this, the results of this cost-effectiveness analysis are very uncertain.","text",336
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","There are numerous potential benefits to this ask, but predicting exactly what will occur is difficult. An overarching campaign like this could lead to improvements on many aspects of the unofficial Code of Practice. In this CEA, we have modelled the expected effect of improvements occurring for sea lice numbers, sea lice treatment methods, reduction in the use of cleaner fish, reducing escapes, environmental enrichment, slaughter methods, stocking density, and water quality. Each of these could potentially significantly improve the quality of life for any fish who benefits from them. However, some elements are difficult or impossible to make improvements on compared to current industry practices. For example, in the case of sea lice, improvements are very difficult to make practically and treatments for the issue are themselves potentially detrimental for the welfare of the fish. The elements we would be most interested to see improvements on are cleaner fish, slaughter, and environmental enrichment. However, many of these issues would require a substantial change to the Code of Practice or additional research to support amendments, which are unlikely in the short-term.","text",337

"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","There are numerous existing Codes of Practice for other farmed animals including cattle, chickens, sheep, and pigs. These existing Codes of Practice were created a long time ago and have been edited and updated many times over the years. If the ask is successful, then the Scottish government may adopt the existing industry CoGP, create an official Code of Practice, or revise the existing  Code of Practice so that it covers fish welfare more comprehensively.","text",340
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","If a new Code was created, it would be opened up for consultation, as the recent limited Code was (The Scottish Government n.d.). This would allow various individuals and organisations to submit their views on the new Code, including seeking amendments and/or additions. In the past, views have been submitted by animal advocacy organisations, industry bodies, and universities (DEFRA n.d.). We have noted that many welfare issues are either not addressed, or only addressed using very vague language, in the industry’s CoGP. For example, words such as ‘adequate’ are used in places where specific, quantifiable guidance could be given based on available scientific evidence. This lack of specific guidance on welfare issues reduces the enforceability of the code. There may be some scope to improve this situation if the Government chose to create a new Code rather than adopt the industry CoGP verbatim. However, Code of Practices can only advise on how to adhere to existing regulations, so any improvements will be limited by the extent of the law.","text",341

"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","The best predictor of future enforcement and compliance with a new official Code of Practice is current compliance with other laws, certification schemes, and the current industry Code of Practice. However, given how vague a lot of the terminology is in the code and that the majority of the code is not official government guidance, most of the code is unenforceable without amendments.","text",343
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","The clearest example with a specific threshold and sufficient data to examine is the requirements surrounding sea lice. The industry Code of Practice advises lice treatment at between 0.5 and 1 adult female sea lice per fish depending on the time of year (Organisation 2016). This is lower than Marine Scotland's standard old requirement for farms to report any weekly sample that exceeds an average of two adult female sea lice per salmon and the mandate of immediate action if this exceeds six (Marine Scotland 2021). If farms fail to rectify the situation, an enforcement action will be taken. Sea lice data from Marine Scotland shows that monthly average sea lice levels exceeded six per fish 17 times, and two per fish 472 times, on farms between 2018 and 2020 (“Sea Lice Count Data 2018-2020 - Historical Sea Lice Data for Scottish Salmon Aquaculture 2010 - 2020” n.d., “Sea Lice Count Data - 2018-2020” n.d.). The requirements for reporting have changed since this data was collected, now ‘requir[ing] sea lice numbers to be reported weekly in arrears for all sites where fish are farmed’ and reasons must be given if no count is reported (Fish Health Inspectorate n.d.).","text",344
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Recent data shows that each time a farm exceeds an average of two sea lice per fish they report either intended or current mitigation methods in compliance with regulation (FHI 2021). It is worth noting that farms below this threshold and above the industry Code of Practice suggestions do not report any mitigation methods, possibly in violation of the Code of Practice. Even so, advisory notices were sent to three and five of the farms that exceeded the upper threshold of six sea lice per fish in 2020 and 2019 respectively. No advisory notices were sent in 2018 but 8 breaches were recorded which would require enforcement notices (“Fish Health Inspectorate: Sea Lice Information” n.d.). From the existing data for sea lice, we can see that most farms comply with government regulations and those that don't receive the appropriate disciplinary action. In regards to the industry Code of Practice, it is unclear whether farms attempt to comply with the lower threshold for action set by the industry Code of Practice.","text",345
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","We can see other indications of current compliance rates through undercover investigations. Each of these provides us with a case study of individual farms’ practices rather than a view of the full industry, but nevertheless provide some evidence of compliance rates. The two most prominent recent investigations are from Animal Equality (Animal Equality 2021), Compassion in World Farming and One Kind (Compassion in World Farming n.d.). In total, these investigations cover 22 farms and a slaughterhouse. On several farms, 'investigators found severe sea lice infestations and high levels of mortalities’ (Compassion in World Farming n.d.) and evidence of ‘animals suffering from prolonged pain’ was found in the slaughterhouse. However, neither of these are evidence of non-compliance with existing specific regulations and codes, though one could argue this amounts to unnecessary suffering. The investigation in the slaughterhouse actually shows the best-known slaughter method for salmon, percussive stunning followed by gill slitting, even if it was poorly executed in the footage they gathered.","text",346
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","The third avenue to investigate compliance rates is how well farms comply with other standards such as assurance schemes. This is also an important thing to consider as these schemes already exceed existing regulation and the CoGP in many areas. This means that compliance here will reduce the number of animals affected by an improvement in regulations. The RSPCA assurance scheme is the most widely subscribed to scheme in UK aquaculture, with around 70% of Scottish salmon certified (“What Is RSPCA Assured?” n.d.). The RSPCA provides statistics about their regular assessments of farms: ‘Of the 3,173 assessments completed in 2019, 44% had one or more non-compliances recorded. The vast majority of those were very minor, however 17 (0.5%) had severe animal welfare related non-compliances which resulted in immediate suspension from the scheme and subsequent investigation.’ (“RSPCA Assured Annual Review 2019” n.d.) The average number of infractions was 2.3 per assessment but, given that the RSPCA have 368 standards per species on average, this is a small proportion. CIWF and One Kind’s undercover investigation of salmon farms potentially demonstrated non-compliance with the RSPCA standards. However, the RSPCA initially suspended their assurance and reinstated it after subsequent investigation (Moore 2021b). Until now, these visits have been pre-arranged with the farm but after the recent investigations from CIWF, some figures from the SSPO are encouraging the RSPCA to make unannounced visits (Compassion in World Farming n.d.; Moore 2021a) .","text",347
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Overall, it seems that most of the industry tends to comply with the industry Code of Good Practice Although given the current code is made by the industry is very vague, proving non-compliance is difficult. Most farms are RSPCA-assured and their enforcement mechanisms through farm assessments and monitoring surpass what we would expect from government bodies. Of the remaining 30%, it seems that most farms tend to be compliant even if occasional infractions likely occur. Given the vague and weak protections the industry Code of Good Practise provides, this compliance does imply meaningful protection. Still, there is some weak evidence that an official Code of Practice would be complied with thus improving the quality of life of fish in aquaculture.","text",348

"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","In 2019, Scotland produced 7,405 tonnes of rainbow trout. It is challenging to calculate how many individuals this represents, since this depends on the average harvest weight of the trout. Figures show that the majority of trout harvested in Scotland weighed more than 900g but provide no more detail on average harvest weights (Scottish Government 2019). Another source tells us that rainbow trout are often harvested at between 1.5 and 5 kg (Seafish n.d.). Assuming an average harvest weight of 3kg, this would mean that approximately 2.5 million rainbow trout were raised that year. If we assume a lower average weight of 1.5kg, this would be 5 million individuals. Therefore, we can conclude that while worthy of significant consideration, the number of individual trout raised in Scotland is somewhere around 1:10 and 1:20 in relation to the number of salmon.","text",396

"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","The lack of an official Code of Practice covering Scottish salmon farming creates ambiguity around how salmon producers should comply with welfare law. Our review of welfare on Scottish salmon farms, alongside those of other animal advocacy organisations, shows that there are multiple serious welfare issues that are impacting salmon and cleaner fish. The current state of fish welfare in Scotland suggests that the Scottish Government must step in to improve standards. Creating a new official Code of Practice would be one step towards doing so. However, the fact that over 70% of Scottish salmon farms are accredited to the RSPCA or the Soil Association Organic standards - which often go beyond legal requirements - makes us more sceptical of the impact that an official Code of Practice might have for many of these problems. This concern is especially strong if the official Code of Practice were to contain a lot of vague or ineffectual guidance, as is currently the case with the industry CoGP. The case for a more comprehensive Code of Practice would be strongest if it is corrected for existing weaknesses in the CoGP, such as the lack of protections for cleaner fish or requirements for specific stocking densities.","text",398
"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon","Although there is likely a strong case for a more comprehensive Code of Practice in principle, the question remains of what improvements we would expect to see in the quality of life for Scottish salmon if this was successful. There are several areas of welfare that could potentially be improved if an official Code of Practice (or broader overhaul of regulations) were achieved. However, predicting which aspects of welfare would improve as a result of the establishment of an official Code of Practice is difficult. There are also harder to quantify long-term effects of an official Code of Practice that are important to consider, such as increased accountability for farmers, a more serious attitude towards fish welfare by the Scottish government, and opening up opportunities for future advocacy.","text",399

"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","The aim of animal protection legislation is to reduce the incidence of cruelty and improve the conditions that animals are raised in. To achieve this, it must deter potential offenders from committing violations. The most dominant and well-tested theory of offenders' behaviours in this regard is deterrence theory. With that said, there are a wide variety of other relevant theories, including strain, differential association, social bonding, and social learning(Pratt et al. 2006). Within deterrence theory, there are two methods of reducing crime, known as specific and general deterrence(Hodges 2015). Specific deterrence occurs when a punishment removes individuals who are more prone to committing offences from professions involving animals, either through incarceration or by removing the licences required to be employed in that industry. General deterrence aims to discourage other people from committing similar offences through a variety of methods.","text",11
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","Economists have primarily focused on general deterrence as this has the potential to have more overarching effects on crime rates. As such, they have modelled an individual's decision whether or not to commit a crime based on rational decision theory. This assumes that individuals will decide whether or not to commit a crime based on what maximises their utility(Becker 1974). Thus, crime occurs when the expected value of committing a crime exceeds the expected costs. Importantly, it is not the objective cost and benefits of a crime but rather an actor’s subjective perception of these that affects their decision-making(Paternoster and Simpson 2017)","text",12
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","This calculus applies to both individuals and firms as they will seek to maximise their utility and profit in a capitalist system. Under this model, we can only expect firms to pay the additional cost of complying with regulatory policy when they expect that non-compliance is likely to be detected and penalised(Hodges 2015). In fact, some have argued that this traditional model better fits corporate crime as offenders are less committed to offending than traditional criminals. These crimes are typically described as “calculated and deliberative and directed to economic gain”, making them a much better fit for rational decision theory(Paternoster and Simpson 2017).","text",13
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","Within these models, there are three main elements that act as general deterrents to individual crime: the likelihood that you will be caught for a crime, the severity of the criminal sanction, and how quickly the sanction is applied after the crime(Johnson 2019). An increase in any of these factors results in an increase in the expected cost of the crime and thus should lead to a reduction in the number of offences. The factor that is likely to have the greatest effect depends on the risk preference of the offender, with risk preference resulting in an equal percentage increase in the likelihood of being caught having a greater effect than the severity of punishment in risk preferring individuals, and the inverse for risk-averse ones(Becker 1974).","text",14

"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","One factor that could dramatically affect the ability of law enforcement to increase compliance with animal welfare regulations is the motivations of offenders. If crimes are more motivated by calculated economic gain, as Paternoster and Simpson argue in the corporate case(Paternoster and Simpson 2017), increasing the cost of non-compliance should have a larger effect. However, if most breaches of the animal welfare act occur due to negligence, ignorance, or are maliciously motivated, then other methods of enforcement should also be considered.","text",17
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","Existing evidence on motivations for animal cruelty is mixed. For animal cruelty perpetrated on an individual level, Kellert and Felthous (1985) identified some motivators for cruelty towards animals in convicted criminals. These included punitive training methods, punishment for undesirable behaviour, to satisfy a prejudice against a species, to instil violent tendencies in the animal, and displacement of hostility towards a human(Kellert and Felthous 1985). A similar study from Hensley et al (2005) found similar motivations in criminals, with the most common motivations for animal cruelty being anger, dislike, control or fear of the animal, or for fun(Hensley and Tallichet 2005). It is worth noting that these studies surveyed convicted criminals, who are likely to display more violent tendencies than the general population.","text",18
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","Research on the motivations for cruelty among farmworkers is rarer. The existing research associates reduced concern for welfare with a poor work environment(Inger Anneberg and Sandøe 2019), and cruelty to farm animals with the abuse of workers(Lovell 2016). Given this, more overarching risk factors for such cruelty could be controlled at the farm level by improving working conditions.","text",19
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","Overall, the motivations for individual acts of cruelty seem to be more emotionally or socially based rather than for economic gain. This, combined with the greater difficulty of detection, makes it unlikely that traditional deterrence theory would apply. In this case, greater screening of staff for risk factors, social programmes, improved working conditions, and training are more likely to have an effect. However, it is not clear how significant these would be.","text",20
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","The next distinct cause for broader breaches of animal welfare legislation specifically is neglect. Neglect does not occur from a motivation to cause harm to another being, or from some economic calculus of the cost and benefits of providing care as with other instances of non-compliance. Instead, neglect is most likely to occur when farmers are experiencing financial or social problems. In general, livestock farmers have a low risk of animal neglect problems. However, for those experiencing severe financial difficulties, divorce, or a psychiatric problem there is an increased risk of neglect of farm animals(Andrade and Anneberg 2014; Devitt et al. 2014; Kelly et al. 2011).","text",21
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","These problems can be caught with frequent inspections but penalties are less likely to change behaviour if the farmer is already distressed and not acting in their own best interests. This is particularly the case for financial difficulties and penalties where non-compliance may be caused by a lack of resources and thus fines will exacerbate the situation. In these instances, Overstreet and Anneberg suggest inspectors could instead provide additional support or guidance(K. O. A. Anneberg 2020). Although for instances of serious or chronic neglect, the previous use of lifetime bans from the industry(Stocks 2014; Duff 2010)seems appropriate as in these instances only specific deterrence is required.","text",22
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","Farmers themselves report that one cause for breaches in cross-compliance inspections comes from farmers who lack an awareness of all existing legislation and management problems in daily practice. Many farmers viewed the inspections as unfair for this reason, as inspectors would focus on a ‘small’ infraction without accounting for the larger broader picture of husbandry on their farm, particularly when this resulted in a reduction in subsidies(Inger Anneberg, Vaarst, and Sørensen 2012). Although, given these are the self-reports, these claims may be subject to the social desirability bias.","text",23
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","The final motivation for non-compliance with animal welfare regulation is management decisions to break with legislation motivated by economic factors. These have not been covered in the existing literature as these motivations are not observed in a more general population of criminals, while farms are unlikely to report being motivated by such self-interest.","text",24
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","Empirical evidence on preventing animal cruelty","text",25
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","In recent decades, numerous jurisdictions have increased sentencing for animal abuse(Morton, Hebart, and Whittaker 2018; UK Government 2021; Department of Agriculture and Rural Development 2016). These higher penalties are often driven by rhetoric that focuses on the need to ""get tough"" on people who abuse animals(Morton, Hebart, and Whittaker 2018). This rhetoric arises from the fact that, when increasing penalties for animal cruelty, legislators are usually driven by public perception(Whitehead 2017). Indeed, public perception was explicitly stated as the key motivation driving recent reforms in Northern Ireland(Department of Agriculture and Rural Development 2016).","text",26
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","However, this raises a crucial problem. Responding to community sentiment might please the public, but also means that the penalties are not actually designed to improve the lives of animals. As Morton et al(2018)explain: ""The desired outcome should not be to increase the duration or dollar value of a sentence; it should be to reduce animal cruelty through the most efficient type of penalty.""","text",27
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","Which combination of surveillance and/or penalties leads to the lowest rates of animal cruelty? Unfortunately, this question is impossible to answer with confidence. There is very little empirical evidence on the actual prevalence of animal abuse(Hughes and Lawson 2011). The best available data comes from on-farm inspections(e.g., Lomellini-Dereclenne et al. 2017; Väärikkälä, Hänninen, and Nevas 2019)or monitoring at slaughterhouses(e.g., Mullan, Stuijfzand, and Butterworth 2021). However, even this data does not allow the comparison of alternative surveillance or penalty regimes. As such, while many stakeholders assume that higher sentences translate to a lower prevalence of animal cruelty, there is no evidence to support this assumption. Higher sentences may also cause harm and perpetuate discrimination (see below, ""Enforcement and discrimination against humans"").","text",28
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","There have been calls for more frequent random inspections(e.g., Bennett et al. 2004). In a case study of French farms, Lomellini-Dereclenne et al.(2017)found that more frequent inspections seemed to improve compliance rates by a small amount. However, only 1% of farms are inspected each year in France (approximately the same as the UK). Only  23% of these farms improved compliance rates when re-inspected, suggesting the French inspection regime had little specific deterrence effect. Similarly, a study in the UK found that farms poor for broiler welfare tended to remain poor, despite those farms being targeted for follow-ups(Mullan, Stuijfzand, and Butterworth 2021). Additionally, a study in the US found that of companies that were given a warning for violating the Animal Welfare Act, 86.5% continued to violate that Act(Winders 2018). In that latter study, it was speculated that warnings were not a credible threat, since any subsequent penalties were very minor. Based on this evidence, regulations based primarily on inspections and warnings appear to have a limited effect on specific deterrence for farms that were inspected. However, this provides no evidence on the general deterrence effect of these inspections. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that increasing the rate of inspection improves overall compliance across all farms in a country.","text",29
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","Some evidence on the deterrence effect of inspections comes from a review of the comparative compliance rates of certified and uncertified farms in the UK(Clark et al. 2016). Certified farms are subject to annual or biannual inspections by the certification scheme (in addition to any inspections by the government). Farms may lose their certification if they repeatedly fail inspection. This enforcement regime does appear to be associated with greater legislative compliance(Clark et al. 2016). Affiliation with one certification scheme lowered the percentage of farms that were non-compliant from 23.1% for uncertified farms to 11.6% for certified farms. Membership was also associated with fewer instances of directly observable ‘unnecessarily’ suffering, with results of 4.6% vs 3.1% respectively. These figures drop further for each additional certification scheme, with 8.3% and 2.5% for two and three schemes showing a dose dependent relationship. However, it is unclear whether or to what extent the association is causal. This relationship may be explained by market forces or farmer ethos and management rather than the increased inspections.","text",30
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","It has been suggested that higher penalties may indeed prevent animal cruelty in the context of farming. Since farming is a commercial operation, it is plausible that economic motivations may play a key role in determining whether a farmer chooses to abuse animals. If this is the case, then harsher sentencing may indeed reduce the prevalence of animal cruelty on farms(Wolf, Bagaric, and Kotzmann 2021). However, this argument is weakened by the fact that economic motivations are only a small part of the picture (see, ""What motivates non-compliance with animal welfare regulations"").","text",31
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","Meanwhile, there have been calls for the education of farmers, building dialogues, and raising awareness of common problems(I. Anneberg, Vaarst, and Sandœ 2013; Lomellini-Dereclenne et al. 2017). A case study in Finland found that compliance with a particular problem (calf housing conditions) was unsatisfactory, despite a national education programme on this problem and clear wording in the legislation(Väärikkälä, Hänninen, and Nevas 2019). It is unclear whether this represents evidence against educational programs in general, or if this particular programme was poorly designed or implemented.","text",32
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","There have also been calls for other measures to prevent animal cruelty, including the rehabilitation of offenders, finding ways to increase the certainty that offenders will be caught, and more speculatively that digital health sensors to be worn by animals(Morton, Hebart, and Whittaker 2018; Manning, Power, and Cosby 2021). Calls for restorative justice have also been made in the literature on consistent anti-oppression(Kirts 2020). While restorative justice may be a beneficial policy for preventing re-offending, it may be less applicable to preventing the incidence of animal cruelty on farms that are not inspected.","text",33

"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","Although there is widespread agreement amongst economists, sociologists, psychologists, and criminologists that the criminal justice system has a general deterrent effect there is some disagreement as to whether marginal changes in policy have measurable deterrent effects.","text",36
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","This is particularly true for the severity of punishments where the results of a larger percentage of studies conflict with deterrence theory(Dölling et al. 2009). In addition these estimates tend to be weaker with the effects of severity, even when statistically significant, are too weak to be of substantive significance(Pratt et al. 2006). This is especially true for increases to already long sentences where there is little evidence of a marginal deterrence effect(Nagin 2013). The current position of the literature is best summarised by Tonry (2008) who concludes that no major economic literature on the effects of sanctioning changes has withstood scrutiny by social scientists or by other economists(Tonry 2008).","text",37
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","The relative importance of other factors on deterring crime has been investigated in a few reviews but tends to focus on the broad category of the independent variable; severity, probability or celerity. Within these reviews, authors tend to conclude that the probability of sanctions has the largest effect particularly for non-violent property crimes(“Deterrence in Criminal Justice: Evaluating Certainty vs. Severity of Punishment” 2016; Chalfin and McCrary 2017; Nagin 2013). Such crimes include theft, tax evasion, environmental offences or driving while drunk(Dölling et al. 2009). The general suggestion is that violent or more severe crimes are motivated by stronger emotions and are therefore less likely to be deterred by changing the rational benefits of crime. Thus depending on the type of offence, as discussed in on the motivations for cruelty or neglect, the literature would suggest a small to moderate effect of probability-based deterrence of crime rates.","text",38
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","The most extensive review of the specific factors that have the greatest deterrence effect in the existing literature is from Dölling et al (2009). They conducted a meta-analysis of 700 previous studies which estimated the deterrence effects of various parameters on crime(Dölling et al. 2009). Complete or partial agreement with deterrence theory was found in 70% of studies based on criminal statistics in whereas survey-based or death penalty studies were more likely to have weaker agreement or rejection of the hypothesis.","text",39
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","Dölling et al. (2009) corroborate the broad results of other reviews, finding that the likelihood of punishment seems to exercise a greater deterrent effect than the severity of the punishment, regardless of the type of data used(Dölling et al. 2009). Most notably, within the studies that used criminal statistics, the variables that had the most significant effects were the ratio of convictions to reported crimes, arrested persons per crime, and ratio of convicted persons to suspects. However  for survey-based studies, which used self-reported delinquency as a dependent variable, the effects sizes were smaller. The most significant effects in these studies came from the ‘expected probability of an informal sanction by friends/family’, ‘expected probability of a sanction by the criminal justice system’, and ‘assessment of the risk of discovery by the police’. Both forms of evidence suggest that detection of non-compliance and then subsequent sanctions are the most important aspect of deterrence.","text",40

"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","The best empirical evidence on corporate deterrence comes from the systematic literature review and meta-analysis performed by Schell-Busey et al.(2016). In that study, the authors reviewed the evidence for three single-strategy treatments for deterring corporate crime: law (e.g., characteristics of legislation), punitive sanctions (e.g., higher penalties), and regulatory policy (e.g., inspections). Only regulatory policy had sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a deterrent effect, and the deterrence was only detected at the company level (not the individual level). There was also evidence of a deterrent effect from combining multiple treatments, such as combining inspections with punitive sanctions. This evidence was also observed at both the company level and the individual level.","text",42
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","The studies used for that meta-analysis came from diverse areas that included environmental protection, immigration hiring, anti-competition, and consumer protection. Intuitively, these areas seem somewhat analogous to animal welfare, so we believe that it is reasonable to extrapolate the inferences from this study to animal welfare enforcement (at least in the absence of evidence specific to animal welfare). However, there are two key reasons to be cautious in extrapolating these inferences. The definition of corporate crime used in the meta-analysis included all levels of employees and a diverse range of behaviours, though only crimes committed to benefit the corporation were included. In other words, these crimes are calculated risks performed by corporations acting with profits and costs in mind(Paternoster and Simpson 2017). Merely benefiting an individual employee was not counted as corporate crime. Secondly, as was expressed in one of our expert interviews, animal crime is extremely niche, and comparing animal crime to other areas of crime is inherently problematic. As such, we believe that it is only reasonable to extrapolate these findings to animal welfare non-compliances that benefit agricultural companies. We will not extrapolate these findings to non-compliances that result from individual employee motivations (particularly social or emotional problems), which appear to be common (see below, ""Why do people abuse or neglect animals?""). That said, the risk of individuals abusing animals for their own reasons may be increased by corporate crime, such as with worker abuse.","text",43
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","This evidence provides support for enforcing animal welfare law via regulatory policy, such as inspections, particularly when those inspections have an educational component. The evidence also suggests that regulatory policy may be more effective if combined with other treatments, such as punitive sanctions. As noted, these inferences are only justified for instances of animal welfare non-compliance that benefit a company and not necessarily non-compliances for individual reasons.","text",44

"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","Another analogous area to enforcement of animal welfare laws is environmental law enforcement. Environmental law covers areas such as pollution, fracking, flooding, and noise pollution(“Law and Your Environment - Home” n.d.). Typical sanctions and enforcement mechanisms progress in a similar manner to animal welfare violations, including monitoring potential violators and providing progressive enforcement actions from advice and guidance to prosecution(“Environment Agency Enforcement and Sanctions Policy” n.d.). One benefit empirical research into environmental law enforcement has over animal welfare is that the aggregate outcomes of improved enforcement are measured through improvements in environmental indicators.","text",46
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","Existing reviews have assessed both the broad approach taken to environmental enforcement, either cooperative or deterrence-based, and more granularly the relative impacts of different monitoring and enforcement tools.","text",47
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","Thus far there is wider agreement between researchers on the best broad approach to enforcement, even in different contexts. In a review of the US environmental enforcement system, Rechtschaffen (1998) discussed a call to reform the system towards a more cooperative approach under the assumption that all firms were inherently motivated to comply(Rechtschaffen 1997). However, Rechtschaffen concluded from the available literature that the credible threat of meaningful enforcement provided by deterrence-based enforcement was essential to promote widespread voluntary compliance. Notable benefits of deterrence-based enforcement over cooperative approaches include more consistent treatment and less agency capture (see below, ""Effects on the future of the movement (regulatory capture)"". However, Rechtschaffen suggests that overall, an improved solution would be to integrate some of the most constructive features of a cooperative model within a deterrence-based system. Gunningham (2017) corroborates this conclusion, noting that the best results come from strategies which employ a judicious blend of persuasion and coercion, with the mix being adjusted to the particular circumstances and motivations of the entity that regulators are dealing with(Paddock, Markell, and Bryner 2017).","text",48
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","Reviews on the relative effectiveness of different monitoring and enforcement tools are less conclusive. Cohen (2000) examined 11 studies evaluating the effect of methods used for environmental deterrence on various compliance and environmental outcomes(Cohen 2000). Industries included oil tankers, paper mills, and steel mills. Overall, these found that broad deterrence effects could be observed across industries for monitoring, inspections, and number of enforcement actions. However, there was no strong evidence for which of these was most significant. Gray (2011) found similar results in a U.S. regulatory settings(Gray and Shimshack 2011), concluding that monitoring and enforcement actions resulted in substantial specific and general deterrence, as well as significant reductions in emissions. However, when discussing the relative impacts of different regulatory tools Gray notes that ‘the literature suggests that the relative impacts of different monitoring and enforcement tools vary across pollution media, industrial context, and time period’.","text",49
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","Summary","text",50
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","The direct evidence on the most effective ways to enforce animal welfare laws is sparse as the area seems to have been neglected by both animal welfare specialists and those focused on regulatory compliance. Therefore, any recommendations for reducing non-compliance from the literature must be made from drawing inferences from other similar areas in criminal, corporate, or environmental law compliance. Within this, we see that non-compliance with animal protection regulations occurs for a wider variety of reasons on an individual and business level. The first is for individual instances of animal cruelty which occur more to due to negligence or strong emotions. For crimes motivated for similar reasons in the criminal deterrence literatures the effect sizes of all methods of deterrence tends to be small. This means some instances of individual cruelty are difficult to deter with marginal increases in enforcement. Instead, changes to broader social norms or improving working conditions are likely to have larger effects.","text",51
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","Fortunately, broader instances of non-compliance caused by neglect or management decisions are more significantly affected by the available enforcement mechanisms. There is general agreement from the criminal and corporate compliance research that increasing the likelihood of being caught has the largest effect on crime rates. This is particularly relevant in the corporate case where regulatory policy, such as inspections, were most effective in ensuring compliance. However, evidence from environmental law enforcement is more mixed with the most effective tool varying depending on the context. Generalising from this available literature to the animal setting, this relates most to the cause of non-compliance. Smaller farmers who are more likely to be in non-compliance due to ignorance or negligence may benefit more from a cooperative approach, while larger ‘rational’ firms may require a deterrence-based model to bring them into compliance. However, even then the most impactful enforcement mechanisms to improve on the margin is difficult to conclude from the existing evidence in environmental enforcement.","text",52
"https://www.animalask.org/post/review-evidence-for-the-theory-of-change-of-a-policy","Although the evidence is generally weak for animal welfare enforcement, and to some extent for the enforcement of other crimes, the existing evidence suggests that monitoring and inspections are the most effective tool for increasing regulatory compliance. These are followed by the average number of enforcement actions taken against non-compliant firms which is itself affected by the rate of detection.","text",53
