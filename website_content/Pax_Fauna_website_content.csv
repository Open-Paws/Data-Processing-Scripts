"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","In this article, I explain how the narrative of ""welfarism vs. abolitionism"" missed the mark and created unnecessary conflict among animal advocates. In thesecond part, I’ll show how, by switching to the vocabulary of ""inside game/outside game"", animal advocates can shift from infighting to collaboration. The Gist An Innocent Question When I was in college, around 2016, my campus animal rights club hosted a talk by the local representative of The Humane League1Throughout this post, I’ll talk about THL as a stand-in for many organizations that pursue similar goals, mostly because of my personal experience with them.(THL). As she stood facing about two dozen college students interested in animal activism, she began her talk with a question: “What goal should animal activists pursue?” After several seconds of silence, I threw out an answer that reflected my background as an organizer with Direct Action Everywhere (DxE for short). DxE had a notorious flair for dramatic confrontations with the public, using disruptive protest to demand a complete dismantling of the legal systems abetting the exploitation of other animals for the benefit of humans. My answer, one of DxE’s slogans, was shorthand for that: “Total animal liberation.” The THL rep (I’ll call her Kristy since I haven’t asked permission to use her name) endured an awkward silence waiting to see if anyone else would respond. Kristy had been working for THL about as long as I’d been organizing with DxE. Her job was to mobilize volunteers to support THL’s signature tactics: handing out leaflets to the public about meatless diets, and pressuring corporations like Mcdonald's to set animal welfare standards for their supply chains.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","When she clicked to the next slide, the answer waiting there was, like mine, a reflection of her organization’s ethos: “Reduce the greatest amount of suffering for the greatest number of animals we can.” Them’s Fightin’ Words For an outsider to the world of animal advocacy, these two answers would probably seem perfectly compatible. Yet from the moment they were spoken, room 217 of the Hellems Arts & Sciences building was filled with a palpable tension. A conflict much larger than us had asserted itself.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","The humans that make up both THL and DxE share the extremely uncommon view that farming animals is a grievous moral harm, and the even less common conviction to dedicate their lives to opposing it. Yet back in 2016, this didn’t seem to be worth much. The relationship between the organizations was racked with mutual distrust, even disdain. And this malaise was merely a microcosm for a larger conflict among animal advocates, one that had been playing out for years in vicious comment threads across social media. To at least one side, this was known as the battle ofwelfaristsvs.abolitionists. In a moment, I’ll explain why I hope this dichotomy will finally be relegated to the dustbin of history. In fact, I believe it was as useless and misleading back then as it is now. But that’s not what I thought at the time. As soon as Kristy’s answer appeared on the screen, a familiar narrative was racing through my brain. I had labeled her awelfarist,and as fast as my neurons could fire, this label was joined by a series of harsh judgments. Kristy, I decided, was a sellout who lacked either a strong commitment to creating real change for animals or the imagination to believe it was possible, or both. She must be small-minded, I immediately concluded, if she’s willing to settle for asking corporations to make such tiny changes to thewaythey torture and exploit animals, rather than demanding an end to that exploitation. I feel pretty confident that something similar was happening for Kristy. In her view, I was a hopeless naïf, someone more concerned with doing activism that made me feel good than with actually making a difference in the lives of animals. By insisting that animal advocates set our sights on the unattainable, I and my ilk were damaging our ability to make any difference whatsoever, and driving the public further away in the process. Like others before me, I would soon realize that my goals were futile.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","At that point, I would either come around to her side or burn out and stop advocating for animals altogether.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","I wish I could say otherwise, but I never developed a successful collaborative relationship with Kristy after that. For the next few years, we managed to steer clear of each other as we each worked in the same metro area to organize volunteers toward different goals. Looking back, this was a stupid waste. Our efforts could have synchronized to be greater than their sum; instead, our mutual disregard ensured they were less than. My purpose for this blog is to explain what I wish both Kristy and I had understood differently at the time, and how I believe that understanding can pave the way to a renaissance of collaboration among animal advocates. Antispeciesister-Than-Thou If there was one person responsible for framing this debate as one of abolitionists vs. welfarists, his name was Gary Francione. You can guess which side he was on from the title of his book,The Abolitionist Approach.Indeed, for the law professor and vegan philosopher,welfaristwas a dirty word, one many of its targets never identified with (he sometimes deigned to call themregulationistsorincrementalists). Francione more concisely laid out the fault lines as he saw them in an essay titled “Irreconcilable Differences.” (Gotta hand it to him, the guy knows how to get his point across in a title.) Describing the welfarist view as “blatantly speciesist,” Francione rails against the strategy of pushing for incremental improvements in farmed animal welfare regulations, in which he sees a “symbiotic relationship” with the industry itself. Ultimately, he concludes that asking for anything less than veganism (for the individual) and total abolition (for society) sets us up for failure. When I was first getting involved in animal activism, I found Francione’s perspective appealing. His criticisms of welfare campaigning fit well with my own values, and he wrote about the basic questions of animal ethics with fierce clarity.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","I still cherish his animal rights philosophy, but I’ve come to see many points of his movement criticism that I don’t agree with. Specifically:","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","1. Welfaristsareabolitionists I had to contend with the plain fact that the humans working their butts off at organizations like THL are ethical vegans who long just as deeply as I do for an end to violence against animals. This reality came home for me when one of my best friends from college, Zoë Sigle (her real name this time) succeeded Kristy as the local grassroots director for THL. I’d known Zoë for years, and we’d grown into our activism together. I knew her to be a person not only of deep integrity and dedication, but also piercing intellect. It was impossible for me to write her off the way I had done with Kristy, who I didn’t otherwise know. (Not that that was any excuse.) Of course, Francione insists the intentions of “welfarists” don’t matter. So let’s look at their impact. 2. Welfare campaigns aren’t responsible for the humane myth The logic behind Francione’s accusation of a “symbiotic relationship” is that by pursuing incremental reforms, advocates are sending a message to the public that farming animals is a basically acceptable practice that just needs to be reformed: Groups… identify practices that are economically vulnerable, such as the gestation crate; industry resists; a drama ensues; industry eventually agrees to make what are meaningless and possibly even financially beneficial changes; the animal groups declare victory and fundraise; industry, praised by the groups, reassures the public that it really cares about animals. It makes sense that welfare campaigns might lead members of the public to think that farming animals is no problem after all. But is that actually what happens? It turns out, we don’t have to guess. Two research teams have recently investigated this exact question. Thefirst study(n=1,520), published this April, measured people’s opposition to animal farming (AFO) after being shown three different readings: one about current animal farming practices, one describing welfare reforms, and a control about an unrelated topic.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","The welfare group reported slightly lower AFO than the current practice group, butgreaterAFO than the control group.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","The differences were too small for statistical confidence, but to address Francione’s accusation, we only need to show that welfare reforms don’treduceAFO. The purpose of welfare reforms is not to change public opinion; we have other tactics for that, as long as they aren’t making it worse. (Another team led by Pax Fauna’s ownZoe Griffithsreached similar findings in a study soon to be published.) Now, it’s certainly true that thehumane mythis a key idea propping up the slaughter industry. But the available evidence suggests that welfare campaigns by animal advocates aren’t to blame. Indeed, meat corporations seemperfectly capable of spreading that liethemselves, even in countries with the fewest protections for farm animals. And inversely, when we look at countries with relatively higher protections (such as Germany, Sweden, and the UK) it appears they go hand-in-hand with stronger energy for animal-free foods and animal liberation activism.2I am not aware of anyone studying this rigorously, and it seems worthwhile. If it has been studied, I’d love to see it so please share!That is, higher welfare protections don’t seem to stifle abolitionist impulses in a society. 3. No strategy is without limitations The final thing that turned me off Francione’s argument was asking:well, what are you offering instead?Instead of welfare campaigns (and just about everything else) Francione believes we should all be focusing on vegan education: convincing people to embrace a vegan lifestyle, one-by-one or lecture-hall-by-lecture-hall. He used to point out that if every vegan in the UK would convert just one other person to veganism each year, the whole country would be converted in just 7 years. This is mathematically correct3If 1% are currently vegan, 1% x 27= 128%just as surely as it is not remotely happening (the number of vegans is growing very slowly ornot at all), and Francione offers no credible strategy to make it start happening.","text",12
"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","I don’t think that someone needs to have a solution to a problem in order to point one out. But it bothered me for Francione to spend so much time criticizing others when his own strategy was so full of holes. And ultimately, it led to a shift in my perspective.","text",13
"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","Everyone’s an Incrementalist Incrementalismis just another word for strategy, especially following on Paolo Freire’s definition inPedagogy of Hope: What can we do now in order to be able to do tomorrow what we are unable to do today? Unless you have a plan for how we’re all going to wake up tomorrow in a vegan world, you are an incrementalist. The thing that differentiates us is not the purity of our desire to end violence against animals; it is merely the incremental steps we are each focusing on to get there. Every animal advocate I know is in basic agreement about the world we’d like to see (at least insofar as it concerns humans’ relationship to other animals). We’re just focusing on different increments to get there: I’m guessing that if most people reading this were to isolate any one of the strategies listed above, we’d have a hard time seeing how that strategy alone can get us all the way from the world we have today to a radically different relationship to other animals. Fortunately, all of these strategies and more are being pursued in parallel in a diversemovement ecology. And if we play our cards right, each strategy can make up for the deficiencies of another. Alright, so now we can all hold hands and sing as we march towards a glorious vegan future, right? Kumbaya It probably isn’t a very controversial idea to say that the movement will need a diverse,multistrategicapproach to win real change for animals. But needing a variety of strategies doesn’t mean any one of them should be above criticism. The conflict that existed between DxE and THL back in my college days may have gotten out of hand, but it was based on real, substantive disagreements about strategy. It wouldn’t work to paper them over by throwing around terms likemultistrategicandmovement ecology. Rather, it is precisely by examining those disagreements up close that my own views changed.","text",14
"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","I have come to believe that the strategic disagreements between DxE and THL were based on fundamental misunderstandings because we each only saw things from our particular position in a complex movement. It has taken me years to realize, butthe different demands we were pursuing were a reflection of the different roles we were playing in the movementand the needs of those roles. This is something more subtle than the diverse incremental strategies listed above.","text",15
"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","Fortunately, DxE and THL each provide great case studies. No two strategies divided the movement more back in those days than the corporate cage-free campaigns pursued by groups like THL and the signature restaurant disruptions of DxE. In thesequel to this blog, I try to convince my skeptical 21-year-old self that there was a depth of wisdom to cage-free campaigns,andconvince Kristy of the same thing about DxE’s antics. I’ll recruit the help of a new, more collaborative frame for thinking about this old division in the movement:inside gameandoutside game. Read part 2 now. Get updates from Pax Fauna","text",16

"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","I mean, yah, of course. This dovetails with the juxtaposition of REFORM vs REVOLUTION. The best way to achieve meaningful reforms that matter and are impactful has always been through principled,  collective, organized, conscious activity guided by dedicated cadres of militants. History has been like this. How does one think the meaningful reforms of the 1930s  happened? Because the CIO happened. The CIO was made up of tens of thousands of militants who were organized, principled and dedicated. Not half-assed.I don’t condemn garbage like the Humane League or Francione because they advocate for reform or, as you say, “welfarism”. I condemn them squarely because they have no clue how to achieve it and be the first to fall in line with the oppressors of society, if enough pressure was put on them. The petty bourgeois have always been like this. How does one think fascism happened? That is to say, it is, as you describe, a false dichotomy. But the contempt still remains for those who don’t see the necessity of principled, militant, active organization.","text",19

"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","Hey Nav! It's good to hear from you. Would you be open to the framing that (for instance) THL don't reject the need for militant organization (militant in 21st century US not necessarily meaning armed, I assume we agree) but rather see that they're trying to fill a different role? I think this is the case for at least some at THL. Perhaps more importantly, as one person who gave feedback on this piece pointed out, they needn't necessarily agree with the need for militancy in order to effectively complement it. Do you see any role for the inside game?","text",22

"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","The “inside game” is a difficult thing for me to grasp, honestly. I see it as forced concessions that are earned by militant activity. Go too far inside and it has a kind of momentum unto-itself, that becomes corrupting to such an extent that it’s like crossing a kind of event horizon. The system controls everything in the eco system, and makes sure to bring seemingly at first  unwilling participants. Maybe it’s apples and oranges, though. I don’t know. I just see the example of the history of Social Democracy, the level of corruption that went on, the opportunities that were missed, the rubicons that were crossed. We see it, politically,  to borrow from politics, the Squad and AOC. That kind of “inside game” is totally corrupting-they are bought and paid for. They are terrified at even asking for lukewarm demands. I’m not saying form a fringe-out-of-the-loop “holier than thou” militant group (like, for example, ALF). THAT bends the stick  way too much the other direction. Into pissing into the wind. We need important legislation, we need important reforms, but they must be fought for in a principled way. When you totally set up an inside game, all kinds of concessions are possible. I’m not against, per se, groups that do play that game of legislation, etc. Or “Welfarists” as you say. let them do what they do. But I do know that, ultimately, these sort of reform groups that are not tied to principled, organized militancy will always ultimately see the militants as a group that is endangering their activity (because they have not only bought into the game, have adopted to the rules, and made all the concessions). That is something to be mindful. I’m not sure you galvanize 3.5% of the population for animal rights only. I do believe you can when we contextualize animal rights with the greater climate catastrophe. The recent flooding in CA demonstrates this, too.","text",25

"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","I fully agree that probably the most harmful tendency of inside-game groups is to see militants as threatening their incremental gains, rather than recognizing that militancy can make far more dramatic gains possible. Personally, I've also come to appreciate the importance of people who deeply understand the inner workings of dominant institutions, and have enough relational and positional capital inside those institutions to translate militancy into concrete, lasting wins. I've seen too many militant groups get duped, especially now that dominant powerholders have a much more effective playbook for disarming radical protests than they did in, say, the 60s.","text",28

"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","Thanks for this! I’ve gone through a similar process and it’s great to hear your views. I used to be a follower of Francione too. I asked him at a conference once what activism he recommends since he had bashed single issue campaign, meatless Mondays, etc. and he kept talking about a guy from Australia with vegan cupcakes and Animal Liberation pamphlets. The idea that resonated with me was this concept of “welfare abolitionism” the idea of working on welfare to get to abolition. I believe that term came from Matt Ball. I went from that extreme abolition approach to being a “sell out” working on welfare reforms 15 years later. I’ve been in the movement since 2005 and the best thing I learned was that I don’t know everything, and I’m going to make mistakes and change my mind along the way. No one has ever done what we are trying to do and none of us have all the answers. I'm all for embracing the multi-strategy approach. I may personally disagree or think someone's idea is ineffective or misguided, but I'm not going to publicly criticize it. That seems key to me, that we respect that someone else deeply cares about these issues like we do and sees a different way of going about things.","text",37

"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","Thanks for your comment, Katie. That Francione story is right on the mark! I could help but laugh. There's an unattributed quote I've often heard about a civil rights organizer in the 60s who was asked by a journalist about infighting. His only response was: ""In the movement, we're a family. Families fight, but we keep it in the family."" I actually think one reason our fights have spilled out into the public is that we don't have a good forum internally for holding these constructive debates. People have genuine criticism of each others strategies. I happen to believe a lot of these criticisms could be resolved through something resembling a well-structured debate, which in my view often leads to greater understanding by both sides. But without that, frustration builds up and ends up beings vented in more harmful ways.","text",40

"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","Hey Aidan - thanks for writing about this and sharing your thoughts. It's an interesting conversation for sure. I appreciate the way you describe your journey from a more judgmental posture to a more appreciative and collaborative one, and I think that's a valid lesson. I also appreciate that the ""great debate"" and conflict around this issue may not be super valuable to the movement more broadly. That said, I had a few thoughts while reading your post: 1. For the first portion of the article you present incrementalism as if it's the approach of welfarists, and then later you point out that everyone's an incrementalist. I wonder if the entire incrementalist conversation is really relevant to the welfare conversation? Because it seems to me that one can be an incrementalist abolitionist (e.g. plant-based procurement) just as one can be an absolutist welfarist (e.g. Joel Salatin). Even when getting into your second article, isn't it possible to play inside game with incremental abolitionism instead of welfarism as well? So I'm not sure that we technically need welfarism in order to play inside/outside ball. 2. You seem to be coming from a strategic framing here. I appreciate that, and I also notice that maybe that frame doesn't address where the critics are coming from. I suspect when critics talk about welfare they are sometimes coming from an ethical frame: What is the message we are sharing with others and is it an honest expression of our ethical values? Might it be important for us to hone our messages so we can be honest with ourselves as well as those around us, and thus maintain more integrity in our relationships? 3. Moving back to the strategic frame: if we're having a conversation about animal welfare, I'm concerned that we might be missing the opportunity to have another, more direct conversation about the roots of the problem. With limited firepower in our movement, I feel a burning need to economize.","text",43
"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","In particular, I suspect that the number of people who support total animal liberation is smaller than the number of people who support animal welfare reforms. It may be a loss to the movement if the people who believe in liberation and are willing to dedicate their lives to the cause instead spend their precious time on something that others could do.\\","text",44
"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","4. You wrote a section titled ""welfarists are abolitionists"". While I do see where you're coming from, I'm not sure that I agree. I think some welfarists are, and some probably aren't. I'm guessing the ones that you and I know personally mostly fall into the liberationist-in-disguise camp. But it also seems to me that there's a pretty significant amount of people working towards welfare who do not share the liberationist agenda. That doesn't mean we shouldn't ally with them when it supports our agenda, but we also might want to be careful that we don't conflate their agenda with ours. 5. I'm not sure that welfare does too well outside of the consumer frame. It seems that it's very easy for folks to fall into a defensive consumer posture ""I only eat humanely raised animals"" and welfare programs might reinforce this frame. If we want people to think about taking collective action to move towards a plant-based food system, I'm not sure how valuable the animal welfare conversation is as a part of that (but you've done the research - maybe you could tell me!)","text",45

"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","Hey Owen! I appreciate all your points. Reading them makes me think I probably oversimplified some of my points for narrative convenience. 1. Agreed, the incrementalism point is one way I'm trying to point out the underlying flaws in the abolitionist/welfarist frame. But you're right that there are people (like Salatin) who are genuine welfarists. It's possible I could have been more accurate by focusing on ""New Welfarists"" which is Francione's term for people he sees as insufficiently insistent on abolitionist messages. 2. The honesty point is a good one. I think it's a good conversation to have and all I'd have to say about it in relation to this piece is ""can we at least agree that on some level that is still a strategic disagreement?"" I think the principled view is about a belief that being consistent on principles like honesty will ultimately lead to a better outcome. So it's a strategic question that can be constructively debated rather than a moral question that poses an ""irreconcilable difference"" (Francione's term). 3. I don't necessarily disagree. As I see it, the basic argument is about whether welfare reforms are an effective incremental step toward abolition. Some think they're the best incremental strategy we have, others think they're pointless at best and counterproductive at worst. In the second article I examine these arguments. I'll just add that from our research, it's not clear the public makes such a distinction between welfare and the roots of the problem. They may go hand in hand. 4. Agreed, I oversimplified here. 5. I find this point wonderfully provocative. Using my own statements against me! But actually, I agree. I don't think welfare campaigns make for good public messaging. Welfare campaigns might be a good strategy to build institutional power, but not a good strategy to build narrative power and political power in the public sphere. Which is exactly how I'm hoping we reframe our conversations about movement ecology.","text",48

"https://paxfauna.org/welfarism-abolitionism-obsolete/","I have never understood the Francione anti-welfare stance. But equally, I am not especially immersed in the Animal Rights movement. That said, I DO have a view about this. I am a staunch supporter of the notion that ethical veganism is simply about preventing rights violations; clearly, I believe that other species deserve basic rights. But we humans have already worked out what basic rights actually are (at least in definitional terms). They are those at Articles 3-5 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The right to be free and not treated as property, the right to one's own life, and the right not to be treated cruelly. Even the Vegan Society's definition is essentially these three rights. So, now we know what to do. We don't buy products from animal-using industries because those industries violate the first two basic rights. If we were successful, there would be no such industries, so consequently there could not be any violations of the third right. However, animals are still being bred by those industries, and as animal advocates we should support and even agitate for best practice welfare in order to prevent violations of the animals' right not to be treated cruelly. But we are not going to buy products from animal-using industries, regardless of their welfare practices.

"https://paxfauna.org/where-the-animal-movement-will-be-reborn/","The Gist: Concentrate! Back when I was an organizer with Direct Action Everywhere, trying to figure out how to build a mass movement for animals, there were a few strategic puzzles that just kept coming up, year after year. One of the most persistent was the debate betweenconcentrationanddistribution. One possible strategy was to concentrate all of our energy inone place. We could carefully select a city where we had the best chance of establishing a historic precedent for animals, then encourage dedicated activists to move there, in the same way that the gay community concentrated in San Francisco, creating new norms of LGBT acceptance that slowly spread across the country. But we could also imagine benefits of a more distributed strategy. By investing in chapters all over the country, we could reach more people and engage more activists. Even if vegans are willing to uproot their lives and move to a new place, it might not be very strategic toremove people from the social networkswhere they can have the most influence. Being widely distributed would also enable us to seize opportunities wherever they might pop up: it’s impossible to guess where the next dramatic escape of an animal from a slaughterhouse will happen (a fantastic opportunity for a protest to seize the narrative) or where an unexpectedly sympathetic city council might take shape. This was the let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom strategy of SNCC, Martin Luther King, and other civil rights strategists in the 20th century, all of whom built deep networks of community organizing all across the American south. (This problem is specific to social movements in the United States and other countries with a large population spread out more-or-less evenly across a massive area.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/where-the-animal-movement-will-be-reborn/","For this reason, I was always jealous of movements like in the UK, where a whopping 14% of the population live in the London metro area and 87% within a four-hour train ride, allowing nearly everyone in the country to get to a major protest in London and still be home in time for dinner.)","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/where-the-animal-movement-will-be-reborn/","Well, I recently stumbled onto an answer to this old predicament: A solution that promises the best advantages of both concentration and distribution. It happened in a funny way. The Vortex At Pax Fauna (where, sure enough, I’m still trying to build a mass movement for animals) we work remotely, which has allowed me to move out of my house in Boulder and spend several months traveling, doing stints of house-sitting and couch-surfing in various cities across the country. Well, actually, I’ve been drawn to certain cities in particular: Boulder, Berkeley, Portland, Madison, Asheville, and Austin. When people ask me, I’ve struggled to name exactly why I feel drawn to spend time in each one, what it is that these cities seem to have in common besides being the sorts of places angry counter-protesters tell animal rights activists to “go back to.” I certainly have personal connections in each, but somehow it feels deeper. I’ll sometimes say something like, “There’s kind of a vortex between all these cities, right?” Right, it turns out. I was recently introduced to an amazingdata setpublished by Facebook, which measures the connectedness between every county in the United States. The Social Connectedness Index essentially measures the density of Facebook friendship connections between any two counties. We learned about it inChange,a book by social network researcher Damon Centola, who advises that it is a pretty good way of measuring real social connectedness at this point in time. So I decided to use this data to test my theory about the “inter-city vortex.” I grabbed the data for each of the counties I was interested in. It’s basically a spreadsheet listing every possible pair of counties, with a score for their relative connectedness. (With 3192 counties in the country, the file has over 10 million lines of data. It crashed Aidan’s computer. We had to call our friend Steven Rouk for help.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/where-the-animal-movement-will-be-reborn/","Thanks, Steven!) As one would expect, each county is most connected to itself, followed by neighboring counties, other counties in the same state, and often a few counties in neighboring states. This much isn’t new, of course. We know people who live near us.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/where-the-animal-movement-will-be-reborn/","But for many counties, when we look past those initial close geographical connections, we find county pairings start to pop up that aren’t geographically close at all. As I looked at the places I was most interested in, even though they’re literally spread all across the country, some of the same counties kept popping up. Some groups of counties are indeed highly connected to each other, forming different socio-cultural networks geographically dispersed throughout the US. And sure enough, one such network was that progressive clique I’d been trying to put my finger on. It included all of the places I’d originally hypothesized, as well as a few I wasn’t expecting. Snowball Fight But don’t worry, this piece is about more than just providing scientific validation for my travel plans, though that’s a nice plus. This network of cities is our answer to the problem of concentration vs. distribution. Changeis a book about how new norms spread through social networks. Or, more accurately, whysomenorms spread and others don’t. In it, Centola works out that the answer has much less to do with the norm itself (i.e. is it “viral” enough) and much more to do with the layout of the social network it is spreading through. In the simplest terms, whileinformationspreads through social networks like a virus, jumping quickly from person to person across networks,behavior changespreads very differently. Thesecomplex contagions(such as believing in animal rights or participating in a social movement) spread through tightly knit social clusters on the periphery of a network, building momentum at first by reaching critical mass in small, relatively isolated clusters. Centola calls this theSnowball Strategy(read all about ithere). So far, theSnowball Strategywould seem to be an argument in favor of social movements concentrating their efforts in one place. But there’s one more crucial step. A new norm starts by building momentum in social clusters on the periphery.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/where-the-animal-movement-will-be-reborn/","But how does it break out of that cluster and into the mainstream?","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/where-the-animal-movement-will-be-reborn/","Wide Bridges The answer, according to Centola, iswide bridges.Behavior change doesn’t spread easily. It has to overcome a lot of resistance. The reason these changes start in social clusters on the periphery is that these clusters are made up ofstrong ties- important personal connections involving a lot of trust and social influence.Weak ties,like acquaintances we meet at conferences or the dentist we see twice a year, aren’t powerful enough to spread new social norms. You’re probably not going to change fundamental beliefs or behavior just because your dentist tells you to, right? (Be honest: how often have you been flossing lately?) Well, it turns out this principle doesn’t just apply on the individual level. For a new norm to make the jump from one social cluster to another, the two clusters need to have a strong connection. And the way that social groups are strongly connected is throughwide bridges.Basically, two groups that have lots of connections between them share a wide bridge. At this level, the strength of the ties is less important than the number. Which finally brings us back, as you guessed, to our network of cities. The Social Connectedness Index shows that the following cities all share wide bridges with each other: (We show our work here.) Building an Animal Freedom Avalanche Simply put, what happens in Portland or Asheville matters more in Boulder than what happens in, say, Cleveland or Las Vegas, because of the wide social bridges between these cities. But why are we talking about this network of cities in particular? They share more than just wide bridges. These are all very liberal cities, and several are college towns with younger-than-average populations. Besides gender, thetwo strongest demographic variablespredicting greater support for animal rights are liberal politics and youth.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/where-the-animal-movement-will-be-reborn/","All of this points to a potential strategy for the animal rights movement: to invest our resources neither in one central location nor in complete dispersion, but instead in a carefully chosen network of cities throughout the country.The essential hypothesis is that efforts and changing norms in each of these cities would be mutually reinforcing.If a vegan in Boulder decides to join a protest, her influence makes it more likely that her friends in Berkeley and Asheville will decide to join a similar protest organized in their area. If the politics of animal freedom catch on among young people in Portland, they’ll spread it to their friends in Austin and Madison, reinforcing activists' message in those cities. (InChange,Centola documents several modern trends that spread in precisely this way, from the hashtag #blacklivesmatter to the original adoption of Twitter as a tool.)","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/where-the-animal-movement-will-be-reborn/","By focusing on just this handful of cities, we can effectively concentrate our resources while building a genuinely nationwide movement. If we can get animal rights to catch on in this peripheral network of hip, liberal cities, we’ll have anchors down in half a dozen states (including some solidly red states, Texas and North Carolina). From there, our snowball can build into an avalanche. What Now? We’re calling on any organization that runs local or area-based programs to join a conversation: what would it look like for many movement organizations to combine our efforts in a carefully chosen network of cities like this? Imagine what would be possible. Imagine the kind of flourishing movement we could create by giving it everything we’ve got in just the right places. University campaigns, vegan restaurant pop-ups, raucous anti-fur protests, ambitious ballot measures, and everything else you can think of all within a few square miles of each other. Surely, that’s what it looks like for animal freedom to become normalized. We’re not married to only these cities; for one thing, they’re whiter than the nation as a whole, and weighted towards blue states, which carries a risk of locking us in as a partisan issue. We just want to get the conversation started. If your org is involved in any strategies like this at the city level, comment here or reach out! Get updates from Pax Fauna","text",12

"https://paxfauna.org/where-the-animal-movement-will-be-reborn/","I love the data-based approach to combining geographic and psychographic targeting. My question is regarding the value of the wide bridge connections when we'e yet to establish norms in any of the locations. However, concentrating resources would be an exciting way to move toward creating norms in these areas. Geographic targeting could also allow for pilot testing campaigns or other initiatives in one location, fine-tuning, and then rolling out in other areas that would potentially respond in similar ways. While organizations might focus on the list of locales here, or even a subset, it should also be possible to engage individual advocates and smaller groups in locations with similar profiles and share lessons learned. While I'm not sure of the connections, places such as Cambridge, MA; Takoma Park, MD; and Arlington, VA have the strong liberal lean and some concentration of younger people (less in Takoma, which I don't think has any university). Looking forward to hearing more about where this goes.","text",15

I completely agree with your suggestion that using this (or another!) network of cities would only make sense after a successful pilot in one locale, that wide bridges won't do much for us until we're successfully changing norms, and that concentrating resources can help us do that. It's also definitely possible that similar networks could be uncovered between other cities, and it's well established that cities share wide bridges with those close to them geographically, too.

"https://paxfauna.org/introducing-pro-animal-futures-10-year-plan/","Charting a Course: Pro-Animal Future’s 10-Year Roadmap This post is intended to contextualize Pax Fauna andPro-Animal Future’scurrent work in relation to our past work and future plans by elaborating on the 10-year plan outlined in the graphic above. I’ll start with a word about what this is ultimately meant to achieve, though I’ll save a full discussion of our theory of change for another post. At present, Pax Fauna is focused on supportingPro-Animal Future, a social movement organization we incubated through our initial research phase. Pro-Animal Future is focused on systematically developinggrassroots ballot measure campaignsas an intervention in the farmed animal protection movement. Our goal is to perfect an impactful and inexpensive model using these campaigns to grow the movement, influence public opinion, and win ambitious laws, all to accelerate the transition towards a kinder world for animals. If I had to pick the top three reasons we consider ballot initiatives a particularly promising tactic for animal advocacy, they would be, in no particular order: In other words, while we aim to win ambitious laws for animals, that’s not the only impact our campaigns can have. Our ballot measures compel voters to wrestle with their owninner conflictsaround what happens to animals in these industries. And by offering lots of high-impact, low-risk ways to get involved, our measures can also increase the number of people who identify as pro-animal activists, increasing the power of our movement to win even greater change. Stage 1: Research Pax Fauna was founded in late 2020 and commenced full operations on March 1, 2021 (which we still observe as PF’s birthday). Our purpose was to identify and execute research projects for the purpose of overcoming flaws in the grassroots animal movement’s strategy.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/introducing-pro-animal-futures-10-year-plan/","All of us (Eva and Aidan, plus John who played a smaller but important role) had spent years organizing with Direct Action Everywhere, a social movement org known for confrontational protests but that I still insist is better characterized by a primary focus on community organizing. Through our time in DxE, we had seen many highs and lows, ultimately culminating in a frustrating plateau in the size of the organization and, as we saw it, the wider movement.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/introducing-pro-animal-futures-10-year-plan/","The two overarching questions we set out to address were: While we carried out several research projects, by far the largest share of our time was put into an extended study on framing and public opinion, eventually published as theEvolve Togetherstudy in aseries of lengthy reportsand a more conciseinteractive website. This research went far beyond messaging and is central to Pro-Animal Future’s current strategy. The next largest piece of research was on recruitment and retention of highly engaged activists and organizers, which we refer to as theOrganizer Study. At the end of 2022, as we were preparing to publish all of this and deciding what to do next, we learned that Brent Johannes, the initiator of the successful Boulder fur ban in 2021, was planning to carry out a ballot initiative in Denver in 2024. At this time, we had identified ballot initiatives as the central strategy of the social movement organization we were planning to incubate, but had not yet taken any concrete steps to shift into campaigning, and were by no means committed to doing so in time for the 2024 election. The rapid decision to hire Brent and adopt his Denver ballot initiative as our pilot campaign pulled us out of our comfortable ivory tower and compelled us to pivot toward campaigning on a much faster timeline than we may have otherwise. Stage 2: Pilot Campaign The last months of 2022 and the first of 2023 were spent frantically clearing a series of hurdles necessary to circulate a petition in the summer of 2023, including: At a team retreat in March of 2023, we agreed that the top priorities for the pilot campaign had to do with launching a new style of civic-focused animal advocacy, rather than in the immediate impact of passing one law.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/introducing-pro-animal-futures-10-year-plan/","This logic partly contributed to the measures we chose to pursue– we opted for policies that we felt would inspire the movement and give us a strong shot of initial momentum for a new strategy, as opposed to prioritizing the short-term instrumental impact of passing one policy vs. another. Thus the core goals of the pilot campaign were:","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/introducing-pro-animal-futures-10-year-plan/","We hosted a kickoff event in April 2023 which decisively marked the beginning of the Pilot Campaign stage. We received approval to start circulating the petition in early May. Through the end of October, our twin foci were gathering signatures and experimenting with our organizing model. While there were brief periods of anxiety, in the end, we comfortably cleared the required signature threshold, and refined a shift-based organizing model that we believe helped contribute to that success. 2024 marks the second phase of the pilot campaign: persuading and turning out as many voters as we can to support our measures at the ballot box. The campaign itself has two wings: By the end of the pilot campaign, we hope to have nearly optimized our organizing, voter outreach, and digital communications strategies, enabling us to be more effective from day one of our next round of campaigns. We also have some projects that are more purely focused on these future campaigns, including: Stage 3: Gain a Foothold For the 2025-26 election cycle, we hope to launch as many as 10 PAF chapters each pursuing their own ballot measures (usually in pairs) in different cities across the country. How many we can actually launch will depend on a few factors: Whatever the exact number of campaigns, starting in Stage 3, PAF will transition to a hub-and-spokes organizational model. A central hub will provide certain strategic capacities for all campaigns: social media, websites, design, software management, policy development, legal, etc. As a result, each additional chapter will only require one or two additional full-time organizers to focus on building the activist organization in each city. Even as of Spring 2024, I think of PAF as primarily building not a Denver campaign organization, but a national network of grassroots campaigning organizations with the capacity to run (eventually) dozens of municipal campaigns or several statewide campaigns simultaneously.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/introducing-pro-animal-futures-10-year-plan/","We should prioritize experimentation, and be willing to spend extra resources on testing and learning now whenever we feel confident that the results/lessons will be applicable to future campaigns. For example, we may choose to face rather than avoid an unknown risk in order to learn as much as we can.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/introducing-pro-animal-futures-10-year-plan/","Stage 4: Storm the Nation This strategic vision culminates in placing statewide measures to ban factory farming on the ballot in every state that allows citizen initiatives and may be reasonably receptive to such a measure. (We may also work to develop a parallel model that can be pursued in jurisdictions that don’t support citizen initiatives.) The rough plan at this point is that in each state, we would start with a single municipal campaign in a strategically chosen city, then scale to multiple cities across the state, building up our grassroots infrastructure and support from the wider public over multiple election cycles until we are prepared to run an effective statewide campaign. (While “effective” here does not necessarily mean winning the campaign on the first try, it does mean generating sufficiently positive impacts on public opinion and movement power to justify the cost and make an eventual victory more likely.) Statewide ballot initiatives are a massive undertaking. Merely qualifying a statewide measure through paid signature gatherers (the typical method) might cost $600,000 in CO and $3M in CA, while paid media budgets for large, contentious statewide campaigns often reach into the tens of millions. We aim to build a different model that more effectively incorporates people power and earned media, our movement’s relative strengths, while making the most efficient use possible of a smaller (but still substantial) ad budget. An organization capable of running 10 effective statewide ballot initiative campaigns simultaneously will necessarily be one of the largest in the animal advocacy movement (in terms of budget and impact, not to mention activists). That’s what we’re here to build. Beyond the Horizon Predicting the future is, to understate the case, difficult.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/introducing-pro-animal-futures-10-year-plan/","With the rise of artificial intelligence and other profoundly disruptive technologies, our society is almost certainly in for a wild ride over the coming decades, and that’s before we try to account for the climate crisis, nuclear-charged geopolitical conflict, and countless other sources of instability. Many institutions that we take for granted today may not exist in 40 years, at least not in their current forms. The world that emerges could be brighter, darker, or both.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/introducing-pro-animal-futures-10-year-plan/","What are animal advocates to do in the face of this volatility? At Pax Fauna, we believe the most reliable strategy is to try to shift cultural values. Efforts to change institutional policies (whether private or public) in ways that sidestep public attitudes are at risk of being completely washed away. But there seems to be a good chance that the fundamental values underpinning the human-animal relationship won’t be erased so easily. As the world continues to reinvent itself, opportunities will likely appear to affect change at a speed and scale that we can scarcely imagine now. Building new values around animals in as many clusters as possible gives us the greatest hope of seizing those opportunities. Statewide measures to ban factory farming are meant to provoke a sort of identity crisis for the voting public. We believe this is one of the best methods available right now to bring these values to the surface and force a re-examination. Social movement legend George Lakey likens this process to a forge, where heating up metal makes it malleable enough to reshape. The question is, will our movement be powerful enough and smart enough to shape things in the right direction? This 10-year plan is meant to put us in the best position possible.

"https://paxfauna.org/poll-denver-voters-support-pro-animal-policies/","GivenPro-Animal Future’songoingdual-ballot measure campaignin the city and county of Denver, we sought to poll Denver residents to better understand their baseline level of support for these two measures, which would 1)ban slaughterhouse operationsand 2)ban the sale of furin the city and county of Denver. Additionally, we sought to gain insight into their general attitudes towards the animals in our food system. Moreover, we testedvarious messagesin support of and opposing both measures to observe the effect, if any, they had on their support or opposition of these measures. We discovered higher-than-expected support for the slaughterhouse ban, and even higher support for the fur ban. 50.5% of the roughly 1500 Denver residents polled stated that they would “definitely” or “probably” vote yes on the slaughterhouse ban, while 58.0% revealed that they would “definitely” or “probably” vote yes on the fur ban.","text",2

However, this contrasts with strong support for statements such as “Humans have the right to breed animals for slaughter and consumption” and “Farming animals should continue to play a major role in food production because they provide affordable, nutritious protein to all consumers.” Again, these findings align with the results of numerous studies underscoring the cognitive dissonance, and perhapslack of information, present in the way consumers think about the way farmed animals are raised and treated.","text",5

"https://paxfauna.org/poll-denver-voters-support-pro-animal-policies/","These results reveal a promising base ofsupporters for pro-animal policiesamong Denverites. However, it also reveals a very tight race ahead for campaigners of both measures. Our results also reveal the counterintuitive ways in whichconsumers think about animalsin general. While they believe that animals should be treated humanely and should not be subjected to violence or harm, they also strongly believe that humans have the right to slaughter and eat them. This framework of thinking lends itself to the promise the researchers find in stepping back from the consumer frame that the animal rights movement has embraced since its inception, while embracing a “civic” frame– one that seeks change for animals through collective action, like voting, rather than individual actions, like diet change–  has for the animal movement.

"https://paxfauna.org/showing-our-work-on-social-connectedness/","This piece contains the processed data informing the findings we present inWhere the Animal Movement will be Reborn.We recommend reading that piece first if you haven't already, then coming back here if you want to see the data. Methods Data was drawn fromMeta’s Social Connectedness Index. We used Python to draw out data for each of the counties in which we were interested, adding data on the census population of each county. I examined the data for each county and noted more counties that showed up between the different counties’ data sets. Data for each of these is included except for Arlington, VA, which appears to be highly connected to many counties, we suspect because of its proximity to Washington D.C. While it shows up as a top connector for many of our interesting counties, these counties are not also a high connector for it. That is, if you live in Boulder County, you’re more likely to have a Facebook friend in Arlington County, VA than many other counties across the country, but someone in Arlington is not particularly likely to have a Facebook friend in Boulder or the other counties in which we’re interested. Hennepin, MN (Minneapolis) and Davidson, TN (Nashville) behaved similarly, showing up as top connectors for the interesting cities but without a mutual connection in most cases. I first examined data for Boulder CO, Alameda (Berkeley CA), Multnomah (Portland OR), and Buncombe (Asheville NC). After examining these data, I examined the data for other counties, which frequently appeared as connectors to the initial counties. Counties with less than 200,000 people were filtered out in all cases, because small populations have less potential for connections in general, and because small numbers are easier to skew, such as by one family moving from one county to another. Counties in the same state and in neighboring states were filtered out as well because geography is already a well-established predictor of connectedness.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/showing-our-work-on-social-connectedness/","However, because California and Texas are large states with interesting areas near their geographical centers, neighboring states were not excluded from their data.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/showing-our-work-on-social-connectedness/","For each county, after filtering the data, I recorded a list of the counties that appeared, in order. When several or more counties outside the targets appeared before one of the target counties, I recorded the target counties with a number, which indicates that counties rank in connectedness out of 3192, the total number of counties included in the dataset. Note that this does not account for filtering, so in general, there wasn’t a huge difference in the rank of the last county listed in order and the first one listed with a rank number. Top 10 connectedness indicates that after filtering, a county appeared as one of the first 10 listed. Top 10% connectedness indicates that the county’s rank is 319 or less. Top 10% connectedness is usually only slightly broader than Top 10. Hypothesis Counties Boulder, CO Boulder seems to be very well connected to the other counties we examined, appearing in the top 10 connectedness with all of them, and having all of the target counties in the top 10% of its connectedness. While Arlington VA, which is next to Washington DC, was highly connected with all of the counties we looked at, these counties didn’t appear asitsmost connected counties. In fact, with the exclusion of Arlington, each of the counties that appear as high out-of-area matches with Boulder is also highly connected with each other. Jefferson county, near Boulder and Denver, also often appears highly connected to the relevant counties. Alameda, CA (Berkeley) The Bay Area is highly connected to the counties we looked at. San Francisco, like Arlington, is a highly connected area in general, but Alameda county’s data displays a unique and mutual connection with the other areas- Boulder, Portland, Ann Arbor, and Austin. Its connection with Nashville and Minneapolis is also in the top 10% of connectedness. Multnomah, OR (Portland) Washington and Idaho were filtered out as neighboring states.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/showing-our-work-on-social-connectedness/","Californian states were initially not filtered out in order to examine the connectedness with the target Bay Area counties. As hypothesized, they ranked high in connectedness with Multnomah, in addition to Santa Cruz, which was later added to the list of target areas.  When CA counties were filtered out, the further counties appeared as highly connected.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/showing-our-work-on-social-connectedness/","Buncombe, NC (Asheville) While Buncombe, NC was highly connected to the other areas we examined, its highest connections were in the broader geographical area. Only when bordering states (SC, TN, VA, GA)  and also nearby states (FL, KY) were excluded did our target cities show up as its top connections. Given the size of North Carolina and its neighboring states when compared with the larger Western states, this probably does not indicate a lower level of connectivity than the other areas have. Low connectedness with Dane, WI, and Washtenaw, MI is noted. Travis, TX (Austin) Travis seems slightly less connected than the others, but all of the target areas are still relatively high, though Santa Cruz and Hawaii fall outside the top 10%. Dane, WI (Madison) I filtered out Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, and Michigan as neighboring states. Buncombe, Alameda, Santa Cruz, and Hawaii fall outside the top 10%. Multnomah and Travis are the nextmost connected counties after Hamilton, IN, afterwhich only target counties are listed. Santa Cruz, CA Santa Cruz is geographically close to the Bay Area counties but not directly next to them, and with the exception of Dane, all of the interesting counties are in the top 10%. Santa Cruz is about two hours from Berkeley by car, or about three hours via public transit. Washtenaw, MI (Ann Arbor) I filtered out Ohio, IL, and IN as neighboring states. WI didn’t show up in the data very frequently, even though Michigan’s upper peninsula borders Wisconsin, perhaps explained by Ann Arbor being in the Southeast corner of Michigan, furthest from Wisconsin. These data are presented without excluding Wisconsin. Hawaii, HI Our Bay Area counties show up as the most connected, and Portland is still in the top 10, as are Boulder and Buncombe. If we exclude CA and OR as neighboring states, then Boulder is #3. Travis and Dane fall outside of the top 10%. Denver, CO None of our target counties are in Denver’s Top 10, but the majority are in the top 10%.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/showing-our-work-on-social-connectedness/","Hawaii and Santa Cruz fall just outside the top 10% connectedness, while Alameda is around the 15th percentile.

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/analyzing-the-landscape-of-narratives-about-farming-animals-advocates-media-and-industry/","Analyzing the Landscape of Narratives about Farming Animals: Advocates, Media, and Industry 1. Introduction This report aims to provide an overview of the narratives currently in play by the industry, advocates themselves, and the Media. By noticing which narratives are and aren’t being echoed by the Media, we examine implications for advocates and inform the later phases of our messaging research. 2. Methods 2.1 Sample In conducting a review of materials recently disseminated by advocacy groups, we included website content from The Humane League (THL), Mercy for Animals (MFA), and Farm Sanctuary, as well as press releases from Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) regarding animals used for food, excluding press releases regarding animals used for other purposes such as entertainment and testing. Also included in this review were transcripts of popular videos from prominent advocates Earthling Ed, James Aspey, and Vegan Evan. The prominent individual advocates are considered one group for the purpose of analysis, given the cohesive strategy they collectively represent- convincing individuals to go vegan. While food is often discussed in the materials we reviewed, we intentionally excluded advocates known primarily for their discussion of food and health, regardless of their notoriety. We also exclude those whose primary audience consists of animal advocates or vegans, favoring instead materials directed toward the public at large. In our review of industry narratives, we conducted Google Searches ofSuperbowl ad meat, TV commercial meat, Cheese ads, meat ads,andmilk ads.We also reviewed the ads section of the website for Center for Consumer Freedom, the Animal Agriculture Alliance, the National Institute for Animal Agriculture, Farm Babe, and Meatingplace.","text",1
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/analyzing-the-landscape-of-narratives-about-farming-animals-advocates-media-and-industry/","We also examined the websites for animal product US Checkoff Programs, which are government-run advertising programs responsible for campaigns such asGot Milk?andBeef, It’s What’s For Dinner.They’re funded by mandatory fees paid by industry and thus are strictly regulated: US checkoff programs can use government funding to advocatefortheir product but notagainstany other. Checkoff programs we included were the American Egg Board, the American Lamb Board, the National Dairy Promotion and Research Council, and the National Pork Board.","text",2
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/analyzing-the-landscape-of-narratives-about-farming-animals-advocates-media-and-industry/","To review Media articles we made Google News searches using these keywords:animals food, animal agriculture, animal cruelty farming, farm animals, factory farming, aquaculture cruelty, animal rights,andanimal rights protest,and selected articles with titles and content discussing the ethical concerns of farming animals. All of the relevant articles published by news outlets on the first three pages of Google results were included in the analysis. Pro-advocate outlets, such as VegNews, and pro-industry outlets, such asAgweek,were excluded. Media Outlets were not excluded for political bias or small readership. We limited the Media analysis to articles published in 2022. Google searches for the Media analysis took place between Oct 31 and Nov 2, 2022. In October 2022, several newsworthy events occurred related to animals used for food: a trial and acquittal of animal rights activists in Utah, a sentencing of animal rights activists in Canada, and the arguing of California’s Proposition 12, landmark animal rights legislation, in front of the US Supreme Court. This may have created more positive Media dialogue than we may have observed had we conducted the searches at a different time. References for each section are indicated in-text by an endnote preceded with an abbreviation of the reference list from which it came- A for Advocate, I for Industry, and M for Media. 2.2 Analysis We used inductive thematic analysis to separately analyze each section, using the qualitative analysis software Taguette, which allows for creating tags to identify themes. Inductive thematic analysis is a process of analyzing qualitative data that identifies themes that are naMed as they emerge in the data. After gathering the samples and uploading them to Taguette, we identified themes and tagged instances in each sample while writing subject memos. This allowed us to examine the data by theme to understand how each idea presented throughout the sample. 3.","text",3

Each theme is discussed in further detail later in the report.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/analyzing-the-landscape-of-narratives-about-farming-animals-advocates-media-and-industry/","It seems that the Media is listening to advocates. Their efforts to get the issue on the table are fruitful and should be continued through legal cases, ballot measures, rescue, and investigation. The Media seems willing to engage with our strongest frames, and care should be taken to create situations and stories that emphasize them. The Media accept that animal farming is a problem that requires a solution, but the solutions they are currently presenting are not the ones advocates would hope to see. That said, overall the Media is receptive to our message. Ask for what we want Advocates can push harder when speaking to the Media. We have a real chance to win them over to our genuine goal: adopting a narrative that violence against animals is a sufficient reason to leave animal farming behind completely. We advise advocates to tell a story of societyshifting away from using animals for food, completely,in the light of any specific policy goals they’re working on. Use animals’ names Whenever it is natural to do so, name individual animals. This invites Media and others to do the same, which allows a semantic upgrade for animals from property to person and provides an identifiable victim with whom to feel empathy. Cruelty is widespread Consider the ramifications of emphasizing individual instances of cruelty, which may imply that unspeakable cruelty isnotthe norm in the industry. Instead, emphasize the ubiquity of animal cruelty as norms throughout the animal industries. Voters, not consumers De-emphasize the consumer frame to tell a story of voters and citizens, not consumers. Speak of change that society is undergoing together, shared values upheld by particular policies, and avoid making consumerist recommendations, even implied. Their activism is the slow, grinding work of changing cultural norms — to shift the value of a farmed animal from commercial to intrinsic.M55Torrella, K. (2022b, October 25).","text",5

Getting the issue on the table An “all press is good press” strategy suggests that some advocates are confident that when members of the public engage with their arguments, they’ll surely be won over. They also understand that their audience desperately does not want to hear from them. In the words of a seven-year-old Vegan Evan, “Most people don't think about what they're doing because they don't want to think about someone dying.""A6Bugga, H. (2021d, March 5). Beyond Meat Teams Up with McDonald’s, KFC, Pizza Hut, and More. Mercy for Animals.https://mercyforanimals.org/blog/beyond-meat-mcdonalds/ The Media sources we reviewed suggest this belief is correct: the news articles we examined were overwhelmingly positive and usually relayed advocate messages more strongly than industry ones. If bad press exists, the movement isn’t its cause. Significant exceptions to this observation demonstrate that the task ahead of us, in the face of effective industry messages picked up by the Media, is greater than simply getting the issue on the table. It will instead require using stronger messages that can overcome ineffective default frames and strong industry messages currently in use by the public and the Media. Advocates’ issue The solutions or “asks” offered by the advocates vary widely, as do their presentations of the issue. Moreover, the issue is often reduced to a list of terms that may not have much relevance to the reader, such as this quote from DxE, found within a press release that otherwise describes a protest:“It’s time to shut down factory farms and slaughterhouses and create a future that prioritizes compassion, public health and the environment.""A12Direct Action Everywhere.

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/analyzing-the-landscape-of-narratives-about-farming-animals-advocates-media-and-industry/","On the bright side, the Media does identify that animal agriculture has far-reaching impacts, which devastate habitats, pose a threat to human health, and exploit workers, among other things.

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/analyzing-the-landscape-of-narratives-about-farming-animals-advocates-media-and-industry/","There are lots of reasons why, on paper, meat grown in bioreactors is a brilliant idea. For a start, we’d be able to cut down on intensive animal farming, which can be brutal and inhumane. Rearing animals in cramped conditions can create the perfect conditions for diseases to spread, and even pass to humans.M22Hamzelou, J. (2022, October 28). Will lab-grown meat reach our plates?MIT Technology Review.https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/10/28/1062327/lab-grown-meat/ Even when a story clearly relates primarily to one problem with animal agriculture, the Media is willing to mention others. In the following instances of Media quoting advocates in pieces about the Supreme Court argument on California’s Proposition 12, legislation that protects animal welfare leads to a discussion of industry harms to human health. The Court has repeatedly affirmed the states’ rights to enact laws protecting animals, public health and safety, and the pork industry should focus on eliminating cruel caging of animals rather than attacking popular, voter-passed animal cruelty laws.M4Arnold, M.

The company gained a reputation as one using humane methods and all-natural feeds, and before long, became a hit in local grocery stores and popular San Francisco Bay restaurants.M21Hallman, A.

Government The Media was quick to criticize the government in multiple countries, discussing poor regulation, and low enforcement of laws protecting animals and the environment, and excitedly relaying the story of a multi-state FBI investigation over the rescue of two dying piglets. No instances of the industry responding to accusations of government corruption appeared in our reports. Instead, they pointed to government regulations to insist that their practices are held to high standards, or to cultural norms that using animals is acceptable and necessary. Discussion of regulation is the most common appeal to authority- if the industry is regulated, then how could anything bad be happening in it? These ideas weren’t found in the Media analysis. 9. Public Health Preventing the next pandemic: Advocates on public health As the advocate review was conducted in early 2021, advocates often invoked COVID-19 to criticize the industry for poor pandemic response and to emphasize the risk of animal agriculture towards creating “the next pandemic.”  This was detailed in a Media piece titled “How Factory Farming Could Cause the Next COVID-19”, which was published by The Regulatory Review, a University of Pennsylvania publicationM31Khodor, O.

Environment A second-rate reason: Advocates on environment Advocates mention climate change often and rarely describe any mechanism by which animal agriculture contributes to climate change, deforestation, ocean dead zones, or pollution.  Environment, like public health, seems to function as secondary support for veganism.

Consumers’ Responsibility Go Vegan: Advocates to consumers The advocacy organizations we examined are both distinguished and unified by veganism. We know that the strong supporters and workers of each organization are overwhelmingly vegan- people who abstain from consuming animal products out of an ethical objection to the practice. But veganism plays significantly different roles in their respective messaging strategies. DxE’s asks of supporters are usually in the realm of calling elected officials or law enforcement, signing petitions, or participating in protests and other events, without any consumer ask or discussion of veganism. PETA makes veganism the ask of the majority of their press releases, while MFA requests instead that the audience choose more plant-based foods. They also promote their vegetarian starter guide, which advocates for only plant-based foods.  THL also avoids veganism, and focuses consumer asks on meat consumption, such as by saying,“Curbing or eliminating your meat consumption makes the world a better place.""A25Is meat consumption in the US increasing or declining?(2021, March 21).

Conclusion Overall, the Media is receptive to reporting advocate frames. They acceptenvironmentandanimal sufferingas reasons why policies that move society away from using animals for food should be pursued but don’t always rely on advocating for the solutions that advocates most want. While comparing the effectiveness of advocates and industry messages is outside the scope of this report, the Media seems willing to amplify the messages in use by the subject of their stories. In a subsequent report, we examine how ordinary citizens understand the issues surrounding animals used for food in ways that do and don’t overlap with the frames used by the Media, advocates, and industry. This process allowed us to identify sticky and effective frames from each voice in the ecosystem and to identify frames that backfire. It is no surprise that the consumer frame, in heavy use by the Media, industry, and most advocate groups, was also heavily relied upon by ordinary Americans. In 1:1 interviews and focus groups we listened for frames used when the consumer frame was not present, and tested ways to overcome it.

"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","In theprevious article, I explained how the narrative of ""welfarism vs. abolitionism"" was misguided and created unnecessary conflict among animal advocates. Now, I show how, by switching to the vocabulary of ""inside game/outside game"", the animal freedom movement can shift from infighting to collaboration. The Gist Stronger Together I learned the phraseinside-outside strategyfrom thework of movement scholars Mark and Paul Engler, though I assume it’s been in use before them. The idea is simple enough: when social movements seek to change society, there are two routes they can take. One is to work inside the system, through the formal structures that have been set up to change policies. Running for office, getting a job inside a company or government agency, and corporate outreach are all ways to try to use the system’s built-in mechanisms to win a policy change. This is the inside game. The outside game consists of the kinds of strategies people turn to when efforts inside the system fail. The thing that unifies outside-game strategies isbuilding power outside of the dominant institutions.Once movements build alternative centers of power, they can try to exert pressure on the dominant institutions to accept change, or they can try to usurp and abolish those institutions altogether. Standard outside-game strategies include community organizing, picketing, civil resistance (e.g blocking roads or mass open rescues), and noncooperation (e.g. strikes). The phraseinside-outside strategyspeaks to the belief thatthese two approaches taken together are more powerfulthan their sum. The ideal dynamic is like this: Put another way, outside-game strategies target social and cultural norms, shifting the playing field and bringing previously unimaginable demands into the mainstream. The inside game then works to translate these cultural shifts into concrete changes in law and policy, before political inaction leads the culture to backslide.","text",3
"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","Dynamic Duo To give a fictional example of how this might work, imagine two organizations working to get the government of Los Angeles to buy animal-free food instead of meat for its public facilities. Humane LA focuses on the inside game, building relationships with friendly council members and eventually working with them to start a small default-veg pilot program in public hospitals. They become a familiar presence around City Hall and lawmakers know them as helpful, accessible experts on the issue.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","Meanwhile, Angelenos for Abolition is working the outside game, tracking down passive vegans and organizing them into a volunteer-led organization doing dramatic protests. By giving people a sense of ownership over their own participation in activism, A4A is able to build a list of hundreds of people willing to participate in their raunchy protests. Soon, their colorful antics demanding rights for animals are getting regular coverage in the local section of theLA Times. Once they’ve built up enough commitment from their members, Angelenos for Abolition decides to build a fortified encampment occupying the road in front of City Hall. Their action is unprecedented, and so is their demand: an animal bill of rights. Faced with what social movement theorists call amoment of the whirlwind,lawmakers turn to the familiar faces at Humane LA. “We’re already implementing the program you asked us for. Can’t you get these people to go home?” And what do they hear? “We’re not responsible for this. Those are the radicals! The current program isn’t enough for them. But, we just went out to negotiate with them, and we think we could get them to settle for 100% meat-free procurement across the entire city budget, based on our successful pilot in the hospitals…” Family Feud The inside-outside strategy sounds pretty good on the surface, especially when I oversimplify it as above. But unfortunately, across many different causes, it usually doesn’t work out so neatly. Conflict betweenoutside-game “radicals”and inside-game “moderates” is almost a universal truth of social movements. The reason, I believe, is that each side struggles to understand the reasons the other side pursues different demands. But it doesn’t have to be this way. If we can deeply understand the dynamics of the inside-outside strategy, we can transform our conflict into a brilliant bit of political theater.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","When inside- and outside-game players choose their demands, they are trying to meet a completely different set of needs.The job of the inside game is to gain access to key pressure points in the decision-making of the target institution. The outside game, meanwhile, aims to transform the norms surrounding the institution—the water it swims in.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","If inside-game players trumpet radical demands or use radical tactics, they will be frozen out of the dominant institutions. Then the movement will have no allies on the inside when the moment of the whirlwind hits. Our momentum will fizzle out without achieving concrete progress. Meanwhile, the entire purpose of the outside game is toshift the goalposts of the culture. If outside-game players pursue moderate demands, nobody will pay any attention, and the range of acceptable views will stagnate. Anddisruptive tactics can be a very effective wayto draw attention to these agenda-setting demands. How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love the Welfarists When I first learned about cage-free campaigns, naturally, I assumed that the main reason organizations like THL pursued them was because they thought it meaningfully improved the lives of egg-laying chickens. When I saw some footage of cage-free farms (and later, whenI set foot inside them myselfas an undercover investigator), I reached a different conclusion. Since then, Welfare Footprint released their findings from amassive study undertaken to quantify the suffering of hensin battery cage vs. cage-free facilities. Among animal advocates, the study did not change many minds. Those who already supported cage-free campaigns hold it up as the best stringent scientific examination of the welfare question; skeptics question the assumptions the study used to score different types of pain or outright reject the notion that suffering can be quantified in this way. These arguments often come down to disagreements on first principles, and it seems to me that no amount of data or debate will lead to a reconciliation.1For myself, I finally came around to believe in the welfare merits of cage-free campaigns when a colony of mice formed in my house.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","After other efforts failed, we decided we would build a house for them, trap them all together, and relocate the house as a whole to a faraway field where we would gradually wean them off food we provided. In the course of trapping them, however, I came to see the extreme traumatizing effect it had on these mice to be stuck inside the traps even for just an hour or two. The trap is large enough for them to move around, very similar to a battery cage, but they show signs of severe shock and lasting trauma if they are in it for more than a couple of hours. This experience helped me look at the Welfare Footprint study with new eyes, though I’m still sympathetic to those who argue against it as well.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","Regardless of how you feel about the welfare footprint of cage-free egg farms, however, there may be better reasons to celebrate these kinds of welfare campaigns in the animal movement. Here are three, starting from the least compelling and building up to the one that really convinced me. Reason #1: Driving up the cost of factory farming The first alternative explanation I ever heard for welfare campaigns was that they could effectively drive up the costs for factory farmers, reducing the profitability of the industry and, eventually, consumer demand for their products. This rationale was immediately more appealing to me than the welfare argument, and I could more easily see how this strategy could undermine the industry and bring us closer to abolition. For cage-free campaigns specifically, this argument was undercut by a recent economic analysis from California showing that the price of eggs statewide only increased$0.08 per dozen eggscompared to other states after full implementation of Prop 12’s cage-free requirement. It’s hard to imagine that an increase of less than a penny per egg will have any impact on demand. Ironically, while this news might make it easier to persuade other jurisdictions to adopt similar laws, it could also make outside-game activists less likely to accept these campaigns. But this doesn’t apply to all welfare campaigns. TheBetter Chicken Commitment, a bundle of welfare standards for chickens raised for meat, was designed specifically to force the commercial chicken industry to start absorbing its externalized costs. Reason #2: Build momentum with winnable campaigns This starts to get at the essence of theinside-outside strategy.While the radicals are working to build up enough power outside the system to create a crisis, the insiders can accumulate influence by winning modest reforms. These campaigns help the insiders gain recognition inside the system.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","They can even come to be seen as reliable experts who decision makers should consult on policies relating to their cause area.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","The crisis created by the radicals will create a tiny window of opportunity; it is crucial that inside game players are in this positionbeforethe moment of the whirlwind hits. Modest reforms are a tried-and-true way for them to elbow their way in. What’s more, these campaigns may even work to bring more of the public on our side for more ambitious demands. There isn’t yet enough research specifically looking at the effects of welfare campaigns on public opinion. But from what we know about psychology and marketing, welfare campaigns seem like they could be an effectivefoot-in-the-doorstrategy: by getting people to take a small action in support of a cause, we can sneak that cause into their identity. Once they’ve taken one supportive action, it will be easy and even imperative for them to bring their actions further in alignment. This could be a healthy complement to thedoor-in-the-facetechnique embodied by campaigns likeIP3 in Oregon; further research on these dynamics in our movement would be useful. Reason #3: Develop inside-game infrastructure This reason is closely related to #2, but I see it as distinct. I only became aware of this rationale recently. This fall, 6 years after Kristy (the local THL director) and I (the local DxE organizer) became an embodiment of the conflict swirling between our organizations and the larger movement factions they belonged to, I had the pleasure of meeting Dave Coman-Hidy, who led THL for the last decade. Dave built the organization from when he was one of a few employees to a force that had shaped animal welfare policies for several multibillion-dollar multinational corporations. So perhaps it’s to be expected that I learned something new about these campaigns from him. Dave and I got to talking about the inside-outside strategy, and I was surprised that we used much of the same language to talk about it.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","I was all ears when he told me there was one thing he wished the outside-game radicals understood: “I’m all for radical tactics pushing the boundaries of what demands we can make. But right now, the movement as a whole is not developed enough to effectively take advantage of it.”2(I’m paraphrasing)","text",12
"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","The truth is, right now both the outside and inside games in the animal movement are underdeveloped. We simply do not have the power culturally or politically to make the changes we need to make. The question we face is precisely the one posed by Freire: What can we do now in order to be able to do tomorrow what we are unable to do today? Nothing we can accomplish right now in terms of political or cultural change is exciting to me. I’m far more interested in asking how we can build enough power to be able to make those changes. For me, this is the crux of the conflict over cage-free campaigns: strategists like Dave were tasked with building up organizations that could powerfully fill a specific role in the animal movement ecosystem. As a small team with a small budget, THL needed to build an organization that could impact the policy decisions of governments and massive corporations. This meant building up a steady organization with dependable revenue streams, skilled staff, and durable organizational knowledge about how to navigate the halls of power. Eventually, they zeroed in on cage-free campaigns, around which not one, but an entire sector of inside-game organizations is being built. Who am I to argue with that? From Conflict to Collaboration Theinside-outside strategyis a much better way to make sense of old tensions in the animal movement thanwelfare vs. abolitionism. This new frame can help both sides understand each other. The outside game can understand why insiders use modest demands to strengthen their position inside the system. Meanwhile, the inside game can understand why outsiders incorporate radical demands that aren’t achievable in the short term. By demanding complete abolition, followers of DxE and Francione are trying to jumpstart the slow process of normalizing an idea that will take a long time to become mainstream.","text",13
"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","In the meantime, it serves to make other demands look relatively more modest, and thus makes them easier for inside-game strategies to pursue. Radical demandsgrab people’s attentionand can reshape the mainstream narrative in a way that modest demands cannot. If we are bringing people closer to our side, it doesn’t matter in the short term whether or not we’re getting what we ask for.","text",14
"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","Like all theoretical models, the inside-outside model I’ve relied on here is an oversimplification of the real world. In reality, THL has sometimes used informal means of creating pressure, such as protests, to push corporations to accept their demands. And DxE at times has turned to the legislative process to win real victories, such as banning fur in Berkeley and San Francisco, then the whole state of California. That said, I think the overall model holds up. It’s obvious to me that groups like THL are in a better position than DxE to negotiate with policymakers public and private; they have far more experience navigating those systems and have learned painful lessons. Meanwhile, DxE’s rugged grassroots orientation allows them to jump on risky, attention-grabbing tactics (likegluing their hands to NBA courts) that more conservative organizations won’t touch. We’ll Set ‘Em Up, You Knock ‘Em Down Does it matter that inside and outside game organizations understand each other? It’s possible that we can accidentally harness the inside-outside strategy even if we don’t get along. After all, the strategy is a kind of theatre, with roles for a good cop and a bad cop. Wouldn’t that work even better if we really believed it ourselves? Maybe, but I’m convinced we can do better the more we understand we’re on the same team. First, it makes conferences much more enjoyable. And I think it even makes us more effective. The essence of the inside-outside strategy is that we’re all building power towards amoment of the whirlwind,the time that our issue becomes a crisis for the dominant institution.

"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","Inside game: remember where you came from You’re going to use modest reform campaigns to position yourself at points of leverage inside the system. But don’t forget the endgame. Always remember that there will be a moment in the future when you can win something far more ambitious than what you’ve sought so far. That moment will come when a surge of grassroots pressure (combined with scrutiny from the press) forces the decision-makers close to you to wrestle with a truly radical activist demand. This surge of grassroots energy will probably be smaller than you think; it won’t look like Black Lives Matter or Occupy Wall Street, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t powerful. You’ll have spent years working to build these relationships and win modest reforms. It’ll be easy to mistake this moment for a threat to all your careful work instead of what it is: a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for truly transformational change. You’ll be the movement’s negotiators on the inside. Don’t sell us out for a cheap compromise in the exact moment we can go for a big win.

"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","I really love this! Seems to me one of the biggest challenges is building trust across the divide, especially since many of the most prominent advocates on both sides have spent decades in an antagonistic relationship. I can imagine a lot of people being open to this new perspective, but thinking ""why should I support them when they're not going to support me?"" Also, you didn't really acknowledge that there are non-negligible factions that in some ways actually don't share the same end goal. For example there are insiders (and insider orgs) who firmly believe it's totally fine to kill and exploit animals as long as they lived free from excessive physical pain. And there are outsiders who are more interested in attention, status, and broadcasting their virtue than actually helping animals. Do you think these are mostly just outliers, who draw undue attention to themselves (especially from those in the opposing camp)? Or is it an issue that requires further strategizing or changes to movement culture?","text",21

"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","That's a great point, Lucas. There are certainly a range of individuals and organizations primarily engaged in food-related advocacy whose end goal would be a different kind of animal farming. In my experience, these are orgs that care about animal welfare but tend not to put it front and center in their strategy, rather pairing it with other goals related to so-called ""regenerative ag"", etc. In my experience, the people involved in farmed animal advocacy at (e.g.) HSUS and ASPCA would like to see abolition just as much as you or I would, though others in their organization (including the people they report to) likely do not. I'm not sure who you have in mind re: outsiders seeking attention. I know some people would have seen DxE (my alma mater) that way, whereas I can say from the inside that the attention was a strategy we were committed to even though it usually made us uncomfortable. We can debate the merits of the strategy without doubting the intentions, which is obviously an overall theme of this piece. But maybe that's not the sort of thing you're pointing to?","text",23

"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","As a long-time producer of vegan community projects (since 2003) this article discusses important viewpoints. I have worked on projects for both inside and outside strategies. The main thing I have always been amazed is why the various vegan leaders and philosophies don't get along and have so much tension. We are supposed to model the compassionate hearts towards all beings that we expect others to adopt. If we are railing against our own community then how do exemplify a new consciousness? We don't, we just become another movement based on power struggles rather than being leaders to define a new process of doing things in the world. Mainstream culture still sees vegans as fringe people, no matter if you are inside or outside. Our challenge as a movement is to express compassion towards people that disagree with our viewpoint as a model for what is possible. Within that compassionate perspective we can still take action. But our action will resonate more with the very audience we seek to transform - those that still view animals as food and the environment as something we dominate and exploit for monetary gains. We have no sphere of influence over those people unless we can get their attention and trust so they might open up and actually learn from what we have to share. That kind of trust comes from suspending our moral outrage long enough to actually relate to what is important to them. I am from Hawaii and call it ""Aloha Activism"" and found it very successful to normalize vegan values within the local culture here in the islands ( I am the producer of the VegFest Oahu festival in Hawaii among many other projects). I want to see the leaders of the vegan movement stop judging each other and instead honor each other as working with different strategies, as this wonderful article suggests.","text",25

"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","I like the idea of defending both strtaegies and developing a complementary framing of why both can progress justice for other species. I'm curious how you see this working in the context of everyday consumers. Most people are unlikely to become activists and remain as somewhat passive consumers. I said in my other comment that I regard veganism as the idea that people behave as though other animals should attract three basic rights. To respect that approach one would choose not to buy animal products because animal-using industries violate these rights, however whilst these industries continue to use animals we still seem to be under a duty to advocate for welfare reform (to respect their right not to be treated cruelly). So in encouraging people to adopt vegan-friendly ethics we should hope to encourage people to limit or eliminate their economic support for animal-using industries, whilst also encouraging them to support appropriate welfare reform campaigns (via either protest, petitions, community feedback and even voting decisions). But should we ask for more than this? Or something different?","text",33

"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","A great contribution to the discourse. Having worked on both inside game and outside game stuff a lot of this rang true to me. One of my main concerns about the state of the movement currently vis à vis this question is 1. How do we reduce the hierarchy that often manifests whereby the professionals e.g lawyers and others working for orgs tend to get more clout/airtime/respect than the grassroots folks who may not have degrees but may have years of experience. I have seen a lot of classism/elitism manifest. 2. How do we balance the movement ecology? It appears to me that many facets of the inside game, (especially in recent years corporate outreach) are relatively well funded while many outside game projects are vastly under funded. I think the recent focus on effective altruism in the movement is one reason this may be the case but definitely not the only one.","text",35

"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/","Thanks, Becky! I'm so glad it resonated for you. I agree with your assessment that in many circles, inside-game orgs get more funding, clout, and airtime than grassroots orgs, whose approaches are often not seen as legitimate through an EA lens. Another way to look at it is that the movement is segregated or discontinuous between these two sides. For instance, the Animal Liberation Conference gives activists a ton of chance to hear from grassroots leaders, but the inside-game groups historically haven't been present there. I do see some encouraging signs that this is shifting, at least as far as clout is concerned. And for funding, the truth is grassroots groups don't need as much funding and often aren't constrained by it. I feel confident that as more grassroots/outside-game strategies demonstrate that they can deliver, there are funders who are able to assess those groups on their own terms and are prepared to come through with enough resources to support that part of the ecosystem. I do appreciate the challenge for funders: grassroots groups rightfully reject some of the limited measures of efficacy that work for evaluating things like corporate campaigns, but we need to offer different ways of assessing movement organizations, otherwise funders will feel like we're asking them to throw their very limited funds into a black hole when they could go to something else that is guaranteed to at least help a little bit.

"https://paxfauna.org/the-two-competing-strategies-behind-every-protest/","There are two fundamentally divergent theories of change behind direct action campaigns. They should never mix. What Do We Want?! Nothing is more closely associated with social movements than the image of a protest. Even for community organizers like me who know that protests are just the tip of the iceberg, the termsocial movementconjures images of lunch counter sit-ins and civil disobedience. Given the ubiquity of protests, it’s not surprising that there are several different reasons movement organizers employ protest tactics. All too often, however, organizers aren’t explicit even with themselves about the purpose of a protest. This exposes movements to a major strategic vulnerability. There are two main reasons social movements use protests. One is to put pressure directly on decision makers to cause them to accept protester demands. The other uses protest to attract attention and draw in new participants. On the surface, these objectives seem perfectly compatible, and indeed, they feed into each other in important ways. However, over the long term, an organization which lacks clarity about which of these two objectives isprimarywill find itself adrift. Each of these two strategies,pressure campaigningandmass movement building, serves a vital function for social movements, and a healthy social movement has plenty of room for both. But in this paper, I will demonstrate surprising ways that these strategies collide, making it unwise to combine them in a single protest or even a single movement organization. First, let’s briefly understand each strategy on its own terms. The Pressure Campaign Theory of Change This is the strategy that animates protest in the imagination of the public, and for good reason: pressure campaigns by a litany of NGOs (from Greenpeace and PETA to labor unions and the Breast Cancer Fund) have driven countless government bodies and corporations to adopt meaningful policy reforms.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/the-two-competing-strategies-behind-every-protest/","Pressure campaigners use protest to cause such a nuisance to their targets that its cost exceeds the cost of accepting the protesters’ demands. There are several ways protesters can exert this kind of pressure. Consider an activist group trying to pressure a company to change a policy. Activists can target the company’s reputation, which over time will cause economic harm to the company. Or they can disrupt the company’s operations directly, causing immediate economic harm. This doesn’t require destructive sabotage; blocking trucks from leaving a supply center can rack up huge costs for a company without exposing activists to the legal or reputational risks associated with property damage. Activists can also disrupt decision makers directly, by protesting outside their homes or sitting in at their offices. While these actions may not cause obvious economic harm to the company, they obviously inflict a different sort of cost. Beautiful Trouble’s teachingPoints of Interventionis emblematic of the pressure campaign theory of change.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/the-two-competing-strategies-behind-every-protest/","Pressure campaigns are not necessarily short-sighted. Strategists often choose to launch a pressure campaign to win a small victory as an incremental step towards a larger social transformation. They can also use a pressure campaign as a way to influence public opinion. Indeed, influencing public opinion can be both a method and a goal for pressure campaigns; campaigners seek to jeopardize a company’s brand in the eyes of the public to win a concession, and they also use their campaign to reach people and win support for their larger issue. Thus pressure campaigns can be seeking both institutional and cultural change at once. However, as astrategy,pressure campaigns put institutional changebeforecultural change. They situate a discrete policy change as their immediate objective, operating with the knowledge that incremental policy changes across society are key to driving long-term institutionalandcultural change. Because they win tangible victories on shorter timescales, pressure campaigns are appealing to donors, both large and small. In an organization with an established donor base, a pressure campaign will bring in enough donations to pay comfortable salaries to all the staff needed to organize the campaign. That doesn’t mean you’ll be able to pay everyparticipantin the campaign; you’ll need volunteers, but you may not need very many. This is crucial: a small number of people willing to be persistent and take legal risks are sometimes enough to pressure huge corporations to change their policies. Meanwhile, organizing volunteers takes time and effort, as does recruiting and training new ones.In a pressure campaign, there’s no reason to try to recruit more volunteers than you need to win. For all these reasons, pressure campaigns are especially popular with NGOs.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/the-two-competing-strategies-behind-every-protest/","An organization with an established reputation, a donor base, a modest staff, and a small base of dedicated volunteers familiar to the staff and their way of doing things is ideally suited to run a pressure campaign. An established donor pool means the org can focus on winning the campaign to impress its current donors, rather than finding news ones. Dedicated volunteers will trust the organizers with the strategy, so that organizers don’t need to worry much about making each protest a thrilling experience or even making sure participants understand how it contributes to the campaign. A more traditional organizational structure enables a high degree of strategic unity and quick decision making, helpful assets in oppositional campaigning. (There are certainly instances of major pressure campaigns run entirely by grassroots collectives, such as SHAC.)","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/the-two-competing-strategies-behind-every-protest/","In summary, pressure campaigns use protests to win incremental policy changes by leaving decision makers with no better option. The immediate goal is institutional victories; engaging activists and shaping public opinion are means in service of that goal. The Mass Movement Theory of Change Alongside the rich tradition of pressure campaigning, there exists a separate tradition of social change movements which essentially invert that strategy. For mass movement strategists in the vein of Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., incremental policy demands are merely a tool for catalyzing dramatic cultural and political transformation by engaging large numbers of activists in dramatic confrontations with the status quo. While pressure campaigners use protest primarily to put pressure on decision makers, mass movement organizers have different objectives in mind. Their primary objective is to rapidly transform the cultural and political imagination of the public, usually of an entire nation. Mass movements subdivide this into two core objectives:active popular supportandpassive popular support. Protest is crucial to both. Passive popular support is the number of people who agree with the vision the movement is advocating for. If the movement can win over an electoral majority to support its vision, it doesn’t need incremental policy wins; it can enact its demands in one fell swoop through government action. These movements aim to drive their ideas into the political mainstream, thus opening up far greater possibilities for institutional change across the board. They use protest to force attention onto an issue which societies gatekeepers are otherwise ignoring, to start a conversation across society and gradually win people over. These protests are designed to be maximally visible to the public and the press.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/the-two-competing-strategies-behind-every-protest/","They happen in population centers where the greatest number of people will see them, the press will have no trouble getting there to document them, and members of the public can easily join in. Ancillary protests may take place at other points of intervention, but make no mistake, these protests are much more about building excitement among movement participants than exerting pressure on institutions.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/the-two-competing-strategies-behind-every-protest/","This is where active popular support comes in. A handful of people may be sufficient to disrupt a supply chain for one company or otherwise cause a massive headache for its executives, but to force a society-wide reckoning, much larger numbers of people are needed. Active popular support is the number of people actively contributing to the campaign by coming to protests, or even by putting a sign on their lawn or talking to their friends about the issue. The mass movement theory of change believes that engaging mass numbers of activists in the movement sets off a number of chain reactions across society, and mass movements use protest to build active support. Protests are how movements attract new participants and provide them with a transformational experience which causes them to identify with the movement and begin advocating in their social networks. The attention gathered by protests on traditional and social media alerts potential new participants to the existence of the campaign. Skillful mass movement organizers work hard to promote protests, then try to contact every new person who attends and plug them into the organization's network. If the only consequence of a protest is to bring a few new people on board so that the next protest can be bigger, mass movement organizers consider it a success. Because it is central to their theory of change,these organizers are willing to compromise nearly any other objective in order to engage more activists in the movement. Institutional policy demands have a place in mass movement organizing, but they are a tool rather than an objective. They exist to legitimize the campaign in the eyes of its supporters and the public. Mass movements select demands for theirsymbolicvalue. These movements are best understood as social theater; in a sense, a mass movement is a theatrical performance of a pressure campaign, with the whole society as an audience!","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/the-two-competing-strategies-behind-every-protest/","The movement must present a compelling performance that the purpose of protests is to win immediate policy changes. Without credible demands, few people will be inspired to join the campaign, and the public will condemn the protests as pointless trouble-making or attention-seeking. The demands must seem achievable, but also be bold and attention grabbing. Occasional victories are even necessary to sustain the excitement of participants and the public, though skillful organizers can create a sense that a victory has been accomplished without any concession from the targeted institution.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/the-two-competing-strategies-behind-every-protest/","Gandhi and King frequently justified their campaigns with modest, incremental demands which dramatized or encapsulated the larger injustice. But their true strategy had little to do with actually winning these demands, and in fact, many of the campaigns now regarded as pivotal victories in their movements did not achieve any immediate institutional change. For instance, the salt march remains Gandhi’s most famous campaign, a massive act of civil disobedience where hundreds of satyagrahis endured vicious beatings merely for trying to collect salt directly from the ocean and thus avoid paying a British tax. To many of Gandhi’s fellow strategists, this objective seemed farcical, a distraction from the essential issue of British occupation. What’s more, after a year of campaigning and extraordinary sacrifice from many thousands of Indians, Gandhi negotiated an agreement with the occupiers whichdidn’t even end the salt tax. Yet the campaign had a dramatic symbolic effect that Gandhi’s detractors, British and Indian alike, only recognized later. According to Gandhi biographer Geoffrey Ashe, the British officialdom “ever afterwards groaned over Irwin’s move [to negotiate with Gandhi] as the fatal blunder from which the Raj never recovered.” Mass movement organizations tend to employ very different structures than organizations that run pressure campaigns. Because they prioritize engagement over other strategic objectives, mass movements use decentralized structures, trading in strategic unity and easy coordination in favor of a scalable structure that eliminates barriers to entry for new participants. Though they mobilize far greater numbers of people than NGOs, they almost always operate on much smaller budgets. Even with an NGO budget, however, mass movement organizations could never afford to pay all the organizers needed to engage activists at scale.","text",12
"https://paxfauna.org/the-two-competing-strategies-behind-every-protest/","These movements depend on a mass volunteer model, with perhaps a small number of paid staff taking a support role to enable volunteer organizers to do the work of the movement.","text",13
"https://paxfauna.org/the-two-competing-strategies-behind-every-protest/","Mass movements use protest to seize the public’s attention, shifting public opinion and attracting new participants. In contrast to pressure campaigns, the immediate goal of mass movements is cultural transformation; announcing policy objectives is merely a tactic to win legitimacy in the eyes of the public. This table summarizes some of the key differences between these two protest strategies. PB&J or Oil and Water? Ok, so pressure campaigners and mass movement organizers each use protests to accomplish different objectives. But are these two strategies really incompatible? At the level of movement ecology, they are certainly compatible. Each strategy understands that cultural change and institutional change are deeply entangled in a feedback loop. The concrete policies held by both public and private institutions are a reflection of the cultural mainstream, and at the same time they play a major role in shaping what the public is able to imagine. I have writtenelsewhereabout the interplay between cultural and institutional change, but the essence is that they must proceed in lockstep, with one reinforcing the other. If cultural change is not codified into laws and policies, the change is almost certain to regress, due to the constant feedback that existing social structures exert on social ideology. But institutional change can’t get out ahead of cultural change, either: if a coalition of advocates manages to win a policy change that is too far outside of the Overton window, there will be a political backfire, and the change will be repealed. Different strategies are able to intervene at different points on that feedback loop. That’s one way to understand the difference between the two strategies in question: pressure campaigns seek immediate institutional change, mass movements seek immediate cultural change, and both strategies are in service of greater institutionalandcultural change in the long term.","text",14
"https://paxfauna.org/the-two-competing-strategies-behind-every-protest/","There are also more specific ways that the symbiosis between these strategies manifests at the inter-organizational level. Most obviously, when mass movements are able to shift the overton window, they enable pressure campaign organizations to pursue more ambitious goals. Mass movements also attract huge numbers of new participants, many of whom gain experience and become the dependable activist base that pressure campaigners draw on. In the opposite direction, pressure campaigns institutionalize and concretize the progress made by mass movements. Critically, they also provide mass movements with a stream of victories to celebrate, helping their participants see that they are accomplishing something tangible and thus sustaining motivation.","text",15

"https://paxfauna.org/the-two-competing-strategies-behind-every-protest/","Strategic Gridlock However, an organization which is tempted to pursue both of these two strategies on equal footing will find itself in a bind. Let’s look at three reasons these strategies don’t mix well inside an organization. Volunteers Are a Giant Pain in the Ass Anyone who ever held any responsibility in a mass movement context knows that organizing large numbers of volunteers is the least efficient way to do literally anything. Yet getting work done with volunteers is at the heart of the mass movement theory of change. I already mentioned that movements simply will never have enough money to pay everyone contributing to mass movement organizing. More importantly, however, creating opportunities for volunteers to take ownership of meaningful work is essential for an organization to achieve exponential growth. Joining a team and becoming an organizer transforms participants in a whole new way, inspiring them to bring their friends out to protests and to generally champion the cause and the organization every chance they get. Political scientist Hahrie Han has demonstrated that movement organizations succeed in engaging far more people when they involve volunteers in the work of organizing and decision-making in a meaningful way. Recruiting, onboarding, training, and mentoring new participants to the point that they can take on work, and eventually even assume leadership roles, requires an enormous investment of resources on the part of the organization. No sane organization would choose to do this unless it inextricably woven into their objectives and strategy. And the fact is, this kind of volunteer engagement simply is not necessary for waging effective pressure campaigns. If an organizer or team is told that their objective is to win a specific concession from a specific institution, they will quickly realize that trying to involve new activists in that work as anything more than bodies at a protest is inefficient to the point of being irresponsible.","text",18
"https://paxfauna.org/the-two-competing-strategies-behind-every-protest/","Instead, they will take the most direct route possible: doing the work themselves and turning out just enough volunteers to the protests for it to serve the campaign.","text",19
"https://paxfauna.org/the-two-competing-strategies-behind-every-protest/","This is what I experienced as I was cutting my teeth in Direct Action Everywhere, and I think most DxE organizers would agree with that description. DxE’s flagship chapter in Berkeley has been trying for years to increase the size of its grassroots membership with no success. At the same time, organizers have gotten better and better at making do with the number of people they do have to achieve other kinds of victories. A large percentage of the group’s volunteer members have been around for years, creating a deep well of trust between activists and organizers. This enables DxE to do things that many grassroots groups its size can only dream of. For now, DxE continues to invest considerable energy and staff time into largely fruitless efforts to grow its volunteer base (it does bring in new members, but others leave at the same rate), begging the question of what else could be done with that energy that might be more productive. Different Objectives Require Different Protests and Structures Could you have one team of organizers focused on engagement and another focused on pressure? You could, at the effect of shearing the organization into two largely unrelated and inharmonious halves. If, for instance, the team planning protests is told that their objective is to win a pressure campaign, they won’t plan protests that are compatible with the goal of increasing engagement. For instance, mass movement organizers might prioritize protests in easily accessible locations on weekends or evenings so more people can come; pressure campaigns might be better served by disruptions on remote, rural points of the supply chain or in an office during business hours. While these may not seem inherently contradictory, in practice they are often at odds. I saw this tension play out in my time with Extinction Rebellion UK.","text",20
"https://paxfauna.org/the-two-competing-strategies-behind-every-protest/","XR is a quintessential mass movement organization, using a highly decentralized structure to engage massive numbers of people in general disruption of central London with symbolic, non-specific demands. XR’s democratic nature enabled many sub-groups to emerge within it pursuing different strategies, and naturally some groups were drawn towards pressure campaigns. One such faction within XR got involved with a campaign to try to stop the construction of a new high-speed railway (HS2) which was annihilating some of the last old-growth forest in the UK, destroying hundreds of thousands of trees and likely driving several species into extinction. I tear up now thinking about the devastation caused by the construction of HS2, which continues today. Yet this created a conflict over strategy in XR. After two large rebellions in London, some organizers thought that XR’s next sustained mass mobilization should take place at the remote construction site of the railway. Other organizers argued that far fewer people, especially new activists, would participate in an action that was difficult to get to; the action would undermine XR’s growth strategy, ultimately key to changing the political landscape concerning environmental destruction. The people organizing against HS2 were free to plan protests at the construction site using XR’s name, but asking for their campaign to displace XR’s central strategy of building mass engagement would have been a step too far and sent XR off course. In the end, XR stuck with its core strategy and held another mass disruption in London.","text",21
"https://paxfauna.org/the-two-competing-strategies-behind-every-protest/","Similar contradictions appear in the structures that support the two strategies. As I described earlier, mass movements benefit from highly decentralized structures with minimal barriers to entry, while pressure campaigns demand a fast, highly coordinated decision-making structure to respond to the rapidly evolving campaign. You could attempt to blend these by embedding a pressure campaign structure inside a mass movement structure, but again, in practice this causes friction. DxE and XR UK each attempted a structure somewhat like this, and in each case it led to a crisis of legitimacy, with volunteers in the decentralized structure growing resentful of the core leadership, who were paid. There is always, in any organization, an appeal to do a bit of everything. But the most successful organizations instead identify their niche and focus on doing it very well. Pulled Towards Pressure: The Cannibal Twin Effect One of the greatest challenges facing mass movement organizers is that cultural change is largely intangible while it is happening. It involves counterintuitive processes and it is virtually impossible to establish clear causal relationships between a discrete event and its impact on the culture. Often when culture change movements are at the height of their vibrancy, many participants feel frustrated that their efforts don’t appear to be accomplishing anything concrete. For instance, even a few weeks into the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, just as I and others were amazed by their cultural shockwaves, many participants started to feel the movement was failing because it hadn’t already enacted its agenda in policy. This effect goes doubly for organizations with high-dollar donors, who often want to see exactly what their money is getting. For this reason, organizations that try to balance these two theories of change end up getting pulled further and further towards the pressure campaign approach over time.","text",22
"https://paxfauna.org/the-two-competing-strategies-behind-every-protest/","Pressure campaigns are much more likely to provide the tangible victories organizations need to justify their existence to supporters, donors, and even staff. The pressure campaign strategy crowds out the mass movement strategy like a fetus devouring its twin. The only way for an organization to resist this is to be exceedingly persistent and explicit in communicating the mass movement theory of change to its organizers and supporters, even juxtaposing it against the pressure campaign strategy so as to preempt any temptation.","text",23
"https://paxfauna.org/the-two-competing-strategies-behind-every-protest/","I’ll Meet You in the Promised Land Hopefully, I’ve demonstrated that every protest organization needs to decide whether it is using the pressure campaign or the mass movement theory of change. I want to reiterate that I fully believe each of these strategies is whole and valuable to the movement. The most important question is not “which of these strategies is therightone?” but “which of these strategies is rightfor my organization?”Depending on an organization’s structure, culture, and history, it will be able to contribute more by following one strategy or the other, but not both. I will finish, however, with a caveat. There is a point in the lifecycle of a social movement, at the zenith of its activity, in which these two strategies completely merge. For example, when civil resistance movements topple governments using weeks of sustained mass protest and noncooperation, they are making full use of both theories of change. These revolutions place enormous pressure on the most powerful individuals in a society by essentially shutting down the economy until their demands are met, ensuring that the cost of ignoring them is literally greater than the cost of acceding. And they do it by drawing absolute maximum participation into a campaign of generalized disruption, usually growing at this point into something almost completely structureless. Hypothetically, these same dynamics could occur in a reform movement, as opposed to a revolution, but to date this has not occurred; it simply hasn’t been necessary for social movements to win changes less absolute than the replacement of a regime. So for now, let’s focus on doing what we know works: using the tremendous power of protest to advance a single, clearly defined strategy for each organization we operate, building a diverse movement ecology working towards the dramatic institutional and cultural change we so desperately need.","text",24

"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-blind-spot/","Part 1 ofIt’s Social Norms, Stupid This post is the first in a series of three articles. In part one, I make the case that the farmed animal movement’s dominant theory of change neglects the role of social norms in shaping people’s attachment to meat. As a result, current strategies are insufficient to bring about the end of animal farming. Inpart two, I’ll introduce the science of social networks, which has cast new light on how changes in norms spread. Inpart three, I present social movements as a potent strategy for unleashing the power of social networks to change norms at scale, particularly in the case of animal freedom. The Gist What’s in a Food Choice? At a recent conference, I had a chance to hear Bruce Friedrich of the Good Food Institute give his standard talk on GFI’s work. In case you’re not familiar, GFI exists to support the development of animal-free foods by coordinating the industry, conducting research, and lobbying. I’ve heard a fair amount about GFI’s theory of change, and I wasn’t expecting anything surprising, though I was impressed with how polished and forceful a talk Bruce fit into 15 minutes. It was reassuring to imagine him as a representative for the cause, giving this pitch to legislators. Yet even though I knew to expect it, one moment in Bruce’s talk has been replaying in my mind: when he asserted that “people decide what to eat based ontaste, price,andconvenience.” I’m so familiar with this argument that it exists in my head as an acronym: theTPC postulate.1Many thanks to Jacob Peacock for some of the insights, terminology, and research used to discuss the TPC postulate in this post.The TPC postulate holds that the moment animal-free foods taste the same or better, cost the same or less, and are as accessible as animal meat, people will choose to buy them instead.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-blind-spot/","A substantial portion of the animal movement’s resources is invested in the TPC postulate each year.2It is difficult to quantify the extent of resources invested in the TPC theory of change. Data collected byJames Ozdenindicates major EA grantmakers directed only about 9% of their combined $84 million in animal funding in 2021 towards cultivated and plant based meats. However, I’m arguing that some of the much larger portion of funding ($50 million, or 60%) spent on corporate campaigns should be considered here, because one of the two major goals of these campaigns is increasing the cost of animal products. But all this is dwarfed by the nearly $5 billion dollars raised by alternative protein companies in 2021, according to GFI. It isn’t easy to compare philanthropic funding with venture capital, but if even 1% of those funds were motivated by altruistic desire to end animal farming, it would make alternative protein the largest category in animal movement expenditures.Organizations using this theory of change work either to improve animal-free foods or to drive up the cost of producing animal meat. The latter is one strategic argument I’ve heard in favor of welfare campaigns for cage-free eggs or theBetter Chicken Commitmentfor chickens raised for meat: higher welfare products are more expensive to produce and thus less competitive with ever-improving alternatives. Together, these two parts of the movement (those working to drive up the cost of meat or drive down the cost of alternatives) make up what I call theEconomic Theory of Change.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-blind-spot/","This is what Bruce was referring to when he said that “people decide what to eat based on taste, price, and convenience.” There’s just one problem: that statement has some major flaws. In fact,the TPC postulate makes a huge error, one which highlights what I believe is the biggest gap in the animal advocacy ecosystem today.3A quick disclaimer: I think highly of GFI. I’m confident their work is worth doing, and as far as I can tell they seem to be doing a great job with it. It could be that they are well aware that the TPC postulate is incomplete, but they’ve chosen to focus on those factors in their own work, and therefore it makes sense to focus their pitch to politicians on those factors. Or they really believe taste, price, and convenience matters the most, which might be just fine given the role they’re performing in the animal movement ecosystem. My intention here is not to say GFI should change anything about their work, it is just to make clear that we should not rely on their work alone to bring about the end of animal farming.My goal for this series of posts is to illuminate that gap and chart a path for how to fill it, using three closely related ideas: social norms, social networks, and social movements. The Price of Eggs in Chinatown Where in the world is the missing piece of the TPC postulate? We might begin our search in New York City. Like most cities, NYC grows virtually no food; food is brought in on trains, trucks, and boats from all over the world. From the standpoint of taste, price, and convenience, everyone in the city has access to basically the same foods at the same price. Yet on a day’s walk through Queens and Brooklyn, you could pass through a dozen ethnic enclaves and watch the food environment change dramatically. Totally different foods dominate in Chinatown than in Petit Senegal, Bangla Town, or Jamaica.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-blind-spot/","As a reader at this point, I’d be thinking, “What a mundane observation.” Of course people from different cultures eat different foods. Yet this unremarkable fact flies in the face of the TPC postulate. Thereis much more to people’s food choices than just taste, price, and convenience.Rather,people’s relationship to food is mediated by deep cultural attachments, such as nostalgia for familiar childhood foods.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-blind-spot/","But can’t we just replace the meat in those dishes with identical cultivated meat or equally tasty meat made from plants? That depends on what it means to beidenticalorequal. In a2008 study, researchers gave participants two sausages. One was made from a pig, and one was from plants.Most people said they preferred the taste of the pig sausage. No surprises there, but plant-based meat has improved dramatically since 2008, right? Not so fast. The twist of the study is that half of the participants were misinformed about which sausage was which. And the decisive factor determining which sausage people preferred was not what it was made of, but what peoplethoughtit was made of. The actual chemistry of the sausage didn’t matter. Most people preferred the taste of the sausage theythoughtwas from a pig, regardless of whether it was. And who are we to argue? This is precisely the point: taste lives not in the physical form of the food we eat, but in our minds. The chemical reactions of food-on-tongue are only one factor. Consider thatwine tastes better when you think it’s more expensive. A Matter of Taste So what factors besides chemistry might shape people’s perception that animal meat tastes better? This is an existential question for animal advocates. Without the right answer, we may never overcome public ambivalence about animal-free food.Withthe right answer, we may find an even more direct path to ending animal farming than we ever thought possible.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-blind-spot/","It turns out thatcultural attachments have everything to do with people’s preference for “real” meat from animals.In Pax Fauna’s public opinion research4Aqualitative studyinvolving over 100 hours of interviews with more than 200 meat-eating Americans.with ordinary meat-eating Americans, culture has been one of the most consistent themes, as in these quotes: In fact, in the aforementioned study using sausages, while most people preferred the animal-based sausage (or so they thought), some preferred the sausage theythoughtwas plant-based. And researchers noticed a pattern: the thing that predicted what sausage people would prefer was theircultural values.Cultural values affected people’s experience of the taste of each sausage more than chemistry.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-blind-spot/","Or consider the blowback against GMOs. Genetically modifying crops promised to make food less expensive and perhaps even more nutritious without changing the taste. Opposition to GMOs had nothing to do with taste, price, or convenience. The concerns were economic (small farmers’ control over their own crop supply) as well asnaturalistic.Whatever your personal feelings about GMOs, this is a cautionary tale for animal-free foods. Anti-GMO campaigns successfully banned the practice in dozens of countries, and the samenaturalistic values are central to many consumers’ attachment to meat from animals,at least according to our research participants: Without a doubt, taste, price, and convenience have also been common themes in our interviews. But if the participants are taken at face value, addressing these issues alone would fall short of overcoming people’s attachment to animal meat. It’s Social Norms, Stupid Besides taste, price, and convenience, people’s food choices are heavily shaped by deeper values connected to culture and naturalism.These values are less tangible than price and chemistry but they are no less real and may be even more important. As the story of GMOs shows, animal advocates cannot afford to ignore them. Yet even culture and naturalism may represent only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the psychology of meat. Research points to an even bigger obstacle to changing eating habits. This problem has been articulated with brilliant simplicity by Dr. Melanie Joy: most people eat meat because… most people eat meat! That is, mostindividualseat meat becauseeveryone around them is doing it. While culture and naturalism may be the frames through which people rationalize their continued meat consumption despite their ethical misgivings about killing animals for food,social reinforcement is the much more powerful force keeping this norm in place.Social norms influence our behavior in profound ways that we are often totally oblivious to.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-blind-spot/","Instudyafterstudy, people are able to see that social norms are influencing other people’s behavior but deny the effect on themselves. Yet in the case of meat-eating, we have found that these normative effects are so undeniably strong that a reasonable number of people are able to recognize them:","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-blind-spot/","Arecent studyby Faunalytics reached similar conclusions about the main barriers to diet change. Researchers followed new vegetarians over a period of six months and asked about the top barriers people experienced to maintaining their new diet. They found that while cost and convenience (“Difficulty finding or preparing veg*n food”) were factors, “The worst barriers to diet change were feeling unhealthy, not seeing veg*nism as part of one’s identity, and believing society perceives veg*nism negatively.” In other words, social factors (and health). Of 14 barriers Faunalytics identified, 7 were different types of social and cultural influence, 2 were health-related, and taste, price, and convenience were each one.5Faunalytics found that social strategies were only modestly effective in helping people overcome these barriers. Still, as you will see, the approach I propose in this series of articles is far more sweeping than the ones they tested.","text",12

People have deep ethical misgivings about killing animals for food, but they continue to eat meat. Taste, price, and convenience are part of the reason, but they only scratch the surface. Deeper values of culture and naturalness contribute to meat attachment, even shaping taste experiences. But social reinforcement may play the most significant role of all.","text",15

Instead, we must figure out how to engage at a higher level, rather than trying to reach consumers one at a time. We need a systems model for understanding the web of interactions and signals that create dominant norms in society, and a set of strategies for shattering the equilibrium around one of the world's most prevalent, entrenched social norms.

"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-blind-spot/","I have been enjoying reading your reports and blog posts since discovering this site today. There are several interesting underlying themes that seem apparent. First, people like to eat animals, in fact they have deep cultural ties to doing so. Even though they may be uneasy at aspects of the industry, this seems to be separate from the tendency to see eating animals as somehow inherent in the human condition. Second, it seems difficult to find the message that resonates with most people, though perhaps younger people today are more open to tackling such concrns. And lastly, people seem open to ideas of justice for other species, at least on the surface. And yet paradoxically, most distrust and even dislike animal rights activists, vegans and veganism. What do I conclude from all of this? Well... counter-intuitively I suspect trying to convince people to abandon eating animals is guaranteed to fail except at very small scale. It is simply too big a stretch for most. As well, veganism as an idea seems now so deeply tainted by its toxic cultural baggage that probably everyone who is ever likely to genuinely embrace ethical veganism already has done so. Given that the cultural imperative to eat animals is so deeply ingrained (and with good reason, if we think about what hundreds of thousands of years of hunter/gatherer cultural evolution means), veganism as popularly understood can go no futher. Without a fundamental reformation of this philosophy and movement, I cannot see any genuine progress. I'm not well versed in the animal rights movement, but I think casting the problem of animal use and exploitation in the context of a rights or justice based concern with real-life consequences that depend on the individual's circumstances and motivations is where the future lies.","text",24
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-blind-spot/","I'd even go so far as to observe that such a strategy is likely to bear more fruit if a longer term view is taken.For example, actually partnering with, or at least co-existing with such movements as reducetarianism, ethical omnivorism and regenerative farming provide much more fertile ground for an eventual progression of local cultural attitudes to animal farming and justice for the animals concerned. The current paradigm of actively attacking and judging people for doing wrong when they engage in practices deeply rooted in our cultural history and psyche seem far less likely to truly flower into anything useful.","text",25

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","A Review of Contemporary Research into Public Perceptions of the Slaughter Industry 1. Introduction The objective of this report is to review existing research exploring public opinion related to the use of animals for food. Determining what is already known about the public’s understanding will guide us as we explore new avenues for communication. To that end, we searched academic databases and gray literature to compose a final sample of nearly 70 recent studies analyzed in this report. This research paints a complicated picture of Americans’ relationship to meat and animal farming, perhaps best summed up by one researcher’s observation that meat from animals is “simultaneously... deeply popular as well as troubling among the same people.”11Chiles, R. M. (2016). Hidden in Plain Sight: How Industry, Mass Media, and Consumers’ Everyday Habits Suppress Food Controversies. Sociologia Ruralis, 57, 791–815. While the public’s thinking about meat is often blatantly contradictory, numerous patterns nonetheless emerge from the research which can offer guidance to animal advocates. We offer a brief summary of some representative insights before presenting our findings in full. 2.Just the Headlines 3.Sample & Methods The scope of this review was rather broad, encompassing several sub-topics including perceptions of animal welfare and industry practices; opinions about a range of issues including animal rights, public health, and environment; perceptions of the animal movement; and public reaction to the nascent field of high-tech meat alternatives. Anything which appeared to relate meaningfully to our overall research question was included, with two exclusion criteria: we only included studies that included a sample in the United States (or in Canada due to the high cultural proximity between the two nations), and we excluded studies published prior to 2015 in order to get an up-to-date snapshot of how the American public understands issues tied to using animals for food.","text",1
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","In April 2021, we conducted an extensive search on a variety of databases including Google Scholar, Science Direct, Roper iPoll, and Elsevier for combinations of keywords includingmeat, animal welfare, animal rights, slaughter, public opinion, public perception, consumer, beef, pork, chicken, fish, climate change, global warming, vegetarian(ism), vegan(ism), plant based, cultivated meatand others (several of these searches returned zero relevant results, especially when excluding research without a North American sample or prior to 2015). We also conducted searches on the websites of animal advocacy organizations known to conduct or write about formal research (Faunalytics, Mercy for Animals, Rethink Priorities, The Humane League, and Animal Charity Evaluators), and emailed researchers at these organizations to request unpublished materials. Over 60 qualifying studies were identified through these searches, and a further 10 or so relevant studies were identified in the citations of the initial studies, based on the title and abstract of the published work. During the course of analysis, about a dozen sources were determined to be irrelevant to our research despite our initial impression, leaving a final sample of 67 sources. Ultimately, the selection of this sample was inherently limited and subjective, and this review should not be interpreted as exhaustive. For analysis, the sources were entered into Taguette, a free and open-source software for coding qualitative research. Using Taguette, the entire sample was coded for patterns and organized into the takeaways described herein. It is worth noting that while progressing through the sample quasi-randomly (alphabetically by the primary author’s last name), we reached 96% code saturation (i.e. 53 of the eventual 55 codes were identified) roughly halfway through the sample, and by the final quarter of the sample, new insights enriching these codes were infrequent (i.e.meaning saturation).","text",2
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","We therefore feel reasonably satisfied with the scope of our sample.","text",3
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","While the number of studies is smaller than we originally anticipated, the range of the sample is quite broad. It includes many surveys, some qualitative studies involving interviews and focus groups, three systematic reviews, and a number of psychological experiments. It includes studies conducted by animal ag industry organizations and university departments of ag science; animal advocacy organizations and animal rights-motivated researchers at universities; and relatively neutral third-party agencies such as Gallup, Pew, and Consumer Reports. Areas of study include: A few patterns are apparent just from looking at a high-level summary of the sample. First of all, apart from occasional isolated questions on mainstream surveys, the vast majority of the sample comes from researchers who are clearly on one side or the other of the battle over animal farming. 39 of the studies in our sample were from animal advocates or others who were clearly motivated to reduce or eliminate animal agriculture, while 8 were from industry-aligned researchers, and those numbers only address researchers who made no attempt to mask their interests. Most (14) of the remainder comprises surveys by Pew, Gallup, or Consumer Reports which are sometimes tangential to the issues concerned in this report. There were some clear differences between studies done from an industry vs. a movement perspective, and the relative paucity of third-party research may represent a weakness in the entire sample. Nonetheless, several patterns are consistent across research regardless of whether it is sponsored by the industry or the movement. Second, the large majority of research into this topic is quantitative surveys which provide only a relatively superficial and sometimes confusing insight into the public’s views. For instance, a majority of people who self-report as vegetarian or vegan also indicate that they ate meat in the last two days. Researchers have presented several possible explanations.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","We found the qualitative studies (e.g. involving focus groups or longer interviews) in our sample to be rich with insight; we were left with the impression that investing greater resources in qualitative public opinion research would be very fruitful for animal advocates.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","Overall, we found less research than we expected to find. We also found very little research which asked similar questions to ours: namely, research into the frames, metaphors, and values that ordinary members of the public use to interpret messages about animal rights, animal farming, and slaughter-free food. While this review yielded countless useful insights for crafting a memorable, persuasive message, it also laid bare the need for a deep, qualitative investigation of the complex thought processes underpinning Americans’ opinion of animal farming. Interestingly, the studies in our sample which shed the most light on these thought processes were two methodologically identical studies by separate industry-aligned researchers10Cardoso, C.

In these two studies, samples of ~300 Americans each were asked a single open-ended question: “What do you consider to be an ideal dairy farm and why are these characteristics important to you?” (In the second study, participants were asked about pig farms.) This simple open-ended question sufficed to draw out a great deal of information about the values and beliefs that govern people’s thinking about animal farming, as discussed below. This simple, low-cost qualitative study presents an intriguing model for further qualitative research into public psychology and perceptions, one we hope other movement-aligned researchers might pursue further. Finally, our sample includes a small number of unpublished surveys by movement-aligned researchers. We were given access to these studies but asked not to share them.","text",6

There are a few helpful ways to categorize people according to their views and concerns around meat, but as a whole, the population can be described as deeply ambivalent. While meat eating is ubiquitous, decades of advocacy have disseminated enough information into the public that meat “can simultaneously be deeply popular as well as troubling among the same people.”11Chiles, R. M. (2016). Hidden in Plain Sight: How Industry, Mass Media, and Consumers’ Everyday Habits Suppress Food Controversies. Sociologia Ruralis, 57, 791–815. Most people work hard to avoid thinking about slaughter On one hand, the perceived universality of meat consumption makes it difficult for consumers to question. Statements like “meat is good for you because everybody like[s] meat“ demonstrate how meat eating is “an ordinary and routine habit that [does] not provoke critical reflection, at least not publicly.”11Chiles, R. M. (2016). Hidden in Plain Sight: How Industry, Mass Media, and Consumers’ Everyday Habits Suppress Food Controversies. Sociologia Ruralis, 57, 791–815. At the same time, deeper studies rarely encounter people who do not have a pronounced discomfort with killing animals for food.7Busch, G., Kassas, B., Palma, M. A., & Risius, A. (2020). Perceptions of antibiotic use in livestock farming in Germany, Italy and the United States. Livestock Science, 241, 104251.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2020.10425110Cardoso, C. S., Hötzel, M.

In fact, there is a clear pattern in our research sample where short-form quantitative surveys find low public concern for animals, but longer-form qualitative interviews quickly reveal a more complicated picture: “many people who appear to accept animal farming are in fact deeply conflicted about the morality of killing animals for food.”6Bryant, C., & Barnett, J.

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","This crucial finding should be front of mind whenever considering findings from short-answer quantitative surveys; in general, we expect these surveys to underestimate opposition to (or at least discomfort with) animal farming. Robert Chiles documents some of the patterns and strategies people use to diffuse or avoid the cognitive dissonance between their consumption and this internal conflict11Chiles, R. M. (2016). Hidden in Plain Sight: How Industry, Mass Media, and Consumers’ Everyday Habits Suppress Food Controversies. Sociologia Ruralis, 57, 791–815.: Crucially, these statements show the deliberate, conscious efforts people make to avoid receiving new information about the slaughter industry or thinking about what they already know: “Jessica was well aware of the contradiction between her beliefs and everyday consumption habits, and she made efforts to resolve this tension by characterising herself in disparaging ways. At several points in the interview, she described herself as being ‘stupid’, ‘silly’, and ‘too sensitive’.” In a focus group environment, meat consumers will entertain a discussion about these contradictions for a time. Particularly interesting to advocates should be the beliefs they cite to bring an end to that conversation. These habits function as a psychological emergency release valve, and they appear to play a key role in helping consumers avoid both information about the industry and their own cognitive dissonance. One is appealing to the impossibility of change: “Yeah I could stop eating meat tomorrow but it’s not going to stop how much meat is being produced. It’s either everyone or no one…”23Happer, C. & Wellesley, L. (2019). Meat consumption, behaviour and the media environment: a focus group analysis across four countries. Food Security, 11(1), 123–139.https://doi.org/10.1007/s12571-018-0877-1 Appeals to culture and habit are also common ways to terminate the discussion.","text",10

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","Finally, many meat consumers diffuse cognitive dissonance by expressing disdain for vegans and vegetarians (veg*ns for short): characterizing them as  “sadistic,” “judgmental,” and “militant”19Earle, M., Hodson, G., Dhont, K., & MacInnis, C. (2019). Eating with our eyes (closed): Effects of visually associating animals with meat on antivegan/vegetarian attitudes and meat consumption willingness. Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, 22(6), 818–835.https://doi.org/10.1177/1368430219861848was a good enough reason not to further question meat eating. Advocates may want to further avoid labeling themselves veg*n or framing the issue in terms of veg*nism. Attachment to meat products runs deep and is not limited to taste or price The animal movement is currently significantly invested in efforts to bring the price of meat alternatives below the price of slaughtered meat while improving taste. However, existing evidence suggests that even if tasteandprice concerns could be addressed, significant hurdles would remain for alternative meat adoption. Regarding price,in a 2015 survey by Consumer Reports12Consumer Reports Survey March 12 – March 22, 2015, Question 17 (asked of subpopulation who shop for groceries), accessed through Roper iPoll, women who shop for groceries were asked: “In recent years, food costs have been on the rise. Despite higher prices, which one food item would be the last you’d cut back on buying?” The two leading choices by far were meat (29%) and dairy (26%) products. This means that at least 55% of respondents considered their animal product consumption to be somewhat independent of price fluctuations. Reaching benchmarks in taste and price may suffice to address the perception that meat eating isnecessary, but strong cultural attachments based onnaturalnessandnormalcyremain (‘We eat meat because we just plain eat meat. It’s what we do’.23Happer, C. & Wellesley, L. (2019).","text",12

Forget the rest: animal rights is political Traditionally, a number of demographic factors have been accepted as predicting higher rates of vegetarianism and meat reduction, along with greater concern for animals (what I’ll refer to as AFVB,animal-friendly views and behaviors). Women, nonwhites (especially Black), young people, urban and suburban residents, and people with a college degree are more likely to exhibit the beliefs and behaviors promoted by the animal movement, including reporting empathy and concern for animals, reducing meat consumption, and buying plant-based alternatives. As of 2020, however, following a decade of increasing political polarization and demographic political realignment, political leaning has become the strongest association with AFVB28Ladak, A. & Anthis, J.R. (2020) Animals, Food, and Technology (AFT) Survey: 2020 Update, Sentience Institute.https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aft-survey-202051Schmiess, J. (2020) Is vegetarianism/veganism growing more partisan over time? Rethink Priorities.https://www.rethinkpriorities.org/blog/2020/9/4/is-vegetarianismveganism-growing-more-partisan-over-time. When politics are accounted for, racial and regional associations are erased, and associations with gender, age, and education are reduced. This means not merely that the demographics of the Democratic party base mirror the animal movement’s supporters, but that liberal politics are the main predictor of AFVB. Pro-animal sentiments are now closely correlated with the general cultural divide creeping into so many aspects of American life. Age and gender associations were not totally erased, but were reduced. In short, the animal movement’s supporters are to be found primarily among liberals and Democrats,especiallyyoung people and women. Conservatives should not necessarily be written off.","text",14
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","Liberals are generally more than twice as likely to identify as veg*n, report meat reduction, and support a strong animal rights view. That is a large statistical association, but still means perhaps a quarter to a third of veg*ns and animal rights supporters are conservative. The animal movement may want to be careful explicitly identifying with one side or another in the broader culture war at the risk of alienating half the country, while leaning into the liberal values that promote pro-animal behavior. On the other hand, getting swept up into that war may be inevitable.","text",15
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","Conservatives are generally less empathetic towards animals and more hostile towards veg*ns, but conservatism is a state of mind Politics are the strongest predictor of pro-animal behavior, but political views are highly fluid. As discussed previously, George Lakoff’s research has shown how most people possess both liberal and conservative worldviews and can rapidly move back and forth between the two. If liberalism leads to higher AFVB, priming people with a liberal worldview may have the effect of increasing their openness to an animal freedom message. In other words, rather than crafting an appeal based on conservative values, animal advocates should focus on activating liberal values in the persuadable middle and connecting those values to animal freedom. The segment of the public which is rigidly conservative, i.e. whose agreement with conservative views is not responsive to priming or other variables, should likely not be seen as targets for the movement in the near term: conservatives are much more likely to lapse in veg*nism due to lack of social support and lack of commitment to justice motivations for veg*nism18Earle, M., & Hodson, G. (2018). Conservatism predicts lapses from vegetarian/vegan diets to meat consumption (through lower social justice concerns and social support). Appetite, 120, 75–81.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2017.08.027. Fortunately, political outlook does not seem to have an effect on consumers’ response tonudges or in-the-moment educational interventionsto reduce animal consumption. This suggests conservatives can eventually be brought around through normalization and that it may be more effective to engage with rigid conservatives as consumers rather than as voters, in an exception to the general public.","text",16
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","Furthermore, because conservatives tend to be skeptical of government intervention concerning public health, climate change, and other issues intersecting with animal agriculture, priming liberal frames may be key to driving acceptance of drastic government action.","text",17

(2015)In U.S., More Say Animals Should Have Same Rights as People,Gallup.https://news.gallup.com/poll/183275/say-animals-rights-people.aspx51Schmiess, J. (2020) Is vegetarianism/veganism growing more partisan over time? Rethink Priorities.https://www.rethinkpriorities.org/blog/2020/9/4/is-vegetarianismveganism-growing-more-partisan-over-time. Per Gallup: Women remain more likely to support [the statement “animals’ rights should be equal to those of humans’”] than men do, but support among both groups has increased by a similar amount since 2008. Similarly, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are more supportive of this view than Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are, but both groups have seen an increase from the last time Gallup asked them. The same holds true for meat reduction and veg*n identity. This fact could be especially important to communicate in light of thedynamic normsresearch discussed earlier; it follows that if conservative men hear that other conservative men have been adopting pro-animal views and behaviors, they will be less likely to resist due to social identity compatibility. 4.3Comparing Concerns Animal advocates discuss several issues in their messaging about animal farming. Animal suffering, environmental damage, and healthy eating are mentioned most frequently. Less common topics include disease transmission, antimicrobial resistance, and treatment of workers. Each of these can be discussed in a nearly endless number of ways. The research we reviewed sheds light on how the public engages with these different issues.","text",18

A majority of people say that they prioritize health over altruistic concerns like animal rights or the environment, but those health concerns rarely motivate individual action and are in fact negatively associated with support for political action. There is also evidence that health-focused ads make plant-based food alternatives less appealing57Wise, J. & Vennard, D. (2018) It’s All in a Name: How to Boost the Sales of Plant-Based Menu Items.

Few consumers can identify that antibiotic overuse leads bacteria to develop resistance through evolution to medically important antimicrobials, causing a risk of preventable human deaths. (Antimicrobial resistance is already blamed for 35,000 deaths in the U.S. annually.) While this lack of understanding does not appear to limit opposition to antibiotic use, it may explain why public support for this message does not extend to a pandemic-focused message.

After exposure to a familiar message focused on animal suffering, the public reports that advocates are honest and trustworthy, while accusations of opportunism or dishonesty regularly come in response to environmental arguments as well. This doesn’t mean it isn’t worthwhile to educate the public about pandemic and environmental links to animal farming; rather, advocates should be aware that these messages require much more explanation and are essentially in an education stage, whereas messages focused on animal suffering or antibiotics and hormones are already salient among the public. Advocates who mention pandemic and environmental links in passing without providing a robust, causal explanation of those links risk being seen as unreliable.","text",29

In recent studies by movement actors testing messages on all these topics and more, standard animal-centered messages performed the highest for building opposition to the industry, support for movement goals, and trust in animal advocates.17Dullaghan, N., Davis, M., Hurford, P., Moss, D. (2021). Rethink Priorities Poll: U.S. Farming Policy. Rethink Priorities. This is probably due in part to the public’s familiarity with animal cruelty messaging. Research participants focused greatly on one aspect of animal welfare: having enough space to act out natural behaviors was the “most frequently noted characteristic” of a good farm.10Cardoso, C.

In one unpublished survey, messages focusing on mistreatment of farm workers and contract farmers performed well. We feel this message merits further investigation. Some research participants did occasionally mention government and corporate corruption in the animal farming industry.11Chiles, R. M. (2016). Hidden in Plain Sight: How Industry, Mass Media, and Consumers’ Everyday Habits Suppress Food Controversies. Sociologia Ruralis, 57, 791–815. This was another example of contradictory thinking, which some consumers, to their credit, were able to notice. On one hand, “their lack of personal exposure to meat safety problems led them to extrapolate that their go-to companies were legitimate, trustworthy, and socially responsible on a broad array of issues.” At the same time, they feel that without other options, they have no choice but to trust meat companies, leaving them with some discomfort. They also assume that large meat companies are buying government influence23Happer, C. & Wellesley, L. (2019).

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","A golden thread: thenaturalness/disgustframe As research participants discussed all of these different concerns across the studies we examined, a pattern emerged indicating fundamental differences between how the public, as opposed to experts, understand animal farming and its associated problems. We called this pattern thenaturalness/disgustframe. For experts who have spent years familiarizing themselves with facts about the harms caused by animal agriculture, it can be difficult to understand how people with very limited exposure react to those same facts. Experts (including animal advocates) think in terms of causal chains that often involve trade-offs, for instance: While these chains are linked and cofounded in important ways, they are also distinct in important ways. In other words, experts see animal agriculture as a complex system shaped by the decisions of government and industry actors, with specific practices leading to specific harms that matter for different reasons. The public does not view animal agriculture in this way. While a quarter to a third of the public (thebase) are more or less receptive to adopting the expert model, a supermajority of people are rooted in a much simpler one. In this information-poor model, all of the aforementioned causal chains are collapsed into a single distinction: there is anaturalway to produce meat, and there is anunnatural, disgustingway to do it. This mental model is an extension of the Small Family Farm/Large Industrial Farm framework, with SFFs and LIFs acting as conceptual peg boards onto which specific real or imaginary animal farming practices are hung. Thenaturalproduction model is everything most people say when asked to describe an ideal animal farm. Where animal welfare is concerned, the emphasis is on animals being able to act out their natural behavior, with lots of space and access to the outdoors. Hormones are unheard of and antibiotics are only used on individual sick animals.","text",34

It is large, crowded, and filthy, and relies heavily on chemicals. Animals are treated like machines. While the public does not mention some of the most graphic scenes often found in farms (such as cannibalism), in other ways their image of the unnatural animal farm is exaggerated: From the research we reviewed, it appears that thenaturalness/disgustframe is the primary lens most people use to view animal farming. People rely on this frame to make sense of the two issues they most commonly raise in association with animal farming: animal welfare, and overuse of antibiotics and hormones. While people work hard to avoid talking about slaughter (leaving us with less data about how people conceptually relate to slaughter), we suspect that disgust is the primary emotion people feel in response to animal slaughter and that there is great potential to generate opposition to animal slaughter by framing it as unnatural. It makes sense that disgust should be a potent weapon in a cultural struggle over food. Disgust is intimately tied to food choice, and it may have evolved primarily in connection to food choice to protect omnivorous human ancestors from eating unsafe food, particularly carrion.53Tybur, J.

A well-crafted message using thenaturalness/disgustframe could therefore simultaneously build political support and immediately impact consumer choices. Of course, intentionally or not, animal advocates have already been activating thenaturalness/disgustframe with their animal cruelty messages.","text",37
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","However, thenaturalness/disgustframe is a double-edged sword for animal advocates: many people use this same frame to assess high-tech meat alternatives, especially cultivated meat, and it appears to be the leading source of resistance. If advocates determine that adoption of cultivated meat is important for the eventual elimination of animal farming, they should wield thenaturalness/disgustframe with care. 4.4Meat Reduction & Alternatives Understanding what drives existing meat reduction trends may be crucial to accelerating those trends. Meat alternatives in particular represent an evolving front in the animal movement’s messaging campaign. Around 11 of the studies in our sample (or 1 in 6) investigated public perception of meat alternatives specifically. On the whole, they found hopeful as well as concerning signals about the public’s willingness to adopt meat alternatives and what else is driving meat reduction among Americans. The “rise of veganism” is actually the rise of reducetarianism In the early phases of the current research, we found that advocates, journalists, and research participants all described the “rise of veganism,” apparently referring to the sense that veg*nism has achieved an unprecedented level of social momentum in recent years. Yet surveys find little or no increase in the number of Americans who identify as vegetarian or vegan.43Reinhart, R.J. (2018) Snapshot: Few Americans Vegetarian or Vegan.

The number of people whodon’tidentify as veg*n but say they havenoteaten meat in the last two days also increased over the same period. This provides further evidence that the momentum of “veganism” is due to people reducing (but not eliminating) their meat consumption, with some of these meat reducers identifying as veg*n. Consistent with prior discussion, meat reducers tend to be Democrats, women, and people of color. 70% list health as a major reason; 41% list animal welfare.

There is a stark difference between the public’s favorable views of the animal movement and their negative views of veg*ns. The rhetoric of veg*nism activates and reinforces the consumer frame, where strong values of personal choice and autonomy override concern for animals. Where possible, the movement should not present itself as composed of veg*ns or advocating veg*nism. As we discuss below, a story about people of all diets coming together to push for dramatic legislative change is both more inspiring and more accessible. Advocates should also work hard to elevate the racial and gender diversity of the movement, without coming across as desperate or pandering.

In the aforementioned study showing that learning about high-tech meat alternatives reduces animal farming opposition, the author wondered whether the cause was that consumers exposed to the technology “think the ethical and environmental problems of animal farming will be solved anyway.”24Harris, J.

They hope that by increasing the public’s understanding of why these practices were adopted, they can win back public support. Research suggests that these efforts are having a more complicated effect: “Farmers have argued that the lay public lacks information and familiarity with pig farming issues, and therefore have unrealistic opinions.

Visitors were also significantly more likely than the general population to agree that “castration (neutering) of male pigs, confining hogs indoors, using farrowing and gestation crates, housing sows in group pens, ear notching for identification, tail docking and teeth clipping seriously reduced the animal welfare of pigs.” There were some trends in the opposite direction. For instance, farm visitors were more likely to believe two false views about animal welfare in modern agriculture: that pigs are treated with antibiotics only when sick, and that most pigs in the U.S. are raised on farms with less than 100 total pigs. The data suggests farm visits increase support for animal farming among a minority, but decrease it overall. We hypothesize that the effect of the visit is dependent on the individual’s predisposition, as we discuss in the section below on base, opposition, and persuadables. For now, this belies a tentative hypothesis we had that oversaturation of animal cruelty footage had reduced the efficacy of information exposure. We have not seen any evidence that being presented with too much information, or the ‘wrong’ information, reduces long-term support for the movement’s goals.","text",50

However, we would like to establish the backlash effect of agritourism with greater certainty before making this recommendation.","text",51
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","Standard practices are repellant; extraordinary cases are confusing With undercover investigations, animal advocates often focus on superfluous cases of violence, especially workers assaulting animals. Research suggests this may be both unnecessary and counterproductive. First, considerable evidence shows that the public is sufficiently turned off by the industry’s standard practices. Crowding, confinement indoors, and the act of slaughter itself are all disturbing for the general public. In fact, industry-aligned researchers in our sample repeatedly reached the conclusion that efforts by the industry to educate the public about these practices would backfire. For instance, visitors to an agritourism destination depicting modern pig and dairy cow practices were significantly more likely to report having reduced meat consumption in the last three years due to animal welfare concerns or to describe themselves as vegetarian or vegan16Cummins, A., Widmar, N. O., Croney, C., Fulton, J. (2015). Perceptions of United States Residents: Animal Agriculture and Meat Products. Center for Animal Welfare Science at Purdue University RP.2015-04. Visitors were also significantly more likely than the general population to agree that practices demonstrated on the farm such as “castration (neutering) of male pigs, confining hogs indoors, using farrowing and gestation crates, housing sows in group pens, ear notching for identification, tail docking and teeth clipping seriously reduced the animal welfare of pigs.” In the words of industry researchers reflecting on their own findings: If standard industry practices are enough to repel a large portion of the public, many of the superfluous abuses documented by animal activists have the opposite effect.","text",52

Our sample corroborates this pattern and extends it to animal cruelty on farms in particular: “The infrequency and fragmentation of certain article categories can lead people to assume that well-publicised labour [sic], environmental, animal welfare, and food safety issues are unusual events rather than symptoms of broader problems.”11Chiles, R.

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","The following exchange with a focus group participant is representative: Q: So what sort of led you to the conclusion that most farms are responsible or proper? A: I guess I really don’t have any facts on it. I could probably look up some. I feel more – You don’t hear that much about farms. You’d hear about it on the news, if farms were something completely unpractical, like torturing an animal. I feel like you’d definitely hear about that on the news. But for how much meat is processed every day and how many animals are slaughtered every day, it’s kind of bad sounding. But you don’t really hear that much. . . I feel like it would be a huge deal if companies were just killing and – Like if they found out. . . it would be all over the news: ‘Companies were killing immorally’. Q: So it’s sort of like the fact that maybe once a year you’ll see on the news like undercover video or something, ‘workers abusive’ or something like that. If that was coming out every day, maybe it would be more widespread? A: Oh yeah. That would be way, I would probably have a way different opinion on eating meat. Happening every day, that would be awful, torturing animals. Like once a year, I feel like is definitely, once or twice a year is definitely manageable. Because that really means that no one really does it. Especially if there was more publicity on it. This suggests that the industry has an effective response when it claims that abuses revealed by an undercover investigation are isolated incidents. As we discuss in the next report in this series, the media often credulously repeats this argument. While advocates insist that these abuses are in fact widespread, the very way they conduct and release these investigations provides the industry with an effective rebuttal and functions to obscure many of the standard industry practices the public already finds repellant.","text",54
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","Because these abuses are often superfluous to the production process, viewers can be repelled by them while at the same time comforting themselves that most farms produce meat without those particular kinds of violence. This may even have the effect of making otherwise repellant industry practices seem more tolerable by comparison. Meanwhile, crowding, indoor confinement, and slaughter are all inextricable features of modern animal agriculture which alone could suffice to turn the public further against the industry.","text",55
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","Overall, this suggests that advocates focused on public opinion should take aim at common practices the industry itself admits to, rather than abuses which go above and beyond those standards. Even when the industry presents these practices on its own terms, the public is repelled. Advocates should target these structurally necessary practices to challenge the very legitimacy of animal farming. Advocates must also help the public see these as persistent issues rather than intermittent ones. Transparency represents a catch-22 for animal farmers As evidence accumulates that “educational efforts by the agricultural industries to bring public views in line with industry practices will not be successful,”8Busch, G., Weary, D. M., Spiller, A., & von Keyserlingk, M. A. (2017). American and German attitudes towards cow-calf separation on dairy farms. PLOS ONE, 12(3).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0174013proponents of animal farming are faced with a dilemma: learning about ag-gag laws significantly reduces the public’s general trust in farmers, enough to shift the public from an overall attitude of trust towards one of distrust, as well as increasing support for animal welfare regulations.46Robbins, J. A., Franks, B., Weary, D. M., & von Keyserlingk, M. A. G. (2016). Awareness of ag-gag laws erodes trust in farmers and increases support for animal welfare regulations.Food Policy,61, 121–125.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2016.02.008This loss of trust in farmers occurs across demographics, including those otherwise most trusting and supportive of animal farming. Additionally, “awareness of ag-gag laws negatively impacted perceptions of the current status of farm animal welfare as well as the perception that farmers do a good job of protecting the environment.” Ag-gag laws appear to be a potent messaging tool for animal advocates; the fact that most people remain unaware of them only means there is greater potential to build support through education around them.","text",56

We hypothesize that these patterns can be organized into three categories: the base, the persuadables, and the opposition. This model explains what would otherwise be strange contradictions in some of the research in our sample. Importantly, these segments respond to different stimuli in different ways. Neutral (i.e. non-activist) exposure to modern animal farming practices may lead one group to be more comfortable with those practices, while at the same time drawing condemnation from another.16Cummins, A., Widmar, N. O., Croney, C., Fulton, J. (2015). Perceptions of United States Residents: Animal Agriculture and Meat Products. Center for Animal Welfare Science at Purdue University RP.2015-04 In many cases, these patterns are more useful to advocates than variables such as liberalism, gender, and age. While liberalism is strongly associated with pro-animal beliefs and behaviors, many of these associations are still marginal, and many liberals do not belong to the animal movement’s base, while a nontrivial number of conservatives do. The large majority belong to the persuadable middle. We discuss the features of these three categories and the implications for messaging. The Base The base are the people who agree with the strong animal rights view that “animals deserve the exact same rights as people to be free from harm and exploitation.” They make up between 25% and 32% of the population.25Hopwood, C. J., Bleidorn, W., Schwaba, T., & Chen, S. (2020). Health, environmental, and animal rights motives for vegetarian eating.

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","The base is differentiated by a definable set of values. These values inform their priorities concerning animal farming and lead them to respond differently to advocate messages. The following values appeared in association with pro-animal views in studies from both industry and advocate perspectives3Beggs, A. T., & Anderson, J. (2021, April 14). Beliefs About Chickens And Fish & Their Relation To Animal-Positive Behaviors. Faunalytics.https://faunalytics.org/chicken-and-fish-1/.7Busch, G., Kassas, B., Palma, M. A., & Risius, A. (2020).

The base relates to the issue of animal farming altruistically. Though they consider their health important, they list animal rights and the environment as the most compelling reasons to consider a vegetarian diet, and list health as third.25Hopwood, C.

PLOS ONE, 15(4).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230609and respond similarly to advocate messages. The differences between them should not be exaggerated. The Opposition The opposition are a small minority who are obstinately resistant or actively hostile to the animal movement’s goals. With dismissive views such as “animals don’t need much protection… because they are just animals,” the opposition makes up as little as 3% of the population45Riffkin, R.

Even adynamic normsmessage will likely have little or no effect on the opposition, due to their social environment occupied by other late adopters and laggards; for the foreseeable future, their lived social experience will belie any claim that meat reduction and vegetarianism are becoming the default. The Persuadable Middle The persuadable middle is not a cohesive unit and, as such, cannot be characterized by any shared values. Instead, it should be understood as the remainder left over between the base and the opposition: people who have not engaged with the issue enough to take a position, or whose values do not predispose them towards one position or the other. As with most other political issues64Haney-López Ian. (2019). Merge left: Fusing race and class, winning elections, and Saving America. The New Press., the vast majority (between 62% and 75%) of the population falls into this middle category whose relationship to the issue of animal farming is best described as indifferent. When asked, these persuadables reveal complex, contradictory, disorganized beliefs about the issue, in part because they haven’t thought much about it before: Never really thought about meat like this in-depth though – it’s kinda cool thinking about something so much in your life that you never thought about before – It’s kinda weird thinking about – I’ve never got this much in depth of something I eat literally almost every day...

Crucially, this does not mean that they consider it to be particularly persuasive, merely the most persuasive of the three reasons25Hopwood, C. J., Bleidorn, W., Schwaba, T., & Chen, S. (2020). Health, environmental, and animal rights motives for vegetarian eating. PLOS ONE, 15(4).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230609. Though they are repelled by many realities of modern animal farming, the persuadables have yet to be persuaded that veg*nism or meat reduction are worthy of their attention. Additionally, the views of the persuadables should not be seen as static. On one hand, this group is much less receptive than the base to animal advocates’ current messaging. On the other, they have invested very little thought into the issue, and their views are not well formed, a fact most of them are quick to admit. Messaging across categories Often, messages can be targeted to a particular audience, but sometimes it is desirable to have a message which can be put in front of the general public. In that case, an effective message should excite the base, persuade the middle, and antagonize the opposition.64Haney-López Ian. (2019). Merge left: Fusing race and class, winning elections, and Saving America. The New Press.The opposition is essentially unreachable, but provoking a strong backlash from a small minority can heighten the tension around an issue, attracting attention and making advocates seem reasonable, thus propelling moderates toward them.

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","The base is stirred by altruistic messaging focusing on animal suffering (especially the act of slaughter and the confinement of animals in unnaturally small spaces) or social harms from animal farming. What kind of message could move the persuadables? New research demonstrates some promising leads. The persuadables are not motivated by altruism in relation to animal farming, and health is not a compelling motivator for individual or political action.Disgust, however, is a visceral emotion closely tied to food choice which has been shown to affect many consumers who are otherwise indifferent to animal advocate messages. Thedynamic normsstrategy discussed earlier may also be particularly effective on the persuadables.

Animal-related beliefs and values We were particularly interested in identifying the language the public themselves use to rationalize their support for the animal movement’s goals. The following is typical of the public’s vocabulary when discussing animal protection2Anderson, J. (2019, October 30). The People Who Support Animal Causes: Descriptive Results.

American Citizens’ Views of an Ideal Pig Farm. Animals, 7(12), 64.https://doi.org/10.3390/ani7080064: Additionally, the following beliefs about animals, especially particular species, were most strongly correlated with support for the movement’s goals3Beggs, A.

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","While we think advocates would do well to continue with these appeals, this research also suggests some relatively novel appeals are underutilized:personalityandbeauty. The attribution ofpersonalityhad a particularly strong correlation to movement support. Advocates could focus more on the unique personalities of individual animals from the farming industry. We also highlight the difference between attributing intelligence to animals and believing they are “more intelligent than people give them credit for;” the latter implies that our current relationship to animals does not reflect their actual intelligence, and as such needs to be changed.","text",69
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","An interesting topic of further research would be whether thebeautybelief is connected to thenaturalness/disgustframe. If so, depicting animals as beautiful beings in their natural habitat could be a poignant disgust-generating foil to the way animals are used in farms. Rightsandwelfareparadigms don’t reflect public thinking While a minority describe “animal rights” as a more radical orientation, for most people, the phrases “animal rights,” “animal welfare,” and “animal protection” imply basically the same thing.4Broad, G. M. (2020). Using Focus Groups to Explore Public Perceptions of Legal Rights for Animals. Anthrozoös, 33(5), 613–627.https://doi.org/10.1080/08927936.2020.1799548 Overall, the research suggests that the public’s mental model does not resemble either the conventional “rights” or the conventional “welfare” model particularly closely. On one hand, some rights language is confusing and distracting. Legal rights jargon (e.g. “nonhuman animal, bodily liberty, and bodily autonomy”) is criticized as “unclear and overly academic,” and conjures images of “an elephant in a civil court room” and slippery-slope scenarios whereby keeping dogs and cats would be tantamount to slavery.4Broad, G. M. (2020). Using Focus Groups to Explore Public Perceptions of Legal Rights for Animals. Anthrozoös, 33(5), 613–627.https://doi.org/10.1080/08927936.2020.1799548 On the other hand, the public finds corporate welfare campaigns uninspiring at best. They are incredulous that seemingly small changes to farming practices should take years to implement, and essentially reject advocates’ assertion that these changes are a productive step in the right direction. In the words of a movement-aligned researcher, “a significant group of people do not accept the premise of cagefree campaigns improving welfare for hens.”1Anderson, J. (2020, January 23).","text",70

(2016) Welfare Reforms and Meat Consumption.https://mercyforanimals.org/blog/welfare-reforms-survey/Research in our sample investigated public support for a broad range of laws, from the moderate (requiring labels for antibiotics) to the radical (outlawing slaughterhouses or animal farming completely). Unsurprisingly, there is greater support for less drastic legal changes, but support is encouragingly high across the board. Advocates should be aware that public support for drastic legal changes is high, and should identify appropriately ambitious legal targets in order to gain the public’s respect and attention. Such campaigns also provide an accessible ask for the public. More people are willing to sign a petition calling for greater regulation of animal agriculture than are willing to change their diet. We suspect that the same would hold true for a more ambitious petition given the high degree of support (48%) some surveys found for banning slaughterhouses.28Ladak, A. & Anthis, J.R.

It is almost like vegetarianism and, you know, veganism is something you can afford.”23Happer, C. & Wellesley, L. (2019).

Voting is an important way Americans engage with issues outside of the consumer frame. Engaging with the public asvotersrather than asconsumershelps them think systemically and see a role for the government in solving problems. To promote systemic, political thinking, advocates should refer to the public as voters and make asks which activate a voter frame (e.g. signing an official petition, calling their representatives) rather than consumer asks (boycotting a company or changing their diet). This analysis does not address the strategic merit of campaigns to change laws, only their efficacy for public messaging. Some government actions are more popular than others In general (that is, not concerning animal farming) the public tends to be least supportive of policies they view as restrictive. Instead, they prefer the government to make more information available to consumers, and to invest in and subsidize good behaviors.21aAubrun, A., Brown, A., & Grady, J.

Between one third and one half of Americans support a ban on slaughterhouses even as they understand that such a ban would make meat unavailable.28Ladak, A. & Anthis, J.R.

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","Using subsidies to encourage transformation has higher support, ranging from 60% to 80% depending on the policy.61Yale University/George Mason University Politics & Global Warming Survey, December 3 - December 16, 2020, 1036 adults nationally, accessed through Roper iPollThe public perceives the government as having near-limitless resources and a very small minority is concerned about the cost of policies they support. However, there was evidence of affirmation bias in relevant samples, with a surprising 47% in favor of “expanding offshore drilling for oil and natural gas off the United States coast.” Advocates may want to consider stacking these policy demands. High support suggests it is not too early for advocates to be forthcoming about their ultimate goal of ending animal agriculture. Doing so may be seen as honest and increase trust in advocates. Naming a popular intermediate policy goal (such as one involving redirection of government funds) at the same time may serve to further reduce opposition. Images cut straight to the heart (and stomach) Several studies investigated the effects of different kinds of imagery on concern for animals and desire to eat meat. In particular, some studies demonstrated the ability of images to reinforce certain frames and associations, and especially to directly influence visceral emotions such as disgust. Two visual strategies were particularly effective for activating disgust towards meat: reinforcing the connection between animals and meat, and between meat and filth. Simply picturing an animal alongside images of meat (as opposed to images of meat alone) significantly reduces people’s desire to eat meat, specifically by increasing their empathy for animals and their distress about killing animals for meat.19Earle, M., Hodson, G., Dhont, K., & MacInnis, C.

Importantly, the images used in two studies (examples shown below) were at least neutral depictions of both meat and animals; it would be easy to imagine seeing these images in a meat advertisement. This is further evidence that disgust for meat and slaughter is just underneath the surface and can be rapidly mobilized to decrease attachment to meat.","text",77

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/a-review-of-contemporary-research-into-public-perceptions-of-the-slaughter-industry/","Animal advocates often depict animals, in both favorable (e.g. sanctuaries) and unfavorable conditions (e.g. factory farms). However, advocate materials do not frequently picture meat. Indeed, many animal advocates use language intentionally chosen not to connect animals with meat. This research suggests that the meat-animal connection is a locus of significant discomfort for consumers, such that even a neutral reminder can elicit significant distress. In that case, advocates should be more willing to describe and depict meat. Further research could compare the effect of meat-animal reminders using happy vs. distressed animal images and appetizing vs. unappetizing meat images. More disgusting images may have a stronger effect, or they may be seen as hyperbolic. Another study placed images of food items alongside images meant to alert participants to the presence of dangerous pathogens: “an infected boil, an infected toe, a toilet covered with bodily wastes, or a pile of vomit.”53Tybur, J. M., Laakasuo, M., Ruff, J., & Klauke, F. (2016). How pathogen cues shape impressions of foods: the omnivore's dilemma and functionally specialized conditioning. Evolution and Human Behavior, 37(5), 376–386.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2016.03.002Consistent with the evolutionary role of disgust in helping omnivores avoid contaminated food, and the much greater risk of contamination from carcass than plant matter, these images had a negative effect on participants' desire to eat meat, but not vegetables. These images may also have a role to play in advocates’ visual messaging. Because they activate subconscious associations and visceral feelings, pathogen cues could even be compatible with a message overtly focused on animal suffering.","text",86

Avoid describing food as “vegan” (reads asdifferent from me), “healthy” (unsatisfying), or “meat-free” (less of what I like).57Wise, J. & Vennard, D. (2018) It’s All in a Name: How to Boost the Sales of Plant-Based Menu Items. World Resources Institute.https://www.wri.org/insights/its-all-name-how-boost-sales-plant-based-menu-items 5.Conclusion The research in our sample supports some of the messaging strategies advocates currently use, challenges others, and points towards some promising new ones. Animal suffering remains the most salient issue connected to meat and animal farming. Most Americans are more distressed by this suffering than they let on, and there are many things advocates can do to activate that distress, such as using images to viscerally remind people that meat comes from animals. Advocates should leverage the disgust people have with modern animal farming to turn them against it. Understanding how the base, persuadables, and opposition respond differently to messages can help advocates move each group in the right direction. A single narrative can appeal to the altruistic side of the base, activate disgust in the persuadables, and provoke a productive backlash from the opposition. Finally, this report highlights several unanswered questions for further research, by this team and others. Next report in series. 6.Publications Reviewed Other Citations 64. Haney-López Ian.

"https://paxfauna.org/needs-consciousness-for-better-conflicts/","This series is an attempt to put the content of Eva’s NVC trainings online into a readable format. This blog will cover preliminary concepts in Nonviolent Communication, which will help in understanding later blogs in this series. Part One coveredwhy we study nonviolenceand Part Two covered thepractice of empathy. The Gist: Feelings and Needs We know about feelings. They come in many shades of sad, glad, mad, scared, and disgusted. When introducing this concept in the workshop, I like to ask people to guess my feelings such as from when described my petitioning experience in the last blog: “I was petitioning the other day and someone said they eat meat and want to keep eating meat. I gave a response to him but he walked away without acknowledging it. I feel so frustrated with how little some people seem to engage.” It’s easy to name a feeling when I already did! “Try offering that one back to me,” I’ll say to the workshop participants. Our conversation might sound something like this. “I hear how frustrating that was.” “Yeah, itwasfrustrating. I hate that ‘gotcha’ thing where they act like I was saying something that isn’t true.” The feeling was frustration, but what about my need underlying that feeling? My response in the dialogue above might point you toward what was important to me in this situation. I wanted respect, perhaps, or a sense of being seen. Also calledvalues,this is the concept of universal human needs in NVC. Needs Needs might take a little more work to understand. To do so, let’s talk about babies. I want to use a baby as an example here because babies come out and they’re mostly just a little pile of need for the first bit. What do babies need? Babies need food. They need to be changed—kept clean. They need care and love, which comes in the form of physical contact, attention, and interaction. Interaction is really important for them to have mental stimulation and learning, too. Attention is really important to keep them safe.","text",3
"https://paxfauna.org/needs-consciousness-for-better-conflicts/","So, in summary, we could say that the needs of a baby includenourishment,cleanliness,care,physical contact,attention, and so on—and the baby will keep needing these same things throughout their life.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/needs-consciousness-for-better-conflicts/","There are specific strategies to meet these needs for babies. For example, their own mothers’ milk is a great strategy to meet their needs for food, and choosing this strategy over another can meet other needs as well. But spoken as generally as I listed above, weallhave the same needs as babies. If I can have a felt sense of what someone is feeling and needing, then I can have empathy for that person. If someone else can feel that empathy, then we’re in connection. What needs aren’t When I’m guessing your needs, I’m guessing what needs are alive in you, not what you’re supposed to do or receive. The important distinction is that I’m not giving you advice; I’m letting you know that I hear you. For example, if you’re feeling lonely, you might have a need for companionship, love, safety, or to be appreciated. You don’t have a need to invite a friend over to watch a movie, even if that’s astrategythat would meet your needs. You also don’t have a need to have more or better friends, even if these are the only strategies you can think of that would meet your needs. And to give you empathy, I don’t need to know what strategy is going to work for you—I simply need to let you know that I hear your need for connection. Needs vs Strategies Another way to get the concept of needs is to ask, “What is the need here that I want for everyone in the world?” If my strategy is to invite a friend over to watch a movie, I surely don’t expect everyone in the world to have that same friend over to watch a movie tonight. What about having more or better friends? Some people keep to themselves more than I do, so I wouldn’t want them to have as many close friends as I want if that’s not something that would actually satisfy them. Thus, this discussion reveals the needs that would be met by the strategies I’m considering. Companionship, care, love, and appreciation are things that Idowant for every single person in the world- this qualifies them as needs.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/needs-consciousness-for-better-conflicts/","The important thing about this distinction is that identifying needs allows us to fully hear people in what’s important to them. By separating needs from strategies, we can break through adversarial dynamics and start out on the same side.I want you to have your needs met, even if I disagree with your strategies.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/needs-consciousness-for-better-conflicts/","By starting with needs consciousness, we can be open to creative strategies that could meet everyone’s needs. How to make needs sound less awkward But Eva,you protest,that sounds so weird. I’m never going to ask my friend if they have a need for connection when they invite me over to watch a movie. I’m never going to suggest that a fellow activist who has an idea I don’t like is trying to meet their need for purpose and meaning. You’re suggesting that we talk like robots! Some people useneeds listswhen studying NVC. These lists can be helpful in learning how to identify and name different needs. I sometimes avoid using them, though, because I worry that the vocabulary in them doesn’t feel natural. If these words don’t land for you either, express them however you want. I want everyone in the world to have someoneget where they’re coming from, toknow that there are people who give a shit about them, tohave hangout time, and tohave space to do their own thing. Needs are needs even if they’re not put that way on a list. Feelings In NVC parlance, feelings are emotions or body sensations that give us feedback about our needs. That is, feelings and needs are always related. Feelings are often categorized intopleasant(relating to needs that are met) andunpleasant- (relating to needs that aren’t met). How feelings can go wrong Feelings might feel overly intimate to guess at right away, especially in conflict. If someone guesses a feeling that is too vulnerable for us, it feels bad. We might worry that they’re trying to manipulate or diagnose us. In these cases—conflict that feels adversarial, formal settings like work—a less heavy feeling might make for a better guess. If your first guess isangry,maybe the one you say out loud isa little frustrated.Another option is to skip feelings altogether.Having just the need reflected back can be enough, without the emotional weight of asking someone to acknowledge their feelings.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/needs-consciousness-for-better-conflicts/","Feelings are also differentiated fromfaux feelings—words that are phrased like feelings, but contain more information about what happened than how the speaker is feeling. For example, if I say that I’m feelingjudged,what I’m really saying is that someone is judging me. If I say I’m feelingbetrayedit contains a story about someone betraying me. Same with others, liketaken for granted, violated, insulted,andattacked.Using these words might result in defensiveness from the person you’re talking to; it’ll be harder for them to hear how you’re feeling when they’re distracted by a desire to defend themselves from an accusation of wrongdoing.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/needs-consciousness-for-better-conflicts/","Faux feelings may also lead to right/wrong thinking in those you’re going to for support, sowing the seeds for allegiances and conflict of their own down the road. Big Caveat! I feel nervous when I talk about faux feelings because I worry that given only this concept, we can leave an NVC training much more obnoxious than when we entered. I’m discussing faux feelings here to suggest thatyou,thereader, avoid them, especially during conflicts. Whenother peopleuse the language of faux feelings, please don’t correct their language, but instead translate what you are hearing them say into pure feelings and needs. Then, you can check with them that you understood correctly. Or, you can simply use this silent translation to avoid a defensive response, yourself. Forget Faux Feelings Roxy Manningredefined these asfusion wordsinstead offaux feelings.This is because these terms have a lot of useful information in them. If someone shares a fusion word with you, you have a wonderful opportunity to make an empathy guess. For instance,unwantedcontains a story that nobody likes you. If our partner comes to us feelingunwanted,we can notice that we might feel tempted to argue.That’s not true! I love you, I was just busy yesterday!But, now that we know about fusion words, we might choose to make another choice first: to reflect a feeling or need that might be alive for our partner in that moment. We might instead choose to say, “I’m guessing it was really sad for you when I wasn’t home by the time I said I would be, and you’re wanting more of a sense of care from me?” When we use fusion words to express our own feelings, they might be more likely to cue defensiveness because they contain a story about the other person's intentions. They might also be more likely to cue defensiveness inus, when we hear them. Let's do a little bit of practice translating these into feelings and needs guesses.","text",9

"https://paxfauna.org/needs-consciousness-for-better-conflicts/","Blamed- Are you feeling hurt and wanting a sense of trust, understanding, or acceptance? Tricked- Is there some shock up for you? Or some confusion? Would it be nice to have a sense that you’re on the same team? Manipulated- Would it be nice to have acknowlegment of disgust? Are you so wanting trust in this situation? Judged- Are you feeling angry? Would it be nice to have a sense that you’re accepted exactly as you are? Taken for granted- Is there some alienation? Is there a need up for appreciation? But blame feels amazing! It does. Go ahead, try it. Think of a conflict in your life and imagine telling the person, “I feel ____ and it’s your fault.” You might use one of the abovefaux feelingsfor this. Notice the sense of righteousness in your body. Empathy is a gentler satisfaction that feels less like less of a rush. It’s a release of tension, a sense of relaxation, or a shift in what feels important about the situation. The hope here is that a practice of empathy, for yourself and others, can help us to access this more sustainable satisfaction. This can mean replacing the roller coaster of blame with something more sustainable for our own emotional health and the health of our relationships. If you found this discussion interesting, stay tuned for the next piece where we’ll exploreobservations and requests. We will learn how to untangle objective observations from blame-tinged assessment and begin the practice of NVC requests.

Introduction & Key Recommendations The FrameWorks Institute (whose methods heavily informed this report) recently publishednew researchexamining the change in Americans’ thinking over time, specifically individualistic vs. systemic thinking. FrameWorks found promising signs that Americans’ capacity for systemic thinking about political issues is on the rise. There was one glaring exception: health, and by extension, food. Consistent with their earlier research (discussed in thefirst report in this series), FrameWorks found that individualistic thinking through theconsumer framedominates the public’s relationship to food. This is a problem for animal advocates: the consumer frame, connected to strong values of personal choice and freedom, creates opposition to our goals. However, while the consumer frame is dominant, other frames may already exist through which the public would be more sympathetic. In this phase of the research, we conducted interviews with ordinary American meat eaters in an attempt to discover what frames underpin latent public support for the goals of the animal movement, and what messages advocates could use to activate that support. We identified promising frames animal advocates can use to build support for a future without using animals for food. We also observed several common patterns people use to justify their opposition to the movement, patterns we believe advocates are not currently addressing. We experimented with several strategies to overcome these rationalizations and found which were most effective. Throughout the study, the decisive factor determining how sympathetic an interviewee was to animal advocates was whether we successfully shifted their perspective away from the consumer frame.","text",1
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Our core recommendation is that animal advocates must work to replace the consumer frame: in our own thinking about farming animals, in our messages to the public, and ultimately, in the public discourse. In brief, other key takeaways are:","text",2
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","After analyzing materials published by animal advocates, industry, and news media to map out the narrative landscape concerning farming animals, we turned our attention to the general public. Overall, we designed these interviews touncover the frames, narratives, metaphors, values, and beliefs underpinning latent public support for abolishing animal agriculture.It was, of course, a hypothesis that such latent public support exists to begin with. We often framed that hypothesis in terms of survey findings from the previous ten years or so. In these surveys (discussed at length in thesecond report in this series), surprisingly large numbers of people agreed with statements as radical as supporting aban on slaughterhouses (48%), a total ban on farming animals (33%), or the view that“all animals deserve the same rights as humans…” (32%). In some of these same samples, however, over 95% agreed with the statement “eating meat is a personal choice and nobody can tell me what to do.” Contradictions like these are abundant in public opinion surveys about all kinds of topics. The explanation probably has a lot to do with framing. According to the cognitive linguist George Lakoff, narrative frames (metaphors, values, beliefs, and stories that help us understand the world) often function with a quality ofmutual inhibitionsimilar to muscle pairs. When you flex your bicep, your tricep automatically disengages; it’s awkward to flex both at the same time. Similarly, our brain has the ability to look at a particular issue from different perspectives, but usually not at the same time, at least not without a struggle. Frames are the way our brains make sense of the world. There is no “neutral” frame, and there is often no such thing as “neutral” language. This poses a serious challenge for surveys. The language in surveys often activates one frame, while another question a few moments later can activate a different frame.","text",3
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","For anyone responding to questions about a topic they aren’t an expert on, it can be extremely easy to flip back and forth between different frames without noticing contradictions in the consequences of different statements.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Accordingly, we hypothesized that these surveys pointed to promising frames in the minds of one third to one half of respondents. The frame behind the personal choice question was obviously the familiarconsumer framediscussed in earlier reports in this series. The consumer frame corresponds much more to the daily behaviors of these respondents, nearly all of whom eat meat regularly. But what frames were respondents looking through when expressing support for a total ban on farming animals? If we can identify these frames and design messages which activate them while deactivating the consumer frame, we may dramatically expand support for our movement. That is precisely what our 1:1 interviews were designed to do. Thanks to existing research, we already suspected that non-experts would have different ways of understanding the issue than the advocate frames ofrightsandwelfare. We were curious to see whether their ways of talking about the issue tracked more closely to any of the narratives preferred by journalists and opposition groups. 2.1 Sampling We recruited participants from Reddit and Facebook with an announcement of a paid public opinion study on “food and agriculture.” They were first asked to fill out an intake survey collecting demographic data. U.S.-based respondents of voting age were invited to participate in a 30-minute interview and paid $20 upon completion of the interview and an exit survey that asked how the discussion affected their views. Several hundred completed the survey, of which nearly 50% were disqualified for being outside the U.S. Roughly 150 eligible candidates were invited to participate in the order they had filled out the form until a final 70 interviews were completed. We focused on the large majority of Americans who rarely think critically about eating animals, or the movement to end the farming of animals, and excluded vegans and vegetarians from the study entirely.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Even among meat-eaters, however, we did not expect a monolithic viewpoint. Rather, we expected participants would roughly fall into a friendly base, the persuadable middle, or the intractable opposition, which would correlate with political affiliation, age, and gender. We were especially interested in 33-48% of people who might express the sort of contradiction described above (i.e. agreeing that animals should have the same rights as humans while also agreeing that eating meat is a personal choice).","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","To identify those segments, we collected responses to amodel animal rights questionused in those earlier surveys. Participants also selected their political leaning from a list: conservative, liberal, moderate leaning conservative/liberal, progressive, and unaffiliated, along with their presidential vote in the 2020 election. Respondents who indicated “moderate leaning [conservative/liberal]” are quoted in this report as conservative or liberal if their presidential vote matched that answer, or as moderate if it did not. However, other than vegetarians and vegans, we did not use this demographic information to exclude participants. We were not confident enough in our model for predicting base, persuadable, and opposition inclinations. We also wanted to see if the frames leading the base to express sympathy may in fact be present among the public more broadly, but be more difficult to activate. While this was not deliberate on our part, our sample was moderately skewed toward young, female, and liberal/progressive people. In effect, the segment of the population most receptive to animal advocates was well represented. 2.2 Methods Interviews were conducted iteratively in rounds. For each round, we created a script, conducted 7-10 interviews, and manually performed thematic analysis of the transcripts using the open-source qualitative research software Taguette. (Transcripts were generated automatically with Otter.ai then manually edited for accuracy.) Then we identified the themes relating to latent support for the animal movement’s goals and made changes to the script enabling us to dig deeper into those particular themes in the next round of interviews. Before and during the interview, participants were told the study was being conducted by “The Institute for the Study of Cultural Trends,” a fictional organization, in order to minimize social desirability bias.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","(This deception was revealed after the interview.) Interviewers wore professional clothing and made our best efforts to conceal our interest in the study. By the end of the interview, 50% of participants correctly identified that the study was run by an “animal advocacy group”, with 43% guessing a “university department “and 7% guessing an “animal agriculture business”. Accordingly, social desirability bias may have played a role in some responses.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","The first script consisted of very open-ended questions including “What comes to mind when you think of animals used for food?” and “Are you aware of any problems associated with using animals for food?” As the research progressed and later scripts evolved, the questions became more specific, often borrowing language from earlier participants, for instance, “Some people oppose a transition away from using animals for food because they feel that it’s natural, that humans belong in the food chain and are meant to eat other animals. What do you think about that?” Our hope was to use this lay-person language, which differed significantly from common advocate language, to get a more honest insight into respondents’ views. Gradually, we replaced the open-ended with potential advocate messages. All the interview scripts and transcripts are available in the materials. Ultimately, we conducted 9 rounds of interviews for a total of 70, each lasting about half an hour. Each transcript was reviewed and coded independently by two reviewers, chosen on a rotating basis from a total of three reviewers. At the end of each round, the reviewers met to share their notes and develop the next script. The findings are discussed below. 3. Avoidance, Dissonance, Rationalization: Mapping Public Reactions 3.1 A Model of Public Attitudes A common debate among animal advocates is whether messaging should focus on animal suffering, environmental harm, human health, or a combination thereof, with worker abuse or other injustices increasingly considered as well. All of these options reflect an intuitive assumption that advocacy should focus on convincing the public to stop farming and eating animals because of how harmful it is. However, our interviews suggest this is a losing strategy. The simple reason is that the public is already familiar with much of this information (or at least the people in this study, who skewed a bit to the socio-political left).","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","All of our interviews opened with the question, “What comes to mind when you think of animals used for food?” The wording of this question was chosen in consultation with other researchers to be as “neutral” as possible, yet most interviewees began their answers describing a sense of guilt or shame about their meat consumption in light of the harms they were aware of. For our participants, this simple question brought out memories of seeing footage from inside factory farms and slaughterhouses, reasonably accurate information about the environmental impact of industrial animal agriculture, and philosophical questions about the basic ethics of breeding animals just to kill and eat them. For the minority who didn’t respond this way at first, the follow-up question “Are you aware of any problems associated with using animals for food?” usually sufficed.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","This does not mean that every respondent renounced meat-eating as a result of their interview. Instead, we witnessed repeating patterns in how people grapple with their discomfort. We listened to what seemed like well-rehearsed rhetorical strategies people used to escape from this cognitive dissonance. This involved a number of rationalizations (such as tradition, naturalness, and futility) which will be familiar to any experienced animal advocate, along with a surprisingly self-aware determination to avoid thinking about the topic. But the relationships we saw between these patterns could inform a different messaging strategy than advocates are using currently. In a nutshell, many (if not most) members of the public are already well aware of the harms of animal agriculture; they rely on more nuanced justifications to rationalize their meat consumption (which we believe is driven more by social norms than by rational thinking). Crucially, when advocates speak only about the industrial harms (regardless of whether the focus is animals, environment, or health), we come across as disconnected and lacking empathy for these deeper objections. To connect with the public, advocates must direct far more of our communication efforts toward these concerns, while presenting a credible pathway for people to become movement supporters without thesocial risks associated with veganism. We grouped these patterns into four categories: Now we’ll examine each of these in depth. Avoidance Avoidance is most people’s first line of defense on the subject of eating animals. What surprised us, however, was how many people were not only aware of their own use of this strategy, but willing to admit to it with minimal prodding. These representative quotes each came almost immediately in response to the open-ended questions described above: I'm a little ashamed to say that I stick my head in the sand. Like, I don't want to know how cruel the slaughter is.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","I don't want to know how scared the chicken is right before its head gets chopped off.","text",12
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","I had read something that was describing animals being led to the slaughter and how scared they were at the end. And just I can't even think about that, because I've been an animal lover all my life. It makes me sad. I try not to think too hard when I'm at a restaurant, or when I'm eating meat. It just kind of ruins it. If I think very hard about it, I will end up not wanting meat for a while. Right away, responses like these present a complication to common survey findings about public opinion of farming animals. In surveys, only a small percentage of people report being uneasy with the facts of using animals for food. We believe this reflects the superficial nature of surveys, and that for many people, short survey questions simply don’t break through their habitual avoidance. In the interview setting, however, it didn’t take much for people to both acknowledge their avoidance and (temporarily) move through it. The simple question “What comes to mind when you think of animals used for food?” was originally intended to be as neutral as possible, but it proved to be a very effective tool to invite people into their full dissonance around the topic.The key was that this question did not trigger defensiveness.Unlike advocate messages about the harms of animal agriculture, this open-ended question created enough psychological safety for the respondent to explore their own ethical misgivings around eating animals. This touches on another key theme of this report: advocates must not underestimate the tendency of meat eaters to have a defensive reaction to even the mildest messages about the harms of farming animals. Whether it is because of past experiences they’ve had with advocates (even as impersonal as seeing a video of a PETA protest) or simply because food is such a sensitive, personal topic, participants were hypersensitive to any language from the researchers which could imply a negative moral judgment of meat consumption on the individual level.","text",13
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Yet when invited to share their own thoughts, these same participants could deeply question the ethics of farming and slaughtering animals. In some cases, participants reacted defensively to language which was similar or even less condemnatory than language they themselves had used moments ago.","text",14
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","This was our key finding about avoidance:in order to break through avoidance, we recommend advocates lead with questions and empathic language,making space for the audience to reflect on their own misgivings. The quotes above show how people are willing to open up in response to the right question, as opposed to a strongly-worded advocate message which usually brings up defensiveness. Many skilled advocates already use questions this way on the interpersonal level, but we can apply the same principle to mass-scale messaging as well. For instance, consider a social media ad asking “How do you feel when you think about what happens to animals used for food?” Another strategy is to anticipate some of their more nuanced rationalizations and offer empathy and even validation of them. First, let’s take a closer look at the emotional turmoil lurking right underneath avoidance. Dissonance Beneath a hardened but thin layer of avoidance, most of our interview subjects revealed a disorganized landscape of contradictory data and emotions. A jumble of facts and images each person has heard and seen about the harms of industrial animal agriculture is stored here alongside feelings of guilt and shame (and memories of the time they tried being vegetarian for a couple of weeks), but also strong feelings of attachment to meat as familiar and delicious. While operating at this layer, our participants seemed trapped between these forces. These quotes were typical: I can't remember everything that I saw, but it was enough that it made me nauseous to think about eating meat. I've had issues with it since I was a child really. There were times I took a week or two weeks off from eating meat. Because thinking about it, that was a live animal. It just disgusts me so much. I just feel discomfort generally, trying to reconcile the nature of needing to eat with loving animals. So I get uncomfortable with that for sure.","text",15

I want to do the right thing, to… care about these animals, but at the same time, [meat] is just something that's all I know.” Talking about it out loud almost makes me feel guilty… I love animals. But at the same time, I'm a meat eater… I've always wanted to not be that way, but then I'm like, what would I eat? The subject of this dissonance differed somewhat among participants. Environmental harm was occasionally spoken of this way but usually was discussed in much more sterile terms. Instead, animal suffering was clearly the most common theme. Later in the interviews, participants commonly distinguished between the conditions animals live in and the ethical questions around slaughter itself, but when initially expressing this kind of dissonance, such distinctions were often absent. This was exactly what we were searching for, a frame of mind in which respondents were most receptive to the possibility of abolishing the farming of animals. Many participants wondered out loud whether it might be possible after all to stop using animals for food, or expressed remorse that they didn’t know what they could do to support that goal. Others mentioned their efforts to consume less meat. For a brief window of time, the subtext of their responses seemed to be:If I could see a way that this change was possible, I would support it.It seemed that an advocate message which could get people into this frame, and offer a credible path toward abolition, would find an enthusiastic audience. However, without such a message, people did not stay here for long. Rationalization After stewing for perhaps a few minutes in moral distress, participants would begin to find their footing. At this point, they would deploy a series of intellectual justifications for continuing to eat animals.","text",17

But on the other hand, it's kind of what's called the food cycle… even if we don't eat them, there are other animals that eat other animals. This is something I would want to say yes to. But then when I think of it, I know there's a lot of cultures that have a lot of cultural dishes. And then even the dishes aside, you have aspects of religion where like, even if you're using the animals that you've killed, it's like a sacrifice, you do it with the animal in mind. We've been doing it for a while. That's not to say that we've always done it this way. That's kind of the context of the argument that a lot of people will say, obviously that's not always like sound logic… eventually you're supposed to progress in society and get better. Nature's cold. There's a lot of cruelty in the human condition… humans can be capable of horrible, atrocious, atrocious cruelty. But it's part of the package. This is not to say these justifications were generated on the spot. In their responses, many participants showed that they had indeed thought about the topic more than they might have admitted at first. Different people also preferred different rationalizations. For instance, they might reject a common “naturalness” rationalization after hearing a paraphrased statement from an earlier interview, but agree with an argument based on culture and tradition. While some rationalizations were more common than others, there was only one argument that a clear majority of participants preferred. This rationalization was so consistent and effective that it performed a different function entirely: futility. Futility Up to this point in the conversation, the participants appeared to be grasping, trying on different arguments, searching for something that could remedy the uncomfortable dissonance present in their relationship to meat.","text",19

I could go on a boycott tomorrow and say, ‘I'm not paying until the meat industry improves.’ But there's a billion other people in this country that will continue to eat Big Macs. If I stopped eating meat, somebody else is gonna eat meat. Everyday there is a child born that's going to eat meat. So am I really making a difference if I don't eat meat? No, it's just a personal choice. “Until our political system is fixed, and FYI, it's not going to get fixed… We will have coal, and they will slaughter animals, as long as Trump and his guys can go play golf and be rich.” I kind of see it as a necessary evil… There's no way everybody's gonna change. The intractability of farming animals wascommon sensein our interviews, and it made other questions seem unimportant. We came to see futility as the first and most important framing obstacle to overcome; in order to activate support, we needed to create a sense that change was possible to begin with. Many of the quotes and observations shared thus far are focused on the participants’ own meat-eating and their thoughts about it. These quotes largely came in response to our open-ended questions about “using animals for food.” In these questions, participants seemed to hear an implicit ask to become vegetarian or explain why they weren’t already. The prevalence of theconsumer framein their responses shows how this is the default frame for people to think about food and animals. The consumer frame was deeply tied to futility; as consumers, the subjects we interviewed saw no credible way their actions (or anybody’s actions) could make a difference. Subverting the consumer frame proved crucial to our efforts to subvert futility. Let’s examine how. 3.2 Overcoming Futility byEvolving Together Futility presented a uniquely challenging framing obstacle.","text",21
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","While participants employed a range of other justifications, many participants also disagreed with these using lay-person language. Borrowing this language and presenting it back to later interviewees was our preferred way to address these justifications.

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Attempts by animal advocates to reframe the issue as one of collective systemic change (in contrast to individual consumer change, which is met with this sense of futility) are not novel. For example, since its founding in 2013, Direct Action Everywhere was one animal advocacy group attempting to relay a message that animal oppression is a “systemic issue” requiring a political solution. From our early interviews, however, we began to get a sense of why these reframing efforts may have fallen short. Americans are deeply habituated to thinking about food as a consumer issue. Their understanding of the food system beyond their trips to the grocery store is severely limited. As a result, messages about “systemic change” appear to have taken for granted a level of understanding that simply wasn’t there. For example, the public may imagine the government playing a minor role in ensuring food is safe, but rarely imagine government policy has any effect on their food choices through subsidies and regulations, and may question whether it ever could. Advocates seem to understand the need for reframing, yet in practice continue to underestimate the challenge it poses. Some activist messaging has explicitly contrasted “individual” and “consumer change” with “systemic” or “social change.” Yet our interview subjects almost never used these phrases or phrases like them, suggesting they do not map well to the public’s model of animals and food, and even societal change processes in general. When there is a mismatch between the way experts, advocates, and the public understand the issue, often the first step is for advocates to become aware of when they may be using jargon (the meaning of which is as obvious to them as it is confounding to the public) and replace that jargon with clear, accessible explanations of the concepts it stands in for. This is easier said than done and requires both discipline and experimentation.","text",23
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","It took us several iterations of our script (corresponding to several rounds of feedback from real people) to hone in on language which was at least modestly successful in overcoming the gap in understanding between interviewer and participant.","text",24
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","What was that gap in understanding? Essentially, a vision of how a societal evolution away from relying on animals for food could unfold. Advocates, who enjoy staying informed about the latest developments in alternative foods, and understand the power of government to shape the market dynamics of animal meat, have an easy time seeing how society could undergo a rapid transition if the right forces aligned. For members of the public who lack this understanding, the task of imagining such a transition is staggering. This isn’t to say they are aware of no evidence that this change could happen. Rather, they don’t have a conceptual model to organize that evidence, or at least one that is called to mind by messages about “systemic change.” In early interviews, for instance, we saw that thinking about the trajectory of new meat alternatives could temporarily lead to openness about the possibility of change. The task was to form this into a coherent vision, in lay-accessible language, for how all this could lead to a future without animal meat, involving a clear role for public policy as well as for the listener themselves. The Evolve Together Frame The most potent metaphor we identified for communicating that vision is anevolutionaway from meat at the societal level. We first noticed some participants using this metaphor, both explicitly and implicitly. Then we created a message based on it. After several iterations and rounds of feedback from dozens of interviews, the following paragraph took shape: In recent years, as meat alternatives have become widely available, concerns have grown about various problems arising from using animals for food. Some people think that society is evolving away from using animals for food altogether. Imagining a scenario where consumers, food producers, restaurants and grocery stores work together with policymakers to phase out meat, would you be in favor of a complete transition away from killing animals for food?","text",25
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","The paragraph above is not a silver bullet. It was able to clearly communicate to participants that advocates are concerned with a gradual society-wide transition, rather than demanding they go vegan right then and there (which participants otherwise assumed). At its best, this language was able to overcome the dominant belief that a future without slaughtering animals is impossible. This still didn’t resolve many other rationalizations which participants would then fall back upon. It also rarely generated support for government action; while most participants said they would be in favor of the transition, they often emphasized that it should come from consumers, not the government. Further, this excerpt functioned within a 30-minute conversation about animals used for food, during which participants had usually already expressed some degree of remorse on the topic. This context was a rare luxury, differing substantially from the determined avoidance which characterizes so many people’s attitudes on a day-to-day basis.","text",26
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","That said, to the extent futility often presented a barrier to productive conversations about participants’ other rationalizations, theevolutionframe represented a major turning point in our interviews. As the message above gradually took shape over several rounds of interviews, futility came to play a smaller and smaller role. Here’s why each part of it was included: In recent years… Futility partly stems from people’s lived reality: almost everyone they know eats animals, while every restaurant and institution they frequent serves animals. It would be strange to look at this and think meat was on the way out. However, while meat reduction may be socially marginal, if it is showing signs of becominglessmarginal, it just might be en route to take over. Borrowing from the work of sociologist Gregg Sparkman and his colleagues, we attempted to frame meat dissonance as adynamic norm,that is, a norm in the process of shifting, emphasizing the growth of meat alternatives and concerns rather than their minority status. …as meat alternatives have become widely available… Many participants independently brought up the increasing visibility of meat alternatives, especially Beyond and Impossible. This was the closest most participants came on their own to questioning futility. Other participants earnestly asked what they would be expected to eat in a meat-free future; to them, reminders about Beyond and Impossible meats were reassuring. Leading with this reminder anticipated these objections so we could keep the focus on more substantive issues. …concerns have grown about various problems arising from using animals for food. In the course of our conversations, we learned that we could not skip directly to addressing futility and other rationalizations. Drawing out dissonance first was necessary so people could remind themselves why they might support a transition away from animal meat.","text",27

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Some people think that society is evolving away from using animals for food altogether. The shift away from the consumer frame is anchored in the explanatory metaphor ofevolution.This metaphor was much more effective than analogies to other social justice movements for helping participants start to envision the change process. Instead of an implicit demand to go vegan,evolutionhelped participants envision a gradual transition across society. This addressed one of our participants' top concerns: that change would be forced on people too quickly for them to adapt. Imagining a scenario where consumers, food producers, restaurants and grocery stores work together with policymakers to phase out meat… This drives home the previous sentence, reiterating it and adding detail. Because the consumer frame is so dominant, a counterframe will require a great deal of repetition in order to sink in, as well as elaboration to close the knowledge gap between advocate and audience. We already discussed the need to replace jargon with clear, accessible explanations. Naming the different actors involved in the food system was one way to do that. Remember that the inclusion of “policymakers” did invite resistance from many participants. Later, we will discuss further efforts to build in a role for government action. …would you be in favor of a complete transition away from killing animals for food? Because their attitude towards the topic is characterized by avoidance and dissonance, urging participants to take a clear position in favor or against killing animals for food is crucial. Generally, people would love to be able to avoid taking a hard stance either way while continuing with their current behavior. However, when pressed, many of those same people will come down in favor of evolving away from meat. Of course, it is a strategic question for organizations how they can create this dilemma for people in the real world (e.g.","text",29

In order for a new frame to catch on, it needs to be sticky. That is, people can not only remember it but adopt it after hearing it. This is why we hoped to draw out frames from our participants rather than create one from scratch. Theevolutionframe demonstrated this quality, with many participants repeatedly referring back to it once they heard it, in stark contrast to theconsumer-centric futility that dominated earlier interviews: ...everything is evolving now, so why not adapt current times to our needs now?... We can totally create new traditions. ...we have evolved so much that we shouldn't really need to [eat meat], and it does kind of seem a bit primitive, now that you're mentioning it that way. Everything is changing and evolving all the time, just look at, you know, today's world compared to even a year ago. So it's inevitable that change is going to happen… most people, if they can see the lasting harm from continuing to eat meat and the slaughter of animals and everything, I think that they would at least attempt to make the change. ...we are evolving into a more progressive society as a species very, very slowly. The future can be plant based… ...evolution went that way [towards eating meat]. But we're still evolving, so much that we can evolve away from it. I'm thinking about society as a whole. And like how we consume food, or use resources… I think it's really useful to kind of move onward, or think critically about what we really want to do. And how we can maybe seek out other alternatives… sustainable practices with food and other related areas. Why was this frame so effective?","text",31

I think it's definitely what we're shifting towards anyways. I think all this going green and trying to be efficient… being conscious of the environment around us, and the other animals and stuff. While modernity and technological progress are useful frames for animal advocates,evolutiongoes further. First, it contains a stronger element of motion, inviting participants to envision a future different from the present, which most peoplerarely do. For our participants, evolution also emphasized that the change would be gradual, as opposed to people being “forced to change overnight.” Evolutionis also more versatile thanmodernity. Whilemodernityconjures scientific progress, and to a lesser extent moral progress, evolution as a metaphor can be applied broadly. Accordingly, our participants adopted the evolution frame to dismiss both culture and naturalness rationalizations (two of the most persistent rationalizations discussed in more length below): Talking about culture, I feel it kind of evolves as we move forward in the future. Coming from maybe 100 years ago, things have changed drastically. We've evolved quite a bit from the thousands and millions of years that we've lived here. With that evolution needs to come change… if we eat less meat and then at the same time start introducing the alternatives, that’s what we need to see.

Also see the “Stuff That Didn’t Work” section below for some more strategies we found to be ineffective in overcoming futility, such as analogizing animal rights to other social justice movements. 3.3 Disarming Common Rationalizations At first, many of our conversations followed a common pattern, starting with avoidance, moving through dissonance and guilt, then turning to rationalization, with futility being a particularly effective and universal rationalization. When we were able to subvert the futility argument, several other common arguments remained. We sought ways to undermine the narrative power of these arguments, in order to mobilize participants’ discomfort and guilt to build support for an animal-free transition. Broadly speaking, different responses to opposition arguments could be grouped into three categories:ignore, refute,andempathize.Ignoring is similar to the strategy described by cognitive scientist George Lakoff in his bookDon’t Think of an Elephant.Lakoff suggests that responding to an argument directly often plays into the underlying frame of that argument. Instead, we can respond by reiterating our own frame and values. The animal advocate messages we reviewed earlier in this study focused on a combination of the first two strategies, either ignoring or attempting to directly refute opposition arguments. In our interviews, these strategies were effective against some of the rationalizations we commonly encountered. For other arguments, however, an approach based on empathy and even validation appeared to be much more productive. One example is theculture & traditionframe.","text",35
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","When the interviewer reflected the underlying values behind this common objection, participants would often relax and show more willingness to consider how those values could be preserved without farming animals.","text",36
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","These objections(which we will examine in depth below)are the source of much disconnection between animal advocates and the public.While animal advocates continue to focus their messaging on the harms of animal agriculture, much of the public’s resistance actually lies in deeper values such as culture, tradition, and naturalness, which remain largely unaddressed by animal advocates. These are reinforced by more familiar concerns like cost, taste, convenience, and personal choice. Together, these are the core opposing frames that animal advocates must anticipate and overcome in their communications to the public. Watching interviewees wrestle with these rationalizations out loud, we observed patterns that could help advocates more effectively address them. The following sections examine each of these in turn. Culture The essence of objections focused on culture is that in calling for a transition away from meat, animal advocates are showing insufficient respect for the important role meat plays in people’s cultural identities. Participants mentioned traditions large and small, e.g. family traditions as well as the practices of major religions. They also invoked human evolution and thousands of years of ancestry to further legitimize cultural practices of meat eating. (We’ll examine those more closely in a moment.) These cultural appeals came in different flavors. Some interviewees (including most conservatives as well as Muslims and other religious people) focused on the role meat played in their own culture, traditions, and upbringing, while others (especially more progressive participants) focused on the important role meat plays in other people’s cultures around the world, and immigrant cultures in the U.S.","text",37

The underlying values here may be quite different, with the more liberal tendency emphasizingmulticulturalismand cultural relativity, while conservatives focused onupholding tradition.The difference is evident in these representative quotes:","text",38
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","I don't have a problem with that at all. I'm from the south, just about every person in my family, friends, they're hunters, they're fishermen. That's just part of our lifestyle here, our culture. There are a lot of places in the world where that's a necessity. And the way they treat an animal may not be to our standard or something else, but it is a necessity for their society, and they're using their local ecosystem to survive, which they've been doing for centuries, millennia, probably… In America, we're a melting pot, so many people are coming from cultures where you're expecting them to essentially give up their own identity… it has a lot to do with our privilege in this country. I remember my mom telling me that she grew up with her dad, basically he owned a little small farm. And so she's just used to being raised eating natural meats. And because of the way she grew up, that also influences us as a family as a whole. I feel like with alternatives… the recipes or traditions probably don't feel as good. It would be very privileged of us, because it's easy to say that when we're white people with a very Christian background who do not have a biblical reverence the way indigenous practitioners and people would, it's very easy for us to say that it's not necessary or that it's cruel, but we haven't really experienced a life where we see or are interconnected in such a loving and respectful way where we dedicate ourselves to making sure there is zero waste with any animal we consume. Some versions of this rationale focused down on a micro level to the individual’s upbringing. As if thinking out loud, many participants chalked their meat consumption habits up to the fact that they wereraised that way: I prefer to eat meat, just because I guess I was raised like that. And I would still prefer to eat that to mainly get my protein source… I know, I can also get protein through a vegetarian diet or vegan diet, but it would be much harder to do.","text",39

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Upbringing was linked to culture by an element of defensiveness that was often associated with both sets of responses. These arguments appeared to be a way for participants to reassure themselves thatI am not a bad person for eating meat.This defensiveness was undoubtedly something participants brought into the interview with them. Culture arguments reassured them that meat eating is normal among people they respect, including their family: It's something that you're, you're raised to eat meat, nobody told me how bad it was. And now, people might think it’s too late, because you’ve already lived a quarter of your life. That's the way I guess you were raised. When we were younger, nobody talked about stuff like that, you know? I wouldn't necessarily be against it. But at the same time, I do have cultural beliefs where there are some dishes that have cultural foods in them that I like, lamb and whatnot, that I eat once a year. I don't think I'm an awful person for eating lamb once a year. When ​​I visited Asia, I went to Bangkok. They have this floating market. The fishermen are out, they live on their boats, and they fish. So that's their livelihood. Does that make them a bad person? No… That's their way of life. Interviewees had a habit of hearing personal attacks and moral judgments even in the mildest advocate language. Advocates would be well advised to anticipate this defensiveness from the general public and explore ways to get out ahead of it in their messaging. One way is to emphasize that we do not blame individuals. This can be done overtly in the message, or more discreetly by using meat-eating messengers whenever possible (the next report discusses messengers at length). Another subtle strategy is to connect with the public over precisely the values behind these objections. When appropriate, animal advocates should emphasize the ways we value respect for cultural identities and traditions.","text",41

Some participants were able to gracefully summarize this rich duality. In fact, moments like this is exactly where theevolutionmetaphor first presented itself: We've been hunting for hundreds of thousands of years. If my ancestors didn't hunt, I probably wouldn't be here today. That's what we had to do for survival. But I think some people would also say that it's kind of unethical when we're at a point in the world where we don't have to do that. It's not like 1850, and I'm a pioneer in California, killing a bear for meat or something, it just doesn't work like that anymore. Talking about culture, I feel it kind of evolves as we move forward… coming in from 100 years ago, things have changed drastically. So I think now looking at the kind of concerns we have, we would have to adapt and meet midway and be able to reduce pollution or the exploitation which is taking place. I would say that culture would probably adapt to what's going on right now. These are people who haven't been shown any other way… And some people are very scared of science, as we've seen now in the recent pandemic. So it seems natural that people would be scared of just not eating meat… But I do think they're being closed-minded about the fact that there could be other alternatives that can taste just as good.

But on the other hand, it's kind of what's called the food cycle… There are other animals that eat other animals, too, right? Hunting animals and eating animals has been a part of our anthropology. While I do feel for the animals that are killed, I feel like hunting and eating meat are connected to us in a very primal way… it adheres to the natural order of things, to consume meat products. We're technically omnivores. Meat is part of our diet and biologically, [part of] us too. For that argument’s sake, it's also a cultural thing. A lot of cultures will eat meat, but they will respect the animal by using the whole animal. They are the food chain, if you will. They're meant to be eaten. Participants also expressed concerns about thenaturalnessof meat alternatives. Many people mentioned that plant-based meat alternatives are made with “fillers,” which appeared to be a stand-in for any mysterious or untrustworthy ingredients. Concerns about cultivated meat were more on the moral level, questioning whether it should be done at all (though many other participants were enthusiastic about the technology). Disgust was evident in both types of response: I didn't know until recently that a lot of these [plant-based meats] are still made with fillers… They're just without meat but filled with fillers. I think it's not normal… I just can't believe that something like that would be good for you. I'm sure they have all their protocols and everything that they test, but it just seems too abnormal to do something like that.","text",45

Instead, we tried anticipating objections based on naturalness. Often, simply hearing thenaturalframe stated clearly was enough to make people question it. We call this strategy “pulling back the curtain.”Some research has shownthat when the frame behind a message is pointed out clearly, it often becomes less persuasive. After presenting different versions of the “evolve together” message discussed above, we asked participants this question:","text",46
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Some people want society to continue using animals for food because they feel that it’s natural, that humans belong in the food chain and are meant to eat other animals. What comes up when you think about that? Before we started asking this question, participants often used precisely this kind of reasoning to argue in favor of eating animals. But in later interviews where we presented this overt language, most people ridiculed it, especially once they’d been armed with theevolutionframe: I think that was something prevalent in the stone age, where the only availability was to kill an animal and eat. Right now we have so, so much. So many alternatives. We have the ability to grow any crop… to go to those primitive times and think about the food chain, I think it's kind of insulting to the evolution that has occurred. That's not true… We’re the top of the food chain, we could kill and then get rid of an entire species and take it for its tusks, or its fur or its meat, or its ambergris, or whatever it might be. Just because we can doesn't mean it's right… in the past, you had… to eat animals, but it's different now. ​​I have friends who are staunchly anti-vegan… that's kind of the argument they say. I don't really believe in that… It's not like we had medicine for so long, like medicine in itself is innately unnatural, but it's something that we are very glad to have nowadays. In 31 interviews where this question was asked, 21 respondents dismissed thenaturalnessobjection while only 8 still agreed with it (2 responses were neither positive nor negative). When it came tonaturalness,simply presenting the common pro-meat argument back was more effective than any of the counter-arguments we formulated. For instance, we tested one message based on the analogy to modern medicine from the participant above. In effect, this just gave participants something else to argue with and poke holes in.","text",47

In practice, advocates can experiment with communications that “pull back the curtain” on common opposition arguments and the frames underpinning them. Our interviews did not suggest that there is an opportunity for animal advocates to co-opt thenaturalnessframe; like theconsumerframe, it is loaded against us. But the naturalness frame (like thelegacyframe discussed later) is a great opportunity for animal advocates to play thetricksterarchetype, mocking this vulnerable opposition argument without exposing our message to a counter-argument. We can also employ what George Lakoff calls a “truth sandwich.” Start by delivering our message framed on our terms, then point out the illogic of the opposition frame, before reiterating our own message.","text",48
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Price, Taste, Convenience, and Health Cultureandnaturerepresented one cluster of rationalizations based on deep values. Price, taste, convenience and health were a different cluster based on practical concerns. Of course it is not surprising that respondents turned to practicality to explain their preference for animal meat. What is notable is how often these concerns seemed divorced from personal experience. Rather, it wascommon senseamong our participants that animal-free diets are an expensive sacrifice for privileged people. The vitamins and minerals, along with the level of protein that's provided by eating meat, chicken, or meat, poultry, and fish… I don't know that that can be accomplished by being meatless because I don't know that there's enough options. You're so used to it, because it's just habit, eating all this food. You know what it tastes like. You know it tastes good… but then I feel so bad after seeing all these videos, and like seeing what it's like, when I can't experience it in real life. I think affordability is also a major issue. Like if I want to get cheese, in my area, [for an amount] the size of my palm, I'll have to pay a good $18 to $25 to get that amount of cheese. And for some people that's a daily staple, and they can't afford that. I've thought about entirely cutting meat out a lot. For me, it kind of comes down to convenience. I know that my boyfriend wouldn't be open to it. We cook meals together. And so it would kind of make it more complicated in the sense of me having to cook separately and things like that. It kind of makes more work, which I know is a lazy, really poor excuse. Thanks toMelanie Joy’s work, many animal advocates understand the importance that the perception of thenormalcyof meat eating plays in individuals’ decisions to consume. In our interviews, we observed two different patterns connected to normalcy. One is theculturerationalization already discussed.","text",49
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","In the second,normalcywas mentioned as a much more practical concern:","text",50
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","[My views on using animals for food are] somewhat negative, especially with the way animals are treated, like there's some guilt involved with me eating animals. But not extremely negative, just because so many people do it around me. I know logically, if everyone individually stopped eating meat, there would not be the meat industry. Simultaneously, it is just impossible to escape that feeling of like, all my friends eat meat, right? Especially when you have 20 people that you hang out with, and they only eat meat. We were struck by how honest participants were about these practical concerns, as well as their self-awareness when describing the role that the behavior of those around them played in their own decision to eat meat. This finding reinforces the notion that animal advocates should target community-level interventions rather than individual-level diet change advocacy, because many people are not willing to be the only one in their social group to change their habits around meat. Animal advocates focused on developing and promoting alternative proteins are well aware of practical concerns among the public, especially cost, taste, and accessibility. That said, those advocates should be aware of common health concerns. The notion that plant-based meats are dangerously high in sodium in particular had firmly taken root among our sample and was mentioned numerous times. Our interviews suggested that the public's views of these products lag somewhat behind reality. For instance, many participants’ negative opinions about taste were based on one experience they had years ago, and impressions of cost and accessibility were also sometimes outdated or exaggerated. (A large number of participants also reported positive taste experiences.) This suggests that for some consumers, a less-than-satisfying experience can lead to years of disinterest in meat alternatives.","text",51
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","This all means that while advocates work to make meat alternatives match or exceed animal meat inreality,there is also a great deal of work needed to help the zeitgeist catch up with the developments in these unfamiliar products.","text",52
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","This is not to say that the increased visibility of meat alternatives has had no effect. To the contrary, the presence of plant-based burgers at fast food chains was perhaps the most effective message we tested for suppressing practical objections, especially concerning taste and convenience. (From our earliest interviews, many participants expressed overall positive views towards meat and dairy alternatives.) Almost all interviewees had heard about fast food chains offering plant-based options. Along with other frames, discussing this trend helped people imagine a total transition away from animal meat. We’ll discuss further testing with this message in the final report in this series. These findings endorse animal advocates’ efforts to publicize the spread of plant-based meats, especially by chains associated with affordability and convenience. At the same time, advocates and producers should be wary of the damage that can be done to consumer trust in the entire sector by bringing an unsatisfying product to market. Also, cost still remained as a strongly held concern which we were unable to find a way around through messaging alone. In the next report, we will discuss the potential for advocates to build trust with the public by naming cost as a problem, and focusing our political demands on policies that would close the price gap between animal-based and animal-free foods. Freedom of Choice Practical concerns like price, taste, and convenience represent the surface layer of the consumer frame. Clearly, these questions come to mind when someone is thinking about what products to buy. However, the consumer frame also relates to core values, just like thecultureandnaturalframes. The values underpinning the consumer frame are personal choice, independence, and freedom. Through this frame, the role of forces beyond the individual (e.g. cultural norms, our peers’ behavior) in shaping our behavior is obscured.","text",53

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","I had to stop cooking ground beef, because I couldn't tolerate the smell of it… But outside of that, when I see people eat it, it’s not like I'm just like ""ew"", I don't do that. I don't want anybody to do that with me about my food choices… I wouldn't dare walk up to a stranger and be like ‘don't eat that steak,’ you know? I feel like everyone should have a choice… people like what they like… a lot of people are eating different things for survival. I wouldn't really blame the consumers, because maybe that’s all that they have. ​​I love dogs, I love cats… I could never eat an animal that I love… But I mean, if someone else wants to, I'm not here to dictate their life. It's a cultural value. The consumer frame is a source of opposition to the goals of animal advocates. Advocates may sometimes be tempted to try to co-opt the value ofconsumer choice,for instance when arguing for the inclusion of more plant-based menu items. While this may be appropriate at times, advocates should be aware that this strategy may have long-term consequences: reinforcing the consumer frame as the primary frame used to understand food and food policy may create greater obstacles in the future. The ultimate goal of animal advocates is to restrict people’s ability to make choices that harm sentient animals and ecological systems. Such restrictions are commonplace in modern society and are the very foundation of law-based societies. By ignoring this, the consumer frame creates a highly simplistic mythology about the world. (All frames do this to some extent; frames are defined as much in terms of what information they exclude as what they focus on.) Countering the consumer frame is about disrupting that mythology, for instance by bringing in compelling information that contradicts it. In our interviews, the strongest example of this was government subsidies to meat producers.","text",55
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","The existence of large government subsidies breaks through the simplistic worldview of the consumer frame by highlighting the major role of a third-party actor.

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Perhaps the central theme of this report is that animal advocates should work hard to replace the consumer frame: in our own thinking about farming animals, in our messages to the public, and ultimately, in the public discourse. In the subsequent report discussing the next stage of our research, we’ll look at dozens of candidates for new narratives animal advocates might focus on. The rest of this report looks at various other findings from the interviews which informed those candidates. Primary Meat-Eating Rationalizations 4. Activating Latent Support Thus far, we have presented a model in which, when asked to consider animals used for food, meat eaters progress from avoidance, to dissonance, to rationalization, settling on futility. Dissonance is the sweet spot: if advocates can break through avoidance, then disarm common rationalizations, they can leverage the public's deep dissonance and guilt about meat to build support for change. None of this is easy. The rationalizations we have discussed so far represent (at least in part) thedominant narrativesabout animals used for food. For every message somebody receives from an animal advocate, they may receive dozens or hundreds reinforcing these dominant narratives. Nonetheless, our interviews pointed to some promising strategies for disarming these rationalizations. In the following report, we explore whether those strategies might be effective at the level of public communications, as opposed to one-on-one dialogues. Breaking through avoidance is its own challenge, for similar reasons: social norms and institutions are currently arranged to spare consumers any ethical discomfort concerning the topic of animals used for food.","text",57
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","On the personal level, we were able to penetrate this defensive layer with open-ended, minimally judgemental questions like “What comes to mind when you think of animals used for food?” (At the macro level, overcoming society’s practiced avoidance of these ethical problems is a strategic question outside the scope of this report.)","text",58
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","In the face of these challenges, the present research was searching for a diamond in the rough: between these habits of avoidance and rationalization, are there already frames embedded in the minds of ordinary people which, if activated, could provide a basis for a mass shift in public opinion against farming animals? Surveys suggested there might be. Our interviews found further evidence of such frames. The metaphor ofevolutionwas one that we kept returning to, but there were others. We also experimented with some common advocate arguments which backfired in surprising ways. Based on all of this, here are our recommendations. 4.1 Stuff That Works The Rise of Veganism In his bookChange,social networks researcher Damon Centola describes a problem change initiatives encounter when awareness of the initiative is widespread, but adoption rates are low: “By itself, awareness is clearly a good thing for any product campaign. And, by itself, lack of use is not necessarily a problem, particularly if your product is just getting started. But if you combine massive awareness with widespread lack of use, it can… be lethal. Why? Because if everyone in the world knows about your memorable, remarkable, discussion-worthy product, they will also be sure to notice if no one around them is using it. The more that people’s awareness of a product outpaces its actual uptake, the stronger the implicit signal from all of those non-adopters that there’s something wrong with it.” It would be difficult to generate an example of a change initiative more vulnerable to this dynamic than veganism. The vegan movement has garnered significant attention, yet uptake has stalled. In previous reports, we discussed the narrative of the “rise of veganism.” This narrative, expressed by advocates, journalists, and many members of the public including in our interviews, holds that recent years have seen a significant increase in the popularity of veganism.","text",59
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","However, studies do not find that the number of strict vegans has increased. Instead, this narrative can be explained by increased media coverage, the mainstream spread of plant-based meat alternatives, and increases in meat-reductionintentionsamong the general public.","text",60
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","This narrative certainly presents an opportunity for the animal movement to avoid the trap of increased awareness without increased adoption. Our interviewees mostly spoke positively about what they perceived as the increasing popularity of veganism and vegan foods (even if their feelings about actual vegans were less positive), even those who were least receptive to our message such as this moderate 61 year-old woman: “I think we're going away from [using animals for food]. A huge factor has been the last couple of years, of more and more plant proteins being available. I guess it was two years ago, I saw my first commercial for a meatless burger at Burger King. We're there. I mean, when fast food’s getting in on it, you know, and apparently they still have the product. So I would say we're certainly headed in that direction.” In the long term, the “rise of veganism” narrative is not without risk. Specifically, it could recreate precisely the dynamic described by Centola above. If, decades from now, people remember having the impression in the 20s that veganism was on the rise, yet it failed to reach a tipping point, it could become even more difficult to overcome futility and stagnation. Advocates should take comfort that cultural memory rarely endures that long. Overall, we recommend continuing to trumpet the rise of alternative proteins, while specifically associating it with increasing concern for farmed animals. Farmers’ Legacy:The Opposition’s Weakest Frame One of the most popular narratives journalists use to write about farming animals is the highly romantic image of a family farmer with calloused hands waking up before dawn to eke out a living from the same land their great-great-grandparents toiled on. (See thethird report in this seriesfor a full discussion.) Because this narrative was common in the news articles we reviewed, we were surprised that it did not come up more frequently with our early participants.","text",61
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Participants expressed concern for the economic struggle of the average farmer, but without the connection tolegacyandpreserving traditionpresent in news coverage.","text",62
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","In fact, once we started asking more directly about thefarmers’ legacynarrative, we found participants were scornful of it for resistingmodernity.We asked: Another concern we’ve heard is that farmers might lose their jobs. So some people oppose a transition away from meat, saying we should protect the legacy of farmers, some of whom come from families that have spent generations working hard to make a living raising animals. Do you feel that this should be cause for concern? Here’s a sample of what we heard: I don't, simply because I feel like… there's always an alternative. The jobs and the resources needed to make that work are still there. If we alter from like a cow based meat product to like a soy based one, they’ll need a lot more soy farmers and so I think you just see a shift. From what I've seen in documentaries, a lot of farmers at this point are in severe debt, and they're having to take out massive loans, not really living quite great lives themselves… At this point, farming really seems to be more like, the government is giving people loans so they can farm rather than farming [being profitable] on an individual level. If that's the way society is moving, that's the way it's moving. Should we have protected the beeper phone people when they were about to lose their job? Technology moves that way. People need to adapt. It's the way the world works. If a company didn't evolve from horseback when cars were made… then they would be left behind. I think we do need to evolve. So if they want to continue farming, they need to farm soybeans or farm something else that would be moving into the future.","text",63
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","To our surprise, pulling back the curtain on thefarmer legacynarrative was one of the most effective ways to bring up themodernityframe, a very positive frame for animal advocates and a close cousin ofevolution.Essentially, our participants wanted to look after the economic wellbeing of people who are currently farming, but they do not agree that farming animals as a career is sacred or should be protected from a changing world.","text",64
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","We recommend advocates step into the trickster role by mocking this common media and opposition narrative. Keep in mind that you don’t need to be hyperbolic; often, the most effective thing to do is simply pull back the curtain on the narrative as it truly is presented by the opposition. Presenting a caricature may undermine your credibility with your audience and is unnecessary. Instead, animal advocates can position ourselves as the realists, creating economic security for farmers by offering them a path to a more sustainable career, instead of keeping them trapped in a dying industry. Mutual Reinforcement Between Animal- and Environment-Centered Messages In a previous report, we examined evidence on the relative efficacy of health, environmental, and animal-centered messages. In short, while a majority of the public say health would be the most persuasive reason to consider changing their diets, those people find none of the arguments very persuasive. Those who find animal or environmental messages more persuasive find all the arguments to be more persuasive compared to the health group. We described these as qualities of a “base” group who is amenable to viewing the issue of animals used for food through an altruistic lens, vs. a “persuadable middle” group whose behavior on this issue can likely only be influenced by social norms. We further hypothesized that, while some people are more responsive to animal arguments compared to environmental arguments and vice versa, these two groups are better understood by their similarities than their differences. This is because thevaluesunderpinning concern for animal suffering and environmental harm are complimentary. At the beginning of this report, we discussed how some frames demonstrate a pattern of mutual inhibition, where activating one frame suppresses the other. For most of our interview participants, animal- and environment-centered messages instead had a complimentary effect.","text",65
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Without a doubt, between messages about animal suffering and the environment, many participants expressed a clear preference for one or the other. But by and large, people who followed the “base” pattern and showed greater willingness to entertain altruistic reasons for society to evolve away from meat did not find either argument offensive; they simply preferred one. Furthermore, for those people who placed more value on environmental protection, hearing a message about animal suffering simply brought to mind their environmental concerns about meat production. Particularly when envisioning a future with less or no meat, participants seemed to think it was perfectly natural to talk about these two issues in the same breath. Some respondents went a step further, explicitly linking respect for animals and respect for the environment as the same value.","text",66
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Animal cruelty would be reduced. And then there’s also no need for all the space being taken up by factories, or the pollution… It comes down to… our relationships [with animals], our environment, and our ecosystem, I think that's so important. I think it's definitely what we're shifting towards anyways… being conscious of the environment around us, and the other animals and stuff. Altogether, we suggest advocates do not necessarily need to choose between focusing their messaging on animal suffering or the environment. For much of our audience, seeing these two appeals joined together is perfectly natural, because they both ask people to consider impacts of their food they are normally far removed from. Health-based messaging, however, presents a more complicated picture. 4.2 Stuff That Doesn’t Work Our main strategy in this research was to try to draw favorable frames out of our participants, then present them back to future participants to test whether they might have promise as a messaging strategy. We experimented with several frames in this way, many of which proved ineffective for a majority of our participants. The most striking failures are described in this section, especiallysocial justice analogiesand thedog/pig comparison. Verbal Triggers of theConsumer Frame The consumer frame is pervasive in the public’s thinking about food. In an earlier report, we contrasted this withhealth care, which people are used to thinking about as a political issue, an industry with many public and private actors whose decisions shape the options available to consumers. In comparison, most members of the general public have a hard time thinking about the “food system” beyond their trips to the grocery store. This is one reason the consumer frame poses a challenge for animal advocates: it covers up legal and political pathways to phasing out the meat industry. The consumer frame is the default way that people engage with food-related goals of animal advocates.","text",67
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Virtually every moment an advocate is communicating with a member of the public presents opportunities to inadvertently trigger this counterproductive frame, potentially undoing all the advocate’s careful work up to that point to reframe the issue. It doesn’t help that advocates, like everyone else, are habituated to view food issues through the consumer frame (an easy habit to fall back on in a moment of uncertainty) and that much of the animal movement’s messaging historically has been couched in it, as well. It should be clear by now that messages about “going vegan,” “plant-based diets,” and “reducing your meat consumption” engage the consumer frame.","text",68
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Health is a particularly treacherous topic. While it is possible to consider diet through a public health and government policy lens, the FrameWorks Institute hasrecently reaffirmedthat health is perhaps the single topic which Americans are most resistant to viewing through a systems lens. Instead, the topic brings up individualistic thinking, with both healthy/fit and less healthy/fit people attributing health primarily to good or bad personal choices. Advocates who wish to address the health consequences of animal meat while avoiding the consumer frame must go to great lengths to maintain their focus on systemic factors. They should never assume either an understanding of those factors, or that the public health lense will be familiar to their audience. These may seem obvious, yet we reviewed numerous advocate materials which mentioned “public health” in passing. Based on these interviews, we doubt shorthand mentions of health have much effect other than potentially triggering the consumer frame. The public is broadly aware that animals suffer tremendously for meat; in our interviews, short allusions to this suffering brought up clear images in participants’ minds. By contrast, many participants were unconvinced that eliminating meat from their diet would be healthy, and allusions to public health typically created confusion. Contextual Triggers of theConsumer Frame For advocates who wish to avoid the trap of the consumer frame, doing so requires discipline and practice. Yet even the most disciplined reframing can be undermined by context. A good example of both of these challenges comes from the early years of Direct Action Everywhere (most of the authors of this report were involved at that time). DxE had a very clear intention to substitute the dominant consumer change message with a message about “systems change” for animals. This message was often delivered in dramatic protests inside restaurants and grocery stores.","text",69
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","During our interviews, two issues with this messaging strategy became clear. First is that the term “systems change” simply does not mean much to the general public. It turns out this was an example of jargon. DxE activists described the world they envisioned without violence against animals, but our attempts to describe the mechanism by which that change could come about fell short of connecting with the audience. Lacking a clear mechanism from us, most people defaulted to the consumer frame, assuming we were asking them to change their diet despite our insistence to the contrary.","text",70
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Thus one major pitfall is a disconnect in language between advocates and their audience. This can be overcome by carefully testing messages with laypeople who may be representative of your audience, and taking a disciplined approach to noticing and replacing jargon in your speech. The second pitfall has nothing to do with the words advocates used, instead relating towhereadvocates said them. By locating our protests inside restaurants and grocery stores, the precise location where people are most engaged in consumer decisions about food, DxE undercut our message of systemic rather than individual change. Regardless of our words (which most people made their best effort to ignore anyways), ouractionsclearly suggested we were protesting their decision to buy meat. In this sense, messaging is inextricably linked to the context the message is delivered in. This puts the onus on advocates to design strategies which reinforce their message and vice versa. While this may seem obvious, we recommend advocates specifically reconsider their messaging strategies in light of theconsumer frame. Keep in mind that because the consumer frame is so dominant, it isn’t enough to avoid it. Instead, public-facing strategies must actively work to assert a contrasting frame likeevolving together. Messages that analogize the animal freedom movement to other social justice movements (past or present) have been a source of controversy, to say the least. During the course of these interviews, we experimented with such analogies. We were partly interested in whether analogies would help participants see the use of animals as a moral or political issue.","text",71
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Primarily, however, we hoped to use analogies with social justice movements of the past to help participants envision a mechanism for change, in order to overcomefutility.We wanted to use these analogies to remind participants about dramatic, unforeseen social changes in the past, in the hopes they might entertain a similar change regarding animals used for food.","text",72
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Before we started testing with analogies directly, a few of our early participants made nonspecific comparisons to animal rights and other “progressive movements.” This gave us hope that there would be a non-offensive way to draw these comparisons. If such a thing exists, however, we didn’t find it. We experimented broadly with social justice movement analogies. When preparing our questions, we were careful to limit the scope of these analogies to the mechanism of change, rather than comparing the importance of the two issues: Supporters of this transition see parallels between major social changes in the past, such as the civil rights movement or the LGBT movement, where the culture and laws of this country evolved and expanded. They hope a movement to protect animals from slaughter could achieve similar changes to culture and law. Do you see any comparison to be made there? We also experimented with distant social movements that we thought would not carry much emotional charge, such as the U.S. child labor movement of the early 20th century. The response was overwhelmingly negative. Some participants who were already expressing favorable views were able to see the analogy, but far more often, people expressed disgust. Very often, people would fixate on details that, in their view, invalidated the comparison. Their disgust reaction rendered them unable or unwilling to consider the narrow comparison the question was trying to make. Analogies virtually never won over an interviewee who had been skeptical up to that point. I see the comparison. But I also think it's a pretty horrible thing to compare animal rights to the rights of actual people. No, for me, it's like night and day. You're not really eating people, or, you know, needing people to live off of… One way to interpret this pattern is to say that the general public simply is not ready for unadulterated anti-speciesist messages.","text",73
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","If that is the case, advocates should simply be mindful of how explicit they can be before becoming disconnected from the general public. This does not mean advocates should not present anti-speciesist arguments or even use the termspeciesism, merely that comparisons with other social justice movements that benefited humans are usually a bridge too far.","text",74
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Dogs, Pigs, and Cultural Relativity Of the common messages currently used by advocates that we tested, comparing pigs to dogs was the most surprising flop. By reminding people of their beloved pets, advocates hope to cause them to extend empathy and compassion to animals used for food. Essentially, this strategy creates a dilemma for the listener: either they condemn eating pigs, or condone eating dogs. Nearly all of our respondents chose the latter: That whole argument of like, would you eat a dog? …The idea of like a domesticated pet is something that's specific to cultures. For some cultures, dogs are just another animal… Some people make them pets, some people eat them. It's just a social construct. I have two dogs that I love. I would never consider eating dogs for meat. But you know, cows and pigs, they're supposed to be as smart as dogs. But I have no problem eating bacon. I've grown up eating those things. So I wouldn't consider that wrong. I wouldn't consider myself evil. But maybe in certain countries eating dogs is okay… I think it's just the way you're brought up. Advocates may be especially tempted to use this in response to theculturerationalization. For advocates, this reasoning clearly demonstrates that cultural norms can sometimes lead people to commit grievous moral harms. In practice, this message often backfired. To be sure, some participants responded favorably to this comparison, or even raised it themselves. However, these were usually people who were already sympathetic to animal advocates. In our interviews, the dog/pig comparison did not seem to play a productive role in winning people over. Low Predictive Power of the Standard “Animal Rights” Question We have repeatedly discussed how the public’s conceptual models differ substantially from those of experts. In particular, the public’s thinking reflects neither the “animal rights” nor “animal welfare” models common among experts.","text",75
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Some researchers have used a standardized question to measure the public’s support for animal rights. Respondents are asked to choose which best reflects their views from a list of three options:","text",76
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","In fact, research using this question was a key inspiration for the present study. As discussed in the beginning of this report, our goal was to investigate the large segment of people who chose the strong animal rights response yet have not aligned themselves with the animal movement. Accordingly, we asked our participants to answer this question before the interview. Comparable to other studies, one third of respondents chose the strong animal rights answer and two thirds chose the middle answer. However, even setting the interview aside, it was clear from the pre-screening form that something was amiss. Immediately after the standard question, we asked an open-ended question: “Tell the story of a particular experience you've had that caused you to think differently about how food is produced.” This question did not directly address animals, but because it came after the animal rights question, most participants discussed animals used for food. There was a striking disconnection between responses to these two questions. Consider these responses to the second question: As you might be able to guess by now, the first two respondents chose the strong animal rights answer, while the latter two chose the moderate answer. Yet at least to our research team, the latter two responses clearly suggest greater sympathies to the goals of animal advocates. The same pattern held in the interviews themselves. Here’s how a few people who gave the moderate answer responded to our very first question, “What comes to mind when you think about animals used for food?” Meanwhile, here are some first reactions from people who chose the strong animal rights response: To be clear, it’s not that people’s subjective responses werealwaysthe opposite of their response to the multiple choice question. It simply didn’t seem to correlate with people’s actual attitudes at all. What do we make of this discrepancy?","text",77
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","One explanation would be that people are in a rush to fill out a survey and aren’t putting much thought into their responses. Another is that the public’s idea of “animal rights” is different from advocates. Many of these respondents may resonate with the strong animal rights response because they believe animals have a right to be slaughtered in a certain way. Clearly this isn’t what most animal advocates are thinking of when they discuss rights for animals.","text",78
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/using-private-interviews-to-deeply-probe-the-general-publics-views-on-farming-animals/","Because this question is widely in use, its efficacy and meaning could be a valuable subject of future research. Until then, we recommend advocates consume a hefty dose of salt with any research relying on this question or questions like it. In fact, in the next report, we cast similar doubt on surveys showing that as much as 48% of the public would support a ban on slaughterhouses. 5. Conclusion: From Dialogue to Messaging Interesting survey results from the last decade suggested that there may be widespread, latent support for abolishing animal farming among the American public. These interviews were designed to identify what frames (especially values, metaphors, and narratives) underpin that support, and design messages that could activate it. While the survey results that originally inspired this study may have been misleading, we found our own clear evidence that much of the public is deeply uncomfortable with farming animals. We identified some promising frames and messaging strategies for activating pro-animal attitudes and suppressing opposition arguments. The most potent and sticky strategy was usingevolutionas a metaphor to help the public envision a gradual change away from using animals for food. Evolution plays onmodernityandprogressto effectively reframe the issue, with the help of other strategies. The next step was to see whether these findings would translate beyond the lab setting. In these interviews, we had extensive back and forth with participants over the course of half an hour. While some important advocacy happens in settings like this, our goal was to build a narrative that could perform at the macro level as well. This proved to be quite a challenge.

"https://paxfauna.org/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-empathy/","This is Part 2 of our series on Nonviolent Communication. To start with Part 1, readWhy the Animal Freedom Movement Needs Nonviolence. The Gist: This post is all about empathy. Nonviolent Communication places a big emphasis on deepening our capacity for empathy, and I believe that as animal advocates, this is relevant both to our internal relationships with other advocates and in how we engage with the public. A large part of Pax Fauna’s work is research to find best practices in messaging to convince the public about animal freedom. Now, I had already been very invested in Nonviolent Communication (NVC) when I was starting the research, but I was still amazed about how often empathy came up as a theme in our research. One phase of our research consisted of 1:1 interviews with ordinary Americans who eat meat. We asked open-ended questions and didn’t provide any retort, only occasionalcontent reflections. “Is this what you mean?” Given space to explore their own ideas, our study participants were able to talk themselves through defensive reactions and objections to animal freedom. Most participants also said that they activelytry not to think aboutanimals used for food in their daily lives, but were fully willing to think about it for our benefit. Our goal here as researchers wasn’t to trick people into talking themselves out of objections to animal rights. In fact, we were trying to avoid doing that: this stage of the research was just about understanding what they currently think. Yet, just by asking these questions and providing a non-judgmental space for people to sort through their own thoughts on the topic, we watched them transform. This is what empathy seeks to do—by accompanying others in their experiences without trying to intervene, argue, or fix, we allow them a chance to transform. When people aren’t busy defending themselves or avoiding judgment, they have more space to self-reflect and change.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-empathy/","Empathy is a vehicle for transformation Nonviolent communication is based on a radical premise:that every single thing a person does is an attempt to meet a need, and everyone’s needs matter. If we accept this premise, then we can empathize and connect even when we don’t agree with the strategy a person is using to try and meet their needs.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-empathy/","Alternatively, when we dismiss people and write them off, we cut off our ability to connect with them, and thus sever a connection that could have let them change. Empathy First This section is based on an exercise I learned fromOren-Jay Sofer. When I conduct NVC trainings, I like to talk about empathy first. That’s because the practice of empathy is probably the biggest difference we can immediately make in our conversations and conflicts to make them go better. If you can form a habit that your first response be a reflection—letting someone know that you get what they are saying or how they’re feeling—you can de-escalate some conflicts before they start. One exercise I like to do in workshops is to talk about something that bothers me, and ask for examples of things that aren’t empathy. This might sound something like the following. “I was petitioning the other day and someone said they eat meat and want to keep eating meat. I gave a response to him but he walked away without acknowledging it. I feel so frustrated with how little some people seem to engage.” The non-empathy responses I get back might sound something like these. Taking the spotlight:“Oh my gosh, last time I was petitioning I had two people say that they don’t want to give me their address because they don’t know what I’ll do with it, and they used that as an excuse not to sign! It’s so dumb because it’s actually illegal for us to use that for anything else; don’t they know that?” This is a response that might create connection in casual conversation, but I might have a sense that you didn’t really hear me before you started talking about yourself. If this was something I really needed support on, I’ll feel like you missed me. Advice:“What I like to say in those situations is, ‘Do you think animals should have to die for that?’” Questioning:“Are you sure he didn’t misunderstand what the petition was saying?” Advice and questioning can also lead to me not feeling heard.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-empathy/","In this case, I explicitly said that Ididhave a response to the person who wouldn’t sign the petition and I was feeling frustrated because the person wouldn’t engage with me. But even if I hadn’t shared this information, hearing advice on what my response should be misses the mark entirely. Advice and questioning can trigger me to feel defensive—I wonder if you’re assuming that I use a bad pitch when I’m petitioning. Either way, the conversation has moved away from my experience.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-empathy/","Sometimes, asking for advice (what should I do?) or validation (am I being crazy here?) is a veiled way of asking for empathy. I don’t mean that people who ask for emotional support in the form of advice are being dishonest. Rather, our dominant culture doesn’t have very much language around asking for empathy, so advice language is the best we can sometimes do. So, when you’re asked for advice on a charged topic, I recommend considering offering a few reflections of empathy first to let the person know that you’ve heard them. If they still want advice after that, they’ll tell you. If empathy meets the need in full, they might generate their own solution (and it might be better than what you were about to suggest!). Analysis:“People are so defensive. They have their retort and just aren’t willing to think about it anymore.” Diagnosing:“Sounds like a sociopath.” These might be connecting if it tells me that you’re getting my perspective, and they might not. Remember, when I’m talking about something I’m having an emotional reaction to, I’m really talking about myself. Talking about the people who set me off might be a miss. It also might be escalating, guiding me more towards my own judgments instead of letting me move through my feelings. Minimizing:“That kind of thing happens; just move on to the next person.” Optimism:“Well, you’re always planting seeds.” Lecture:“I think we really need to be understanding as a movement that not everyone can see things from our point of view right away. We have to be patient.” These kinds of reactions skip empathy. You see where you’d like the person (in this case, me) to be, and you suggest that they go there. What you’re missing is the necessary step of empathy in between having a feeling and resolving that feeling. Given a little bit of empathy, people often find themselves generating their own advice, analysis, optimism, and so on. Before receiving empathy, these responses can feel terribly alienating. Who is the focus on?","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-empathy/","What all of these non-empathy responses have in common is that they turn the focus on the listener instead of keeping it on the speaker. It’s as if we’ve jumped up and turned the spotlight onto ourselves in the middle of someone else’s solo. When we talk about the skill of empathy, we’re talking about practicing deep listening, which helps people know that they’ve been heard, thus deepening relationships and preventing conflict. Deep, empathetic listening means listening with a different quality than we usually do. It means speaking in a way that keeps the spotlight on the person who is sharing. The exchange might sound something like this:","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-empathy/","“I was petitioning the other day and someone said they eat meat and want to keep eating meat. I gave him a response but he walked away without acknowledging it. I feel so frustrated with how little some people seem to engage.” Empathy: “I hear that frustration. Would it be so nice to be given a chance at being understood?” This kind of response, we hope, will give the speaker a sense that we’re really listening and willing to engage about their experience. So let’s break it down and figure out what it takes to respond that way. Elements of Empathy In NVC, giving someone empathy usually refers to guessing whatfeelingsandneedsyou heard in what they said, but of course, we can feel supported even when our feelings and needs aren’t reflected back to us. Empathy is a mutually felt sense that you’re being understood, and there are four different ways that is often achieved. Presence In the context of a supportive relationship, an attentive, silent presence alone can be enough to communicate empathy. Understanding This one works well in situations where low emotional vulnerability is desired, such as in a workplace or with someone you don’t know well, or when someone’s describing a complex situation and you’re able to follow it. Repeating back thecontentof what someone says can help them feel heard. When I’m giving NVC presentations and get to this point in the Elements of Empathy discussion, I like to ask how I’m doing. “Would anyone be willing to repeat back what I’ve said so far about understanding, so I know I’m making sense?” If I’m lucky, someone will volunteer to say, “If you repeat back the content of what someone said, that can be empathy too.” In doing so, they’ll provide a perfect example of anunderstandingreflection. When I hear it, I know I’ve been gotten—I’m not just talking into the void. Somebody hears me! This meets my needs for contribution and competence. You can offer others in your life the gift of understanding, even when they don’t ask.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-empathy/","Sometimes it can help to give a little preamble, so they know you’re not necessarily agreeing or taking credit for their idea. You can say something like, “Is it okay if I repeat back what I’m hearing so I can be sure I’m getting it?”","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-empathy/","Feelings and Needs NVC considers feelings and needs the main ingredients of empathy. If I understand what you’re feeling and what needs are alive, then I’m able to empathize. Feelings and needs will be discussed in depth in Part 3, but they include things like feeling lonely because you have an unmet need for companionship, or feeling rejuvenated because your need for leisure time has been met. Empathy example I love learning about and teaching NVC in a workshop setting because we can use lifelike examples. In this blog, I’ll write out what such an everyday NVC conversation could sound like. Note thatspeakerandlistenerare the titles used because the modality thrives on this distinction. In casual conversation, we alternate between being a speaker and listener quickly and often, but in a practice setting, we’ll stick with one role for a while to fully inhabit it. So, in this example, the speaker and listener keep their roles throughout. Speaker: “I’m so frustrated with these cupcake vegans. Why even be vegan if you don’t care enough to come to a protest?” The speaker’s use of a judgmental term, “cupcake vegan” (sometimes used to refer to vegans whose interest in veganism is limited to food and not advocacy), doesn’t stop us from being able to empathize. Listener: “I hear how frustrating it is that more people aren’t coming out to protests. Is that about a sense of collaboration to you?”We reflect back the feeling the speaker mentioned, “frustrated”, along with a guess at a need, “collaboration.” Let’s see if it lands. Speaker: “Yeah, every time I go to a vegan event it seems like a great idea—there are usually a couple dozen people who come to these dinners, but hardly ever is anyone interested in talking about activism, let alone coming out.” It’s unclear if our last guess landed—she’s moved on to a different aspect of the situation. Let’s come with her and make a guess about what she just shared.","text",12
"https://paxfauna.org/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-empathy/","Listener: “Ugh, that sounds so disappointing, is it?”We guess a feeling and phrase it like a question. We aren’t telling her how she feels, just asking.","text",13
"https://paxfauna.org/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-empathy/","Speaker: “Yeah, it’s disappointing. But honestly I don’t even care anymore. I’m just going to put my head down and do the work, and if people want to join, they can, but I’m not going to bother with the vegan group anymore.” Notice how the speaker has moved on to talking about what she’s going to do about the situation (or not do). You might feel tempted to give advice at this point, and it might be welcome, but I suspect that continuing to give empathy will work better. Let’s try another empathy guess. Listener: “Are you just feeling defeated after so many tries to invite people without any interest?”Her last share was content-heavy, so after we guessed the feeling, “defeated,” we added in a little bit of her story to let her know we’re following. Speaker: “Well, no, I mean, we have a steady group of people coming out, and sometimes they bring friends. It just seems like, with so many vegans in this city, our protests should be huge.” I guess she wants to change the world, and don’t we all? What need is that? Purpose? Contribution? Those sound so small compared to what she’s talking about now. Let’s use a metaphor to try to show that we’re really getting the enormity of it. Listener: “Is it almost like you’re trying to start a fire, and you know you have all the elements there—you have dry fuel and sparks and air—and you just keep adding paper but the logs won’t catch?” In workshops, we spend a bit of time practicing this skill of empathy. We take turns sharing something we’d like empathy on, and others practice the skill of staying with our feelings and needs without advice, debate, reassurance, etc. We call theseempathy groupsor, when in pairs,empathy buddies.This practice is easy to self-organize in small groups and pairs. In one of my first NVC workshop experiences in 2020, I was assigned another participant as a practice partner. She and I continue to meet weekly today.","text",14
"https://paxfauna.org/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-empathy/","I very much recommend finding others to practice with on a regular basis, both to hone the skill of empathy and to receive empathic support yourself.","text",15
"https://paxfauna.org/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-empathy/","It’s difficult to summarize the impact that a study of NVC has had on my life. I’m less stressed by conflict now, and the conflicts I have go better. I makerequests(and receive yeses!) to things I never would have thought to ask for before. And, I have new tools and rituals to manage when I’m up late at night fuming about something that happened three years ago. It’s not a magic spell– it doesn’t mean that I never have to apologize, that I haven’t lost any friends in conflict, or that I always sleep well. But I’m beyond hopeful that making time to study NVC will be well worthwhile. In the next piece in this series, the building blocks of empathy are described in more detail:Feelings and Needs.

"https://paxfauna.org/facilitating-conflict-making-requests-in-nonviolent-communication/","This series is an attempt to put the content of Eva’s NVC trainings online into a readable format. This blog will cover preliminary concepts in Nonviolent Communication, which will help in understanding later blogs in this series. Part One coveredwhy we study nonviolence, Part Two covered thepractice of empathy, and Part Three covered the building blocks of empathy,feelings and needs. Here is Part Four, covering observations and requests. The Gist: Observations Observations are clear descriptions of what happened in a particular time, stated in a way that minimizes evaluation and judgment. For example, “You don’t respect me” isn’t an observation, while “You began speaking while I was still speaking” is. The purpose of NVC observation is to share clarity about what we’re talking about in a way the other person can hear. While judgments and evaluations can spark defensiveness in conflict, observations are a strategy to get on the same page about the stimulus without blame, judgment, and subsequent defensiveness. Early in the development of NVC, people used to talk about observations as the sort of things that can be captured by a video camera—only what we can perceive with our external sense. I prefer a broader version of “observations” presented by my teacher Roxy Manning, which includes internal and systemic events as well. For example, telling someone about a traumatic flashback that was triggered by an external stimulus is considered an observation, as is a statistic or knowledge about systemic problems. The inclusion of these is important to allow us to share the breadth of our observations in a way that matches our experience of the world while still holding NVC’s distinction between observation and judgment. At times, naming observations will help you speak in a way that is met with less defensiveness. At other times, it might feel important to reflect someone else’s judgment in order to connect with them.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/facilitating-conflict-making-requests-in-nonviolent-communication/","And of course, judgment is synonymous withreasoning;we create stories about the world and act on them in order to make decisions big and small every day. Owning and naming these judgments can be important and life-serving.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/facilitating-conflict-making-requests-in-nonviolent-communication/","Requests NVC requests are clear, specific, and use positive action language whenever possible. Clear requests contain the information necessary to fulfill the request. “Listen to me more” doesn’t contain the information necessary, while “Put your phone down and make eye contact with me while we’re talking” does. Positive action language asks someone to do something, rather than not to do something. Running children may understand “walk” better than “don’t run.” What distinguishes requests from demands? A demand is a request paired with a stated or implicit threat of punishment or retaliation. When we hear demands, it can bring up a need for autonomy and cue us to decline the request in order to protect our own freedom. Or, the threat of retaliation, real or imagined, can lead us to agree to strategies that wouldn’t meet our needs. We can imagine requests and demands existing on a spectrum. The more trust we have that other ways to meet our needs exist, and the more curiosity we have about others’ needs, the more likely our own requests will be heard as requests and not demands. As an example, let’s take theLiberation Pledgewhich I’ve previously written about. Upon taking the pledge, we ask people in our lives not to eat animal products in front of us.Howwe ask can determine whether the other person hears what we say as a request or a demand. The latter may be more likely to be heard as a request and, paradoxically, be more likely to result in a solution that we want even while preserving the relationship. There certainly is a time and place for demands or even force, such as to stop certain and immediate harm, but using coercion always has a cost to the relationship. Consciousness around making true requests can help us to be intentional about when we’re deciding to pay that cost and when we’re trying to stay in connection. Requests are hard Requests can be scary. It’s a vulnerable thing to ask for our needs to be met, because it risks hearing a no.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/facilitating-conflict-making-requests-in-nonviolent-communication/","Wouldn’t it be nice if everyone could just intuit what we need or want?","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/facilitating-conflict-making-requests-in-nonviolent-communication/","Some people come to NVC because they communicate too aggressively and want to learn to be kinder. Others are too passive and want to learn to be more assertive. Again, this work is about nonviolence. In the same way that nonviolent direct action confronts systems of oppression without violence, we want to be able to bravely face (and even initiate) hard conversations with unflinching nonviolence. One thing that can make requests less scary is to first make smaller requests about a conversation you want to have,beforesuggesting that anybody change their behavior. In NVC we call this aconnection request. Connection Requests NVC’s unique contribution to the conversation about requests is the concept of aconnection request. While asolution requestconcerns the subject of the conversation, connection requests are all the little requests we make during a conversation about the conversation itself. They check to see if we’re still in connection and ask for consent to take the conversation in a given direction. A common error in making requests is offering solution requests too early in a conversation, before both parties trust that they have been fully heard. This might result in resistance or misunderstanding. Connection requests allow us to facilitate a conversation toward greater connection and understanding and thus toward solutions. Examples of connection requests For a conversation:""I'd like to talk about what happened the other day. It's really important to me that our relationship feels comfortable and trusting for both us. Could we take a walk tomorrow and talk then?"" To offer empathy:“I want to make sure I’m getting it. Can I repeat back what I heard?” For understanding:""I just said a lot and I'm not sure that it all made sense.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/facilitating-conflict-making-requests-in-nonviolent-communication/","Would you mind letting me know what you heard so I can be sure I came across okay?""“To make sure we’re on the same page, would you let me know your impression of what we just agreed on?” For empathy (feelings):""It would help me to know that you have a sense of how I'm feeling about all this. Can you tell me how you imagine I am feeling?""","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/facilitating-conflict-making-requests-in-nonviolent-communication/","For empathy (needs):""Would you mind letting me know what seems important to me in what I just said?"" Many people may find it unusual to hear a request that they give you a specific form of empathy, as in the examples above. A preface might help your request land. Try saying, ""I'm sure you have a lot to say in response, but first– would you mind letting me know what seems important to me in what I just said?"""" For responses:""I'm wondering, how do you feel having heard all of that?""""What comes up for you, hearing that?""""What would you like me to understand?"" To move towards solutions:“I’m thinking of some ideas for how to move forward- is this a good time to share those?”“Are you open to talking about how we could do it differently in the future?” Solution Requests Solution requests are the requests we might usually think of, yet they are made much less frequently in Nonviolent Communication. The guiding principle is that if both parties can deeply hear each other first, they’re likely to be able to come up with a solution together that meets everyone’s needs, so the emphasis is placed on building understanding rather than negotiating. That said, the NVC advice for solution requests is to try to have at least a few in mind when we go into a high-stakes conversation. That way, when we learn that our first request won’t meet others’ needs, we have other ideas that might. And remember, if you are feeling nervous about proposing a solution, it might be good to request connection first! Once your connection requests have given you a chance to debrief observations, feelings, and needs, here are some examples of solution requests: ""Going forward, would you be willing to try to clean your dishes within an hour of using them?"" ""Could we brainstorm a few ideas for how to hold each other accountable?"" ""I think it would really help if you read this article before we talk next.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/facilitating-conflict-making-requests-in-nonviolent-communication/","Does that sound doable?"" Consent in Nonviolent Communication People who are drawn to a communication practice like NVC tend to be socially conscientious and want to respect others. Naturally, some have raised concerns aboutconsentwhen having these discussions. Indeed, it is possible to end up in a conversation with someone that ends up feeling too vulnerable to one party. The Connection Requests that we have talked about aim to address this problem. By checking in with consent as we go about a conversation, it is more likely we can all walk away feeling that our needs for respect, privacy, dignity, and choice have been met.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/facilitating-conflict-making-requests-in-nonviolent-communication/","On the other hand, consent is a word often associated with sex, and in that context is fraught with moral weight. Consent cannot hold the same moral weight in the context of having conversations with each other to resolve conflict. When we relate with people, we have conflicts inevitably, and to get to a place of peaceful resolution usually requires at least some discussion of what’s going on with us. We can’t opt out of conflicts in the same way we can opt out of physical contact, nor can we draw clear lines between which kinds of communication require consent upfront– especially when we aren’t the ones initiating conversation. Instead, we have to do the best we can with the resources we have available to us at the time. We will make mistakes, and we will learn. If we can remember that NVC is not about right and wrong but rather about having more connecting conversations, then we’re open to a creative application of the skills we learn that work for the individual we’re talking to. What About Power? Power can make the most gentle request language land like a demand, or a strong request feel like a gentle suggestion. Imagine an employee hearing from their boss, “Do you mind coming in this weekend?” It’s quite possible that the employee would understand that they’d be punished– or even fired– for saying no. Vulnerability can also be magnified by power differentials. People with more power can avoid asking for too much vulnerability by guessing at needs rather than feelings or guessing at milder versions of feelings, and by letting the other person set the time and place for the conversation. Stay tuned for later blogs that will explore these dynamics in more depth. Moving forward So far, we’ve covered the basics of Nonviolent Communication: empathy, observations, feelings, needs, and requests. The next blog in the series will present some exercises to begin your practice. Get updates from Pax Fauna","text",12

"https://paxfauna.org/facilitating-conflict-making-requests-in-nonviolent-communication/","Hi Madeline,It can definitely be difficult to hear a ""no"", and that can be a time for self-empathy or to ask for empathy for someone else. After that, needs can be met in many different ways. If one person isn't interested or able to help us meet a need, it might take some creativity to figure out another way to have our need met. For example, if I have a request that my family eats a vegan meal, to meet my needs to integrity and togetherness, and my family declines, I might find that skipping the meal will meet my needs for integrity, and an alternative plan that isn't around food, or even isn't with the same people, might meet my needs for togetherness.

"https://paxfauna.org/reclaiming-our-animal-emotions-nonviolent-communication-for-advocates/","Who wears her heart on her sleeve? I recently volunteered at a high volume spay/neuter clinic in the Navajo Nation. Watching a large Shepherd mix walk to her crate to await surgery, I was struck by the unselfconsciousness of her emotional expression. She pulled on her leash and darted from side to side, with her nose to the ground and a low wag of her tail- a picture of anxiety. I imagined myself going to a conference, nervous for a presentation and whether I’d be caught forgetting someone’s name, and how automatically I’d try to hide my emotions- masking my facial expressions, holding my hands still, forcing my gaze to move at a slower pace.  If I was very successful, I might hide my emotions so well that I’d hide them from myself, only considering that I might be nervous when I made too many errors with my words or turned around so frantically that I spilled someone’s coffee. Or, I might never notice my nervousness, and only see evidence of generalized stress as bad news at my annual checkup. Emotionality is to beinganimalwhat rationality is to beinghuman.This simplification of a human- animal binary suggests that development and understanding of our own emotionality is in advocates’ interest in breaking down this binary. When we can experience ourselves as fully human and fully animal, we can begin to free ourselves from deeply internalized beliefs in white human supremacy. Without a deep familiarity with our own emotional landscape, we risk forgetting our animality and thinking of ourselves as superior to emotional creatures. Animals as a political category In their book, Afroism1, sisters Aph and Syl Ko offer thatanimal is a political categoryin addition to a biological one, much in the way that discussion of biological sex is often a stand-in for the political concept of gender.Animalhere is a concept that allows some individuals, including certain humans, to be excluded from moral relevance.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/reclaiming-our-animal-emotions-nonviolent-communication-for-advocates/","We can imagine a spectrum where whiteness and maleness is more human while blackness and femininity are less so. This provides a psychological basis to the coherence of Trump’s remarks about migrants as animals or the many animal-inspired racist or sexist epithets. “Animal” or “ape” only make sense as an insult whereanimalmeans distance from an ideal human.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/reclaiming-our-animal-emotions-nonviolent-communication-for-advocates/","Other traits, biologically independent of but sometimes politically associated with gender and race, also contribute to one’s place on the politicalhuman- animal spectrum. Folks with intellectual disabilities are sometimes referred to astrainableoreducableto differentiate them on the extent of their disability. The language oftrainingsome humans andeducatingothers provides thatsome humans are animals1,in the words of the Ko Sisters, while racist beliefs about black folks’ proclivities towards violence result in huge numbers literally caged. When I was a child, a grey and white cat showed up in our family and decided that our home was hers. Soon after, a kitten with similar markings arrived in the same way. We began differentiating them as the big cat and little cat, imagining them to be temporary visitors, but as they became members of our family, the names stuck. I remember sometimes fixing my gaze on Little Cat and trying to understand that she was an animal.An animal,I’d repeat in my mind, straining to imagine her to be of the same Kingdom as racoons darting across the road at night, or of bears I’d delightedly ogle at the local zoo. Sometimes I’d get a glimpse of her in this way, a brief flash of Little Cat as a body with fur and claws-animalrather than, well, Little Cat. More often than not, she’d respond to my staring with a meow or a nuzzle that pulled me back into interaction before I could see her as anything but family. I felt sure of her discomfort in these moments, that she didn’t like these experiments of mine- didn’t like the way I looked at her and maybe even the distance I might inject between us when I tried understanding her asanimal. Imagine a spectrum, with white men in suits at one end- themosthuman, and chickens in factory farms far towards the other. When we consider these most human individuals, we find individuals socialized to be the least permitted to emote.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/reclaiming-our-animal-emotions-nonviolent-communication-for-advocates/","Conversely, the least human humans- imagine women, black folks, and children- are painted as ruled by emotions. Animal advocates often argue that animals are capable of experiencing emotion, as a way to plead for their moral consideration, but where has our own ability to experience emotion gotten us with the power holders of the world? How expert are themost humanamong us at experiencing the full range of their own emotions?","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/reclaiming-our-animal-emotions-nonviolent-communication-for-advocates/","A common retort to advocates’ pictures of animals’ friendships, loyalty, humor, and trauma is an accusation ofanthropomorphizing,a ten dollar word for a fully semantic argument, even when Humanness means more rationality and less emotional expression. Perhaps instead of saying animals experience human emotions, we should argue that humans experienceanimal emotions. As obvious as this sounds on its face, I invite you to occasionally pause and name the emotion you’re experiencing under the assumption that you are, indeed, experiencing an emotion. Can you name the subtleties of responses to everyday stimuli, or the tinges of emotions you might feel embarrassed to admit to- and also name that embarrassment? Are you fully aligned with the emotional motivations of your actions, or are you able to believe that any decision is made without emotion? Can you feel an internal shift when an emotion is named? What would you call that sensation? Nonviolent Communication and Naming Emotions Studying nonviolent communication (NVC) involves developing one’s ability toself-connectand name emotions, separating them from judgements, stories, or other pseudo rationality. A striking but routine occurrence in many beginners of NVC, especially, in my experience, older men, is the discovery of a hugely limited vocabulary for naming emotions. We might report feeling good, ill, or angry, and have significant difficulty in naming a greater spread of feelings. Our invitation to develop your ability to experience and express emotions is motivated by my disgust at the strength of the ideological boundary between humans and animals and its consequences for individuals whose interests are dismissed asanimal. (Again, human and otherwise.) I hope that an invitation to develop both awareness and acceptance of emotions is an invitation to understand yourself asanimal, as a natural and emotional being. Nothing here is meant to reject rationality orhumanness.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/reclaiming-our-animal-emotions-nonviolent-communication-for-advocates/","In fact, we believe that the more we develop our ability to self-connect, the more perfectly we’re able to be rational. Indeed, emotions that aren’t named do not just disappear. They manifest as motivations, thoughts, and even illnesses whose cause we may not be aware of. Only after acknowledging emotions can we truly decide how or when to act on them.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/reclaiming-our-animal-emotions-nonviolent-communication-for-advocates/","Humans and species-specific behavior In our research, we sometimes hear our subjects disgusted with theunnaturalnessof factory farm environments, where animals are denied the opportunity to performspecies specific behaviors.Imagine pigs rooting in the dirt, chickens dust bathing, and cows nursing their young. Similarly, we sometimes look with concern at highly trained dogs and wonder if they’re ever allowed the chance to dig and play tug of war- behaviors we see as important to the well being of members of their species- or if they’re so disciplined that they never indulge in such delights. The practice of naming our emotions is vital to the wellbeing of the human animal. Think of it as one of our species specific behaviors. Although trained, to varying degrees, to suppress this inclination, the internal process of naming emotions shifts the nervous system in these animals in ways that are easily observable in a laboratory setting2. The value of naming emotions- resonance Human brains possess an amazing ability to self regulate- to experience a soothing effect ofresonancesimply by naming our own emotions. We learn this ability in childhood if we have a warm and responsive primary caregiver, and later through warm and secure relationships with important others. Continuing the development of this skill is a precious species-specific behavior to humans that allows us to regulate our own nervous systems and thus improve our quality of life, effectiveness of our work, and our physical health.2 Naming emotions is acknowledging our animal nature Breaking down the human- animal binary means that we needn’t choose a place on the spectrum to occupy, but that we can defiantly pursue both the fullness of our humanness and animalness at once. We can be in full connection with our intellect and emotional selves and never see them in conflict.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/reclaiming-our-animal-emotions-nonviolent-communication-for-advocates/","By studying nonviolent communication or other life affirming self-connection modalities, we can reject a restrictive view of what it means to be human and therefore begin to break down a human-animal binary that allows some individuals to be treated as less than human.","text",11

"https://paxfauna.org/vegan-tables-a-letter-to-the-people-i-love/","Eva posing with Anna, who was rescued from a breeding and testing facility This blog is part of a three-part series. To learn more about the pledge, start withPart 1 If you know me, you know that I’ve been heavily involved in the animal freedom movement for years. I’ve been inside factory farms housing pigs, cows, and chickens and I’ve seen unspeakable suffering in each. I’ve looked into the eyes of countless animals nearing slaughter and carried only a precious few to safety. I’ve been arrested and charged with felonies for the work, and I gave up a meaningful career in hospice care to give more of my time and energy to the movement. I did all this because I believe the cause is profoundly important, a matter of life and death.  In turn, these experiences have further shaped my worldview. My purpose for this letter is not to convince you to share my beliefs; I only ask that you understand me. You know that my work is about animal advocacy, but in spending time with my loved ones, I’m not just an advocate for animals- I’m a sister and a daughter who wants to be understood for what my inner world is like. I know I haven’t always communicated the way I want to about this. I’ve probably spoken in a way that felt like an attack on you. I imagine there’s a lasting impact from some of those conversations, and I’m sorry for that. Of course, I care about animals, and I want people to agree with me that their suffering matters, but on the other hand, that belief causesmeso much suffering that I almost envy those who don’t share it, or who have made peace with this way of the world. Are you willing to hear what it’s like for me? In my world, animals used for food are fully conscious beings. Their lives and deaths are the stuff of nightmares. I won’t get too graphic, but they experience unspeakable pain, grieve when separated from their families, and every single one of them experiences the same terror at slaughter that you or I would.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/vegan-tables-a-letter-to-the-people-i-love/","Again, I’m not asking you to agree that this is true, but to consider what it might feel like for me to believe that it is.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/vegan-tables-a-letter-to-the-people-i-love/","You can think of it as constant grief that never fades because the loss is still occurring, day by day, second by second. It usually isn’t overpowering- I can be absorbed in other things and experience a rich life for myself, but I encounter reminders dozens of times each day. Some of them are subtle- like when someone mentions their dinner plans, which I suspect include eating an animal. Other reminders are much more acute, like when I walk by a recognizable body part on display in a restaurant window. Piled on top of that is the guilt I feel every time I don’t speak up. I see people fishing in the park, and I wonder if there’s something I could say to prevent someone from suffocating to death in the next few minutes. I wonder if someone will die this way because of my cowardice, my unwillingness to intervene. I wonder if there’s something I should be saying at all sorts of moments to at least try to prevent the suffering of some animal or another. There’s a sense of paralysis that comes with having so many times where I think I should say something as if to speak up once I’d need to speak up every time. So I almost never do. The main part of this experience I want you to understand is what it’s like for me to sit and socialize when someone’s eating an animal. I can choose between disengaging emotionally to avoid the pain, verbally addressing the violence I perceive on the table, or avoiding the situation entirely. As you can imagine, I encounter this agonizing decision all the time. I want to let you in on this part of my world because I care about our relationship. I don’t want to relate to you in a way that holds such a large part of myself back; I want you to know what it’s like to be me. I also share this to give you some information about what might make our relationship more comfortable for me.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/vegan-tables-a-letter-to-the-people-i-love/","If you’re willing, when we eat together or attend an event where food is served, it would do so much to help me feel seen and welcome if you decided to go without animal products. I ask this of you, specifically, because you’re someone I feel close to and supported by. I know that not everyone will oblige to this request, and I don’t make it of everyone.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/vegan-tables-a-letter-to-the-people-i-love/","I want to hear what this is like for you to read, and I’m happy to answer any questions. I especially want to hear if any part of this letter comes across as an attack or a judgment because that’s fully not what I intend. I understand that we have different outlooks on this subject, and I really do accept that. In my work, I’m not interested in making more vegans- I want to see a world where the incentives are changed, and it isn’t so difficult to go without eating animals. In my personal life, this request could help me stay present with the people I love. Get updates from Pax Fauna","text",8

"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","Fork bracelets inscribed withLiberation, photo courtesyEnvisionPositive This blog is part of a three-part series. To learn more about the Pledge, start withPart 1. In 2015, I told my family that I couldn’t come to Christmas dinner if they were eating an animal. This was my first act in taking the Liberation Pledge, a public oath to live vegan, refuse to sit at tables where animals are being eaten, and encourage others to do the same. Along with many others, mostly in affiliation with the grassroots animal liberation network Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), I took the Pledge as an honest expression of my own integrity and believed it to be a potent strategy for social change. In hindsight, the Pledge did not have the strategic value we imagined it would, but I’m hopeful that its essence can be expressed constructively- to allow animal advocates to energize their social networks to create change. In this post, I’ll make a proposal to do just that. In contrast with a pledge that we promise to follow in every situation, with every person, the new Liberation Pledge is a promise to have brave conversations with people we’re close to, where a solution is found in collaboration with the other. To this day, I don’t want to sit at tables while animals are being eaten. If I do, I face a difficult choice. I have the option to emotionally disengage from what’s happening, not to think of who is being eaten and what their presence means. If I choose this, then to some extent I disengage emotionally from the people around me. In this case, I’m not bringing my whole self to the table. In some situations, this option surely makes the most sense. Practitioners of the Pledge generally understood this. We might have “broken” the Pledge or simply not practiced it in certain situations. For example, while I took the Pledge around family and friends, I never made such demands at work. Instead, I chose to prioritize the work itself and engage on more of a surface level with my colleagues.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","But in other situations, I don’t want to attend and disengage. Then, to fully include myself, I need to ask others to accommodate my emotional needs by refraining from eating animals.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","That's where the request comes in, our update to the second tenet of the Liberation Pledge. This is our proposed strategy to achieve the original goal of the Pledge, which was to change the norms around eating animals using the strength of our closest social relationships, while at the same time deepening those relationships. Nonviolence ain’t easy Of courseyou’re angry about what’s happening to animals. I’m angry too. It breaks my heart to know that people who know and love me continue to eat animals’ bodies. Of course we sometimes want to yell or blame or threaten that we aren’t coming to Christmas if they can’t have one goddamn vegan meal in their lives. But nonviolence asks us toaccept sacrifice, for the sake of the cause, to achieve a goal.Sometimes that sacrifice looks like a glamorous photo of civil disobedience, but more often, it’s about building the discipline we need to win people over. It means dealing with our own emotions first, so that when we show up to try to do the work the world needs, we’re intentional, emotionally generous, and unflinchingly nonviolent. What if the most important struggle for animal activists takes place not outside factory farms or in politicians’ offices, but at theirfamily’s dinner table? How would we approach our strongest relationships if we truly believed they were the most valuable resource we have to create social change? Our answer is the request. Steps of the Request Understand that conflict is a vehicle for connection. The request can have a political effect, but that’s not why you’re doing it. It’s about your personal comfort in connection with others, and that’s okay. When you make the request, you’re inviting someone into your world and asking to be understood. When you engage with directness and empathy about the ways that you aren’t currently meeting each other’s needs, you open a door to greater honesty and closeness.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","Let’s consider a more radical abandonment of the political framing:Your family doesn’t have to accept any part of your worldview for this to workso long as they can empathize with your experience.Here’s an extreme example. In the TV showBetter Call Saul,an attorney named Chuck believed that he had a condition called Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity (EMS), causing him to live without electricity and often wrapped in a foil blanket. While his condition is portrayed as psychosomatic, his law firm turned off everything electric so that Chuck could come to a meeting for an important case. That decision had nothing to do with the existence of EMS as a condition outside of Chuck’s mind and everything to do with their respect for the founding partner of their firm. They only needed to accepthis experienceof the world, not any objective truth about it, to, quite literally, meet him at the table.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","Similarly, for this request, your family only needs to accept that inyour reality,animals are sentient and what’s happening to them is terrifying and heartbreaking. They don’t have to accept that this is objectively true. By explicitly putting aside who’s right, you can allow the request to live in your connection without it requiring the examination of psychological defense mechanisms around eating animals. You can talk to the person themselves, the one who cares about you and doesn’t want to cause you unnecessary suffering, without talking to the part of them that needs to defend itself. While the early framing of the Liberation Pledge talked about using your social capital to create a cultural stigma around eating animals, it missed the mechanism by which this can happen- empathic connection, where our loved ones feel generously enough towards us to consider our world and feel pain onourbehalf. By accepting that their realities may differ from ours and not, in this conversation, asking that they feel empathic pain on behalf of animals themselves, we have a chance at making the request from a place of real connection. This is a great strategy to help them eventually empathize with animals, but it will work better if you focus on the connection,notthe strategy. Consider what level of conflict the relationship can hold at this point. Back to the example of EMS in Better Call Saul, it’s important to the example that Chuck was a respected partner of the firm. With such a high need for accommodations for the most basic of participation, he was generally only shown interacting with those who respected him greatly. Consider, who are you to the people you’re making this request of? If they asked you to accommodate them in a way that might be emotionally difficult for you, would you be likely to challenge yourself to serve the relationship?","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","If not, it might make more sense to take care of yourself in a way that doesn’t rely on strength the relationship doesn’t have right now, and save the difficult conversation of the request for people you’re more invested in.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","Empathy A paradoxical mantra of Nonviolent Communication is thatit’s hard to listen if you haven’t been heard.The paradox lies in the fact that it’s true for both parties, but only one person gets to be heard first, often leading to an emotional standoff where people in conflict talk past each other. If we, as practitioners of nonviolence, can offer to do the hearing first and frequently, we can break that vicious cycle and be more likely to have a connective conversation. In the first part of the conversation, be prepared to communicate the following messages, in words that are as natural to you and your relationship as possible. Request The practical difference between the original Liberation Pledge and our update is that the original Pledge was delivered in a static state, “I don’t sit at tables where animals are being eaten” where the outcome of the updated Pledge is determined through conversationin collaborationwith the other. “I’m thinking about Thanksgiving and feeling pretty worried about how I’ll feel with a turkey there. What’s coming up for you hearing that much? I think I understand, am I getting it? Are you open to hearing more about what’s coming up for me? How is that to hear? How would it be for you to… go without the turkey? Let me prepare a main dish instead? Have me visit after dinner? What ideas do you have for how we can work this out?” Another difference in this proposal is to rethink our request asspecific to a relationship, not a table or event. This can set us up for more realistic positive outcomes and help us invest our energy in productive ways. You might choose to attend a large family reunion where animals are being eaten and only make the request to those you most know and trust, letting their show of solidarity be a signal to others. Repeat The more we can accept that this conversation is pretty difficult for the people we’re talking to, and stay in it with patience, the more likely we’ll have a connecting outcome.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","While the framing presented here is meant to reduce defensiveness, your loved ones will likely be carrying some messages from their own discomfort with eating animals, from what they’ve heard from others, and maybe even from what they’ve heard from you in the past.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","Expect to continuously return to empathy- letting them know what you’re hearing is important to them, and checking to see if you got it right- as long as it takes. What about relationships that we’re willing to end over this? Conflict is extremely hard, and working through it in relationships usually takes much more time and energy than we expect. Practicing nonviolence doesn’t mean investing fully in every relationship or every conflict. Sometimes, you might not be willing to sit at a table or attend an event without the request being met fully and immediately, and you may not have the kind of relationship where you want to be so vulnerable as to share the pain of living in a world with the awareness of animals that you have. In these cases, you might not decide to have a conversation about it. You might suggest a vegan restaurant or a walk in the park instead of lunch, or you might just decline an invitation. If you do decide to have a conversation, I recommend the same steps as above, with only as much investment in empathy as you’re willing to give, and with a blameless acceptance of the possibility that you might not be compatible dining companions. What the Original Pledge Got Right There are certainly elements of the Pledge that we’re preserving. Firstly, the Pledge asked us to be willing to make ourselves uncomfortable to act in accordance with our values. The bravery that Pledgers developed, and their willingness to withstand social pressure for a cause, is an undeniable positive outcome, and a central tenant of the updated Liberation Pledge. Interactions that are awkward or clunky are not a sign of failure- they’re a necessary part of developing a new skill. While this model doesn’t demand a public commitment to have a conversation at every opportunity, it does contain the request that we push ourselves to show up authentically in these conversations, even when it’s hard.","text",12
"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","In fact, a display of nervousness or anxiety around the conversation can be another way to show how much your loved ones matter to you.","text",13

I invite you to dust off your fork bracelet or bend a new one if you like, and wear it as a reminder to yourself to be brave, honest, and kind.

But to say, “I was too cowardly to actually do it and besides it probably wouldn’t have worked anyway,” ...that is pretty upsetting! I took the Pledge to set firm and reasonable boundaries with people. Carnism gives people blinders and they have trouble understanding that there even is a boundary. The Pledge gave me something concrete I could point to and send people off to cope with on their own time at their own pace, instead of me having to try and coach them through it every time this common social issue comes up. If DxE wants to try something else, they should go right ahead. But I’m super disappointed to see that they are winding down the Pledge.

"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","Hi Mike, I hear how useful the Pledge is to you for setting boundaries for yourself, how much work it is to coach them through it every time, and how important the simplicity of a boundary can be. I'm also getting how important the integrity of the Pledge is- that it doesn't become something so flexible that it's meaningless. Am I getting it? I want to clarify that I did take the Pledge. To this day, my family celebrates holidays with fully vegan meals despite me being the only vegan, and that's very important to me. I've seen a lot of good and bad outcomes of the Pledge, and I want to suggest a way we can talk about the Pledge that emphasizes its transformative potential. To me, while it's useful to know that I can refuse to sit anywhere I don't want to sit, the most important positive outcomes of the Pledge were the honest conversations it caused. I also want to clarify that this isn't DxE. The Liberation Pledge was started by people who were involved in DxE at the time, but it hasn't been a DxE project for years. Recently, its creators turned the website over to Pax Fauna. Far from winding down the Pledge, we're working on relaunching it in a way that makes the most of its potential to energize the movement through personal relationships.","text",23

I thought that leaving up all the content while pointing to the blogs was a way to hold all of those needs in the time being, but I'm hearing that it didn't do it for you. I'm learning from all that there definitely are people who still practice the pledge and feel strongly about it (as opposed to people who still try to avoid tables but never encourage others to take the pledge, for example) and that leads me to think it probably does make more sense to hold the three part format mostly intact while making changes to the framing in other parts of the website.I'd like to understand your perspective more, and I'm willing to keep going back and forth on the comments if you prefer, but I'm thinking it might be most productive to have a call if you're willing.

"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","Yes, I agree that's the best outcome. My criticism is mostly a matter of framing- I think the conversations aresomuch more important that they should be the emphasis, and that when we do have the conversations, listening and emphasizing where we *are* flexible (I'll cook, we'll go for a walk instead, we'll have a vegan thanksgiving on Wednesday and I'll go somewhere else on Thursday, what sounds good to you?) as opposed to where we are not (I won't sit at the table while you're eating animals) will lead to more connection. The area where my model diverts from the original Pledge is that I think we should recognize the power of someone getting solidarity-veganism from individuals in order to attend a large event where animals are being served. In these cases, I think the table is quite arbitrary. For example, does it really count as taking the Pledge if people are snacking on hors d'vours and not sitting around a table? Am I ""breaking"" the Pledge if I stand far away from the table where animals' bodies are offered? What if I chat with someone who was still chewing something when they approached me, and I don't know on what (or who)? What if I arrive to the event after the food is gone, but no one knows why? The original Pledge doesn't require we make any requests in such a situation, and it can be so tempting not to. Or, once I went to a wedding where my partner and I had our own table, and virtually no one knew why. (Certainly no one learned about the Pledge from this outcome) We were more comfortable because animals being eaten weren't visible to us, but I don't think it did much work to stigmatize the practice. Of course, we're allowed to make decisions for our own comfort, but that's not what the Pledge is for.

"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","Hi Mark. It makes sense to have objections given the way you're seeing it- that another group is deciding to water down the Pledge. I don't want that either. The mismatch I'm seeing is that I actually think these changes strengthen the Pledge.

And I'll paste from my most recent comment to explain the thinking that the new pledge is stronger than the old one.

"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","Hi Eva. My objections to the change remain. While I do agree that more of an emphasis can be on the framing, a version of this can be added without taking anything else away (as I certainly do not agree with some of the framing you have detailed). You say to ""focus on the connection, not the strategy"". Why can’t we do both? We can indeed ""focus on the connection, AND the strategy"". You make so many assumptions that do not apply to everyone. You state it has “greatly backfired” and is “a bit of a disaster” before proclaiming to outline “what the movement learned” from this. Who is the movement? You? Did you consult “the movement” to gain consensus on these learnings? I know many who are advocates of the Pledge in its current form, who are angry and upset with your proposal. There are many statements and comments you make that disturb me but I don’t see any benefit in going through them in detail. Like I said originally, if, as an organisation, you don't want to honour the principles of the pledge in its original form then why not hand it over to someone that will? Your blog spends so much time advocating for mutual respect and not imposing your view/beliefs on someone else and then you propose doing this! It’s such a contradiction.","text",55

"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","Hi Mark, I replied to the objection about process on Facebook, where more people can join in the discussion, and I'll respond to the why-not-both and hypocrisy comments here. Strategy might have been a poor word choice, given its distinct meaning in social activism. In Nonviolent Communication, strategy refers to the thing we're asking for, which is how I meant it- the vegan table, the skipped Christmas dinner, the walk instead of lunch. Any of those would be acceptable to a Pledge taker, right? So in saying I want to focus on the connection rather than the strategy, I mean that I want to emphasize that we approach conversations in a compassionate way that cares for the connection while emphasizing some flexibility on the strategy (which Pledge takers already have, right? we're willing to skip dinner or go- if it's vegan). The alternative to this- focusing on the strategy- would be a conversation that emphasizes a demand for the vegan table so that we can act in our own integrity. I think I'm hearing that you find this objectionable also, but aren't interested in elaborating- am I getting that right? If you change your mind, I'd like to hear whether or why the dialogue-forward approach feels out of integrity with the Pledge (or is it soley the de-emphasis on vegan tables you're objecting to?) I'm also curious about your view of the edge cases I described before, and how they fit in to your understanding of the Pledge. I'm asking these questions because I suspect we're not in as much disagreement as you might think and I'm trying to figure out where our points of agreement and disagreement are. On the final point, I want to clarify that I'm not saying we shouldn't impose our views on other people. Killing animals is violent and wrong and we should do whatever we can to stop it. I'm arguing that the Pledge, as often practiced and as framed in the legacy Pledge site, isn't working like we hoped it would.","text",58

"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","I completely disagree with the way that Pax Fauna is handling this. It strikes me as extremely arrogant to  completely change a pledge that many people have taken and adhered to for years. Everyone who chose to take the Liberation pledge did so voluntarily because they agreed with its principles as originally stated. If they didn't agree, found it to be ineffective or thought they had something better they weren't in any way required to continue with it. If you feel you can create something better please introduce a different pledge so people can choose it if and only if they think it is an improvement. Imposing changes to a pledge that has existed as is for many years shows complete disrespect to all who have taken the pledge and done whatever was necessary to stay true to it.","text",62

"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","I want to acknowledge that several people have expressed unhappiness with the proposed changes. I hear a strong commitment to the original model, and deep frustration that changes have been proposed without consultation. Change can be so hard, especially when it is unexpected or if it doesn't feel like one's experiences are being honored in the process. From my perspective, I see a lot of value in the new framing. I did the Pledge for several years. In the process, some relationships were irreparably broken. I think that's not because I have a need to honor animals, but because of the way I approached the conversation. I was so triggered about the harms my loved ones were participating in, that I couldn't see or hear their perspectives. I didn't value the relationships as much as I valued the needs of other animals. And this was felt. Most of my friends, family, or coworkers were not able to see the animals' needs or experiences--until I got more vulnerable with them. Even then, some were unwilling to go there. They couldn't get passed what they perceived as self-righteousness, judgment, and selfishness from me. I believe this has left some feeling more entrenched in their positions. I believe this is a net loss for everyone and a missed opportunity. I am curious to hear how the original form of the Pledge is working for your and others in your lives. Have you observed any transformative (internal) change in your friends or family? If so, could you imagine this kind of shift with the proposed reframe?","text",68

"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","I have read both blog posts (was there supposed to be three?) and written down my thoughts as I’ve gone along. Fundamentally I completely agree with the theory of non-violence as a social movement strategy that seems to underpin this revision of the pledge. On the whole I think I actually generally agree with what you’re trying to do here which is essentially, if I’ve got this right, to show your loved ones it is personal, in a non-violent manner. This is really the conclusion I’ve come to myself as to how I approach it, even though, as you’ll see, for me the political and the personal are hard to separate. I do have a few disagreements though which I’ve put below. I really respect that your reconsidering of the pledge comes from a place of concern for activists’ mental health and of course of a desire to be more effective in our activism for the benefit of our fellow non-human animals. There should always be room to think of how our activism can be improved. So here goes…I would agree with the ‘flaws’ pointed out around the pledge’s inception, if these were true, but for me the pledge was never about utilising social networks and relationships in the way described. I understood if that idea was that if all vegans took the pledge, this would unify us as a group who’d taken a stand, in order to put pressure on the non-vegans. This was the social movement element. It was not designed to create a forced entry point in to veganism at the individual level. That is not to say that family and social groups were not disrupted at an individual level, and yes, it was a hard thing to take on. But something I’m sure most pledge takers would figure out for themselves.","text",71
"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","I myself took on pledge for what I saw as its conceptual and tactical value, more so than for the fact that I felt uncomfortable being around dead bodies - at some level I was uncomfortable but it was tolerable (such is the depth of my desensitisation at this level, even after 14 years I do not consistently find the presence of flesh unbearable and I’m aware this may shock some people) and so I grappled a long time with how to frame it, and indeed how to enact it. The idea of  the pledge did fuel anger in me","text",72
"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","Just as we didn’t necessarily expect people to go vegan because of our pledge, we never expected large scale events or settings to cater for us; we were willing to avoid them. That said, I remain hopeful that in less personal settings such as the workplace, for example, after the recent acceptance in Uk law of veganism as a belief system which can’t be discriminated against, UK dwellers we may start to feel confident in making demands for no meat at work events, for example. We also don’t need a fork round our wrist to do this either, although doing so could help galvanise the move. For me, the pledge is and has remained political for these reasons. Of course, to maintain any moral congruity, I can’t demand that people don’t eat flesh around me at work when I don’t make the same demands at home, or vice-versa and so the political and the social are inevitably entangled. In terms of not including our loved ones in the decision- I ask that, whether it’s discussed first or not, how can someone really feel included in a decision I’ve made, that they don’t like. It will always be seen as a selfish rejection. On the other hand my closest friends who support my pledge were not included on the decision either, and they are not offended by my choices. It certainly made me feel closer to these people but I question where the evidence is that such cases are in the minority. If it comes from an analysis of the comments on the Facebook support group then I would argue that people such as myself only come on there to moan about the difficulties, not the successes. Certainly I can relate to the feeling of sadness that come with the questions about ‘who loves the other less’ but as I said above, I don’t think this can be avoided. Pledge takers and their supporters understand that vegans will have previously put their own needs before others by sitting round a table in order to ‘keep the peace’.","text",73
"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","I wholeheartedly agree with the principles of non violence and that it is crucial for socialchange. I don’t agree that we can’t express our upset to someone who refuses to accept our boundaries. This is not healthy and I can’t think of another example where this should be encouraged.","text",74
"https://paxfauna.org/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge/","The whole part in blog 2 about picking who we try and connect with on this matter will cause more confusion and hurt . Whilst I completely understand the point being made here, unfortunately I feel a close family member may struggle to understand why you ask them to accommodate you, when you don’t ask ‘less important’ people, particularly less emotionally important people, to do the same. They may understand you not feeling you can ask at work (although ironically as I’ve said above, I actually feel that from a political and non emotional perspective, this is the perfect place to ask, certainly in the UK) But to give an example, when I explained to my step daughter that I would not make an exception on the pledge for her wedding, her response was that she fully expected that I would have done so for my son, had he asked (she was wrong) so why couldn’t I for her? You can imagine her hurt if I made an exception for an acquaintance I didn’t know well. This kind of inconsistency creates another version of the ‘who loves who more than who’ heartbreak. Even if we explained to people why it was more important to target those closest to us, and they understood it, the moral consistency remains undermined, and doesn’t work for those who in any case find the presence of dead flesh intolerable. Fundamentally it seems to me that this is about getting those that care about you to understand what veganism and the pledge means to you and to not eat flesh in your presence. This means you can still attend events but avoid individuals eating flesh as much as possible. This does seem a workable solution for me personally and seems much easier than not attending at all. Actually this was how I imagined my first post-pledge Xmas with my family - if it was a buffet I could dodge those with their mouth full. Had I been more secure in this approach, without going in to detail it may have been more successful than the disaster it turned out to be.","text",75

I'm considering taking the Pledge, so, I googled it, and I arrived till this page.Is the Pledge necessarily linked to any organisation that can reframe it anytime, or, Eva, your proposal is just that, a proposal that needs to be considered and accepted by the community of ""pledgers""? Also, I would love to hear from people that took it. From their personal experiences and to know what impact they think the Pledge has on the normalisation of carnism. As I see it right now the Pledge has the potential to be a force towards the de-normalisation of carnism. I imagine it could help lead us to a world where veganism is the moral baseline. I'd like to know if for most of the people that took the Pledge, it is, effectively, this driving force, or maybe even the opposite. I just requested joining the FB support group.

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","Framing the Food System: a Review for Animal Advocates of FrameWorks Institute’s Foundational Study The Frameworks Institute is a nonprofit research organization specializing in political messaging to help “mission-driven organizations build public will for progressive change.” Their methods are based on insights from psychology and cognitive sciences. In 2006, FrameWorks published their findings from a multi-staged investigation into the challenges of communicating for food system change and how to overcome them. FrameWorks’ goal was to identify frames and messages which could generate support for public policy interventions or other system-level interventions into food production industries. While the report was not concerned with animal suffering or even animal agriculture in particular, many of its insights into how the public relates to food are directly relevant for animal advocates wishing to see a change in the food system. This report summarizes the conclusions relevant to farmed animal advocates from each section of FrameWorks’ report. Just the Headlines, Please Across several diverse research methods, certain trends consistently emerged. The most important recurring themes animal advocates should take from FrameWorks’ report are: Section 1: Meta-Analysis of Prior Research The first section of FrameWorks’ report is a review and interpretation of relevant public opinion research which existed at the time. Most items in FrameWorks’ sample were published between 1999 and 2005. Here are the findings most relevant to animal advocates. Notably, many of their conclusions are similar to codes that emerged from our own sample, suggesting some aspects of public opinion around food have remained stable over the last two decades. On the other hand, some insights which would be relevant have been supplanted by more recent research, suggesting changes over time (e.g. a significant increase in awareness of antibiotic overuse on factory farms).","text",1

When forced to choose whether food manufacturers or consumers are responsible, the public overwhelming sides with consumer choice. Only 14% think “food manufacturers should be required by law to reduce serving sizes and fat and sugar content to make their products healthier,” while 83% say “it is up to individual consumers to choose healthy food products.” 81% agree “I would be willing to pay more for food grown on farms using good environmental practices.” 71% agree “I would be willing to pay more for food if it meant that it could be produced in ways that protect the environment.” 60% agree “I would be willing to pay more for food produced without using chemicals.” Fewer are willing to pay more for the humane treatment of animals. A slim majority (51%) report that they are willing to spend more for humanely-produced food. Overall, the meta-analysis paints a picture of a public that knew very little about the food system beyond the grocery store, but generally trusted that what was going on behind the scenes was acceptable. The public supported various actors in the food industry and desired to reward them with continued subsidies. There was little urgency for change, and limited imagination of what change might look like.","text",3

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","FrameWorks followed their meta-analysis with an initial round of qualitative investigation: a series of recorded interviews with a diverse sample (n=30) using open-ended questions to draw out the mental models ordinary people used to engage with the food system. These interviews revealed the dominant frames through which Americans viewed the food system. Two frames are particularly crucial for understanding public perception of food issues circa 2005: theconsumerframe and themodernizationframe. We believe both of these frames continue to saturate Americans’ thinking about food today. The Consumer Frame First and foremost, Americans conceptualize food through aconsumerframe. This frame is based on imagery and metaphors from their “lived experience of eating, shopping, cooking, being served, and so forth,” and is tied to strong values of personal choice, freedom, and autonomy. On a deeper level, this frame represents a model ofreceivingfoodpassively, and generates cynicism and hopelessness about the possibility of change, which in turn creates a powerful emotional pressure to ignore problems with the food system. In fact, the consumer frame acts to conceal the existence of a food system beyond the points of sale consumers are familiar with. To emphasize the importance of this frame, the authors contrast it with Americans’ understanding of the healthcare system. Americans frequently encounter news coverage of systematic problems with healthcare and are somewhat familiar with the different actors involved (such as pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies, hospitals, and government regulators). The public is used to thinking about healthcare as a system; the opposite is true of food. Because Americans have so much direct experience with food, they are left without any feeling that there is more to know.","text",5

Thus there is no room in their mental model for new information about other parts of the supply chain. One exchange illustrates how difficult it is for consumers to picture anything beyond the supermarket:","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","A: Fish? Where does it come from? Well, it comes from the ocean. Q: Sure. But so how does it get here? A: Oh um, I never really thought of that. I guess they fish for it. Q: OK. Who do you picture fishing? A: I don’t know, kind of I guess just fishermen. I don’t know exactly. Q: What’s the picture in your head if there is one? A: Well when I do buy fish, I normally buy it at a Chinese market. It’s like an indoor market. It’s a supermarket or like a grocery store. But it’s just for Chinese food... and if I’m going to buy shrimp or fish or anything I’ll buy it there. Because it’s fresh. Because of this difficulty, information presented by advocates tends to be subverted into their existing model which is centered on the consumer experience. Given information about systemic issues such as food safety risks, environmental consequences of agricultural practices, etc., it is difficult for people to imagine any response other than individuals changing their choices at the point of sale. Consistent with the findings of the meta-analysis, the public places responsibility on consumers for making good choices, even if they acknowledge they themselves are not making good choices. This shows how important the values ofagencyandautonomyare in the consumer frame. At the same time, on a more subconscious level, the consumer frame operates with a hierarchical model that analogizes the relationship between a provider and buyer to that between a parent and child, with the buyer passively receiving the products of the seller. This further limits the scope of action to choosing between existing products. It also creates anurturancedynamic between providers (restaurants and grocery stores) and consumers, where consumers feel indebted to providers such that objecting to the practices of providers seems disloyal.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","FrameWorks identifies several other beliefs which mediate between the consumer frame and inaction, including: On the whole, when people aren’t dismissive of the need for change, the limitations of the consumer frame render them cynical about the possibility of change. People do not have faith in other consumers to make “responsible choices,” and sometimes this leads them to feel absolved of the responsibility to choose different products as well. Finally, the sense that change is impossible creates a strong desire to ignore the issues. That desire is reinforced by people’s warm emotional attachment to their experiences of food, which they worry could be corrupted by a closer examination of the food system. This pattern of denial plays out on both a conscious and unconscious level.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","The consumer frame is a veritable minefield for food system advocates of any kind. Because of its dominant role in Americans’ relationship to food and its diverse manifestations, there are countless ways that advocates could accidentally trigger it. Any advocates seeking to build support for food system change must craft a narrative that does not inadvertently trigger the consumer frame and which overcomes the narrow, passive, cynical viewpoint it engenders. The Modernization Frame These interviews revealed that while Americans largely picture a fantasy food system putting food on grocery store shelves, they are not totally unaware that it is a fantasy. In fact, when pressed to do so, consumers can make reasonably accurate guesses about how the food system really works, based on a combination of images they’ve seen from advocates as well as inferences about how other modern industries work. According to the researchers, “people are essentiallymaking this account up as they go along– they have no established understanding that they can easily call to mind, and instead they must scratch their heads and imagine what the “real story is, or must be.” At this point, a second, equally counterproductive frame tends to come to the foreground:modernization. When the modernization frame kicks in and temporarily inhibits the consumer frame, people jump from a passive, idyllic view of the food system straight to a dystopian exaggeration of reality. This caricature is so extreme that information from advocates may seem like good news by comparison. Consider these hyperbolic descriptions: The third quote in particular highlights the observation from the meta-analysis that people don’t extend the label “farmer” to large industrial farms. Perhaps more importantly, the modernization frame fills people with a sense ofinevitabilityabout the changes our food system has undergone and leads them to describe critiques of that system as naïve.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","Modernization and industrialization are seen as superhuman forces taking a predetermined course that cannot be altered by humans. Questioning the highly industrialized food system is seen as tantamount to calling for giving up the conveniences of modern life and returning to an agrarian way of life, something interviewees roundly rejected. Instead, further modernization is seen as the only solution, whereby science would find high-tech ways to address issues.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","In fact, interviews revealed an interesting nuance of the public’s distinction between small family farms (SFFs) and large industrial farms (LIFs). While the public favors SFFs, most people don’t see them as serious economic actors capable of feeding the nation. Instead, through themodernizationframe, they assume that LIFs are more efficient and that they are the only way to produce enough food for the modern world. Advocate messages which are seen as calling for a return to an older way of doing things are likely to be rejected by a majority of the public as naïve. In order to overcome themodernizationframe, advocates should take care to describe their proposals in forward- or future-oriented language, as “the next-generation food system.” These interviews suggest that while people are cautious about technologies like GMOs, there could be some role for technology to play in making advocate proposals seem progressive and optimistic, rather than reactionary or unrealistic. Advocates should also be cautious of playing into the public’s exaggerated vision of mechanized food production, as this could make the truth seem less upsetting than it would be otherwise. We are left wondering whether an effective animal advocacy narrative would include a detailed description of an alternative food system (which might convince listeners that our proposal is not naive), or whether such a description would merely confuse the public further given their lack of knowledge about the existing system. Other Takeaways The nature of subsidies is not understood:The interviews brought further clarity to the support for subsidies revealed in the meta-analysis. Participants did not see subsidies as a government policy that shapes what food is produced and how, but rather as a benefit program to help struggling small farmers stay in business for just one more year.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","If advocates wish to address subsidies, they should be sure to first explain how subsidies are an instrument the government uses to promote certain practices and discourage others, therefore making subsidies causally responsible for specific harmful trends.","text",12
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","Intermittent exposure is counterproductive:When issues about the food system do manage to break into the headlines, they don’t stay there for long. Combined with the way the media covers these stories, this intermittent exposure leads people to see these as isolated episodes. Specifically, people assume that when the issue fades out of the news, it is because the problem has been dealt with. As one participant said: “When something seems to disappear from the news, it’s usually because it’s gotten better.” Attempts by animal advocates to break into the news cycle with specific instances of animal cruelty may therefore be quite counterproductive, creating a narrative in the public thatwhile animal cruelty sometimes happens on farms, the systems in place are able to deal with these isolated incidents appropriately.Animal welfare investigators could be seen as part of the system, creating a pattern that absolves the public of any responsibility or need for change: advocates uncover abuse, the media covers those abuses, and the government intervenes to enforce appropriate laws. This suggests that, as far as public opinion is concerned, animal advocates may want to avoid targeting specific farms or companies with investigations uncovering specific acts of cruelty and instead focus on common practices which the industry itself admits to. Advocates should focus on strategies to create sustained media attention on systemic factors of animal agriculture, rather than creating intermittent coverage of discrete acts of cruelty. Choosing to forget:Advocates should not underestimate the public’s ability to forget, sometimes willfully, facts that they have learned about where their food comes from. The scale of the problem is completely overwhelming when viewed through the consumer frame. If there are problems with a particular product, consumers can avoid that product for a time until the problems fade from their memory.","text",13
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","But if the problem is with the entire industry, they have nowhere else to turn. Consider these statements by interviewees:","text",14
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","I do trust [the food supply]. Because obviously I don’t have anywhere else to buy it. Where else am I going to get it from? We know to go to the grocery store to get whatever we need. So you sort of have to trust it. You don’t have a choice. Lately I’ve been kind of disgusted, because PETA sent me some disgusting flyers, just gross. A whole package of stuff that I wish I hadn’t looked at. But I still eat steak… now I actually think about how it got there, you know, when I’m looking at it in the grocery store before I buy it, I’m thinking what happened to it before it came ... It’s been about a month since I got that, so it’s fading, the memory of the pictures is fading. … it never occurred to me until it was pointed out so blatantly. But I’ll think about it rarely. It’s the kind of thing I don’t want to think about while I’m eating. The researchers list a number of beliefs that work together to suppress public concern about food issues: Together, these observations underline the need to offer the public a means of integrating information about the food system other than consumer change. We hypothesize that, if the public could be given an alternate course of action such as supporting a specific law or ballot initiative to make drastic changes to the food system, they would be better able to take in and organize information about the problems with the system currently. Section 3: Analysis of Newspaper Representations Next, FrameWorks examined the narratives used by the newspapers and by those advocating changes to the food system. Unsurprisingly, in their attempts to create interesting, readable stories, journalists did little to help the public form a coherent understanding of the food system. Some of the media narratives FrameWorks documented in 2005 will be familiar to animal advocates, and several remain relevant to this day.","text",15
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","While most animal advocates are already aware of the need to avoid presenting themselves as adversaries of small farmers, FrameWorks’ media analysis underlines this need. SFFs are an idealized category, frequently spoken of in terms of their unique ability to embody America’s history and values. The challenge for animal advocates is to present a compelling, memorable, and understandable story about the connections between food consumption, food production, and government policy. For this narrative to translate into the media, it must leave room for individual stories that reinforce, rather than undermine, a coherent picture of the whole. Most importantly, this narrative must explain the central role of actors other than consumers in shaping the food system. These findings suggest that if such a narrative were presented, at least a portion of the media would adopt it.","text",16
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","Section 4: Analysis of Advocacy Paradigms FrameWorks’ review of messages put out by food system advocates reached a sobering conclusion: “Americans have no working conceptual model of the food system as a whole, and advocates are not helping them acquire one.” Of course, advocates consistently offer explanations of various important problems related to food – the harmful effects of pesticides, the low wages paid to agricultural workers here and abroad, the disregard of large food distribution companies for dietary health, and for the needs of people in particular neighborhoods, and so forth. But the key ideas around which advocates’ thinking and communications are organized often work against, rather than for, the crystallization of aFood Systemas a coherent concept. The authors criticized advocates for focusing on discrete issues (e.g. fair wages, environmental impact, food health, and scarcity) in a way that made it more difficult for the public to make connections between these issues, and to connect it all to their personal experience of food. Crucially, the solution is not merely to list all these issues together. Particularly striking is the frequency with which advocates use terms that FrameWorks’ interviews had shown have no meaning for the general public, such asfood security, sustainability, social justice,andslow, local,ororganic food. Advocates regularly made appeals to such concepts without offering any explanation of their meaning, suggesting they do not realize how little these words mean to average people. Instead, advocates need to offer a unified conceptual model of the food system which can help the public make connections between these different issues. Such a model should use plain language and clearly define new concepts when they must be introduced. The current research asks whether much of the vocabulary currently used by animal advocates is similarly meaningless to the general public.","text",17
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","If so, our messages could be further obfuscating the nature of the system we are trying to target. Other reports in this series show the public does not have a shared understanding of the meaning of “cage-free” eggs. Seeing advocate materials promoting cage-free eggs or announcements about a retailer switching to cage-free eggs may serve to deepen the public’s misunderstandings of animal agriculture. Likewise, advocate materials that merely name issues likepublic health, environment,andworkers' rightsmay only sow confusion (in addition to provoking a backlash, as discussed below).","text",18
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","Section 5: Focus Groups The second and more substantial phase of qualitative research involved twelve focus groups in which FrameWorks explored several possible ways of reframing the food system to create a coherent, unified model. In all but the first two focus groups, participants were first asked to read one of a series of fictional news articles incorporating different framing approaches. For the most part, responses to these articles revealed the same patterns discussed in the earlier phase involving one-on-one interviews. Researchers identified several factors that would determine whether a narrative could successfully shift the conversation to more productive frames. The following are relevant for animal advocates: Section 6: Developing a Simplifying Model At this stage, FrameWorks developed and testedsimplifying modelsto help laypeople form a  coherent understanding of the food system. These models had three components: ageneral propositionproblematizing the food system, ametaphorto organize that proposition, and one or morereal-world examplesto cement the connection between the metaphor and reality. Researchers developed roughly 40 candidate models using this template and tested them with interviews and questionnaires using 650 participants. The model ultimately recommended in the report turns out to be one of the only candidates at all relevant to animal advocates: therunaway food system. In recommending this model, FrameWorks focused on several key qualities: “The recommended model… succeeded in helping people focus on the Big Picture, acknowledge that there are real problems, and that these can and must be addressed.” Therunaway food systemmodel analogizes the food system to a runaway train or truck.","text",19
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","It begins with a core proposition that focuses on the methods of producing food rather than the experience of consumers; contains a clear causal link between an out-of-control process and harm; and implicitly calls for system-level intervention: Our methods of producing food have become so powerful, and are so uncontrolled, that they are threatening the basic systems that are vital to our wellbeing.","text",20
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","This core proposition is anchored in therunaway trainmetaphor, creating a clear image of a coherent force that will cause harm and destruction if it is not brought under control. This metaphor can then support a broad range of real, specific examples from the food industry. During this phase of research, participants were presented with the following paragraph: Experts are increasingly concerned about what they call our Runaway Food System. The way we produce food today has radically changed, and now has the power to alter the foundations of life as we know it almost by accident. Farming chemicals like pesticides and weed-killer are permanently altering our soil and water. Genetic engineering is changing the nature of the plants and animals we eat. And mile-long fishing nets are dragging the ocean floor and altering ecosystems. America needs to retake control of this runaway food system before it does more damage to the foundations we depend on. Their responses bear almost no resemblance to the way people talked about food in earlier phases of qualitative research. With no further prompting, subjects called for the government to step in and bring food production under control: “Something radical needs to be done” in the form of “better regulation.” Interestingly, while earlier phases of research concluded that talking about health was the most effective way to pique the public’s interest, including health as a concern made messages in therunaway food systemmodel less effective at focusing the conversation on policy. This likely speaks to the efficacy of the simplifying model for leading people to a systemic view; including health language was unnecessary to gather interest, and merely reactivated a consumer viewpoint. Can therunaway food systemmetaphor be useful to animal advocates? The current research will certainly consider that question; we suspect the answer is yes.","text",21
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","While the runaway metaphor is designed to connect current farming practices to future harms, it was more effective than any other model at conveying the need to manage the system. We already know that, when confronted with information about the suffering of animals, one of the most common responses from the public is helplessness, just as was the reaction to other issues studied by FrameWorks. Below, we find that most people express disgust about the conditions of animals in modern agriculture, and suggest that if they could design the food system themselves, they would create something much different. Therunaway food systemmodel can help the public think about food production as something that ought to be firmly under control, but has escaped that control, and can be reigned in through government interventions they otherwise would not consider.","text",22
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","Section 7: Testing the Model in a National Survey Finally, FrameWorks conducted a national priming survey to quantitatively establish the efficacy of therunawaymodel. 3,294 participants were randomly assigned to answer a series of questions designed to introduce one of three frames:legacy, protection,andreciprocity,plus a control. Then half the respondents were randomly exposed to therunaway food systemparagraph quoted above, for a total of 8 possible primings (including control). After exposure, respondents were asked about their level of concern about different problems in the food system, as well as their support for various policies. Across the questions studied, the most effective priming was therunaway food systemparagraph combined with thelegacyframe. Interestingly, neither of these primings was very effective on its own, but together, they had a significant favorable impact across all demographics. Thelegacyframe appealed to the value of leaving a positive legacy for future generations, or ‘leaving the world better than we found it.’ By focusing on the future, thelegacyframe was key to inhibiting the negative effects of themodernizationframe. It also promoted big-picture thinking by asking participants to imagine a time after they are gone, when their individual lived experiences as consumers would no longer be relevant. This futuristic orientation was the main difference between thelegacyandprotectionframes and is the simplest explanation of whylegacyoutperformed. Conclusion Taken as a whole, FrameWorks’ report highlights the importance for advocates to help the public think of the food system as a whole, an entity shaped by government and corporate policy. It also demonstrates compelling evidence that strategic reframing enables advocates to help the public build a coherent mental model of the food system.","text",23
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/framing-the-food-system-a-review-for-animal-advocates-of-frameworks-institutes-foundational-study/","Particularly, a narrative using therunaway food systemmetaphor and emphasizing the importance oflegacyimmediately increased public understanding and support for advocates’ goals. Interestingly, despite these findings, we have been unable to identify any instance of an advocacy organization adopting the explanatory metaphor of arunaway food system.","text",24

If you missed them, here are previous blogs in this series. Part One:why we study nonviolence Part Two: thepractice of empathy Part Three: the building blocks of empathy,feelings and needs Part Four:observations and requests Part Five:beginning a practice in NVC Part Six:when enemies appear Part Seven:the movement needs a repair kit The Gist: Before I got involved in activism, I worked in healthcare. Fresh out of college, I held my idea ofprofessionalismtightly and revealed little about myself to colleagues, keeping my exchanges sunny and brief. It was easy to do because my role involved driving by myself to patients’ homes for visits, so I seldom had moments for small talk with colleagues. One day, after I had been working there for about six months, my team got together for lunch to celebrate an intern’s graduation. It was at a Mediterranean place, so I easily found something to eat. After we sat down with our food, the most veteran team member, Tom, asked what I was eating, and after I told him, asked if I was vegan. I confirmed. He replied, “Hey, how do you know if someone is vegan? Oh, don’t worry, they’ll tell you!” I don’t remember what I said next. I probably just laughed, but inside I was seething. If I had had any vegan friends at the time, I would have immediately excused myself to the bathroom to text them.He asked! How does he get to make that joke when he was the one who brought it up! Here are some things I know about the interaction that day. I imagine many readers can relate to this, and especially can understand the impact of that final point above. What made the joke even worse was that I had receivedmanysimilar cues of nonbelonging before. I’m thinking of times when, given limited options, I put together a strange combination of foods and someone said it looked gross.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/what-anti-vegan-bias-can-teach-us-about-allyship/","I’m remembering times someone told me, “I could never be vegan, I just love…” and described the experience of eating an animal’s body in graphic detail. Or a high-school friend who made a habit of telling me, “I like the kind of vegan you are because you don’t make a big deal about it.”","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/what-anti-vegan-bias-can-teach-us-about-allyship/","This is something that Tom had no idea about: he wasn’t there for any of those moments. Even so, his intention was completely unrelated to the impact his words had. Years later In January 2020 I attended a Nonviolent Communication retreat with my colleague Aidan. After a session on microaggressions by renowned trainer Roxy Manning, Aidan said to me, “Vegans can definitely experience microaggressions.” I cringed, feeling a million retorts compete to come out of my mouth. “Are you equating being vegan with…” “That’s super problematic.” “We choose veganism; nobody chooses their race, gender, sexuality, age, ability, etc.” “Gosh, I hope you never bring this up again.” But in the magical, open, listen-first air of the retreat, I saved my retorts. I found space to listen to what he meant before I responded. As it turned out, Roxy taught this definition of microaggressions: Things we say or do, or structures we create, that intentionally or unintentionally send a message to a particular group that they do not belong or are less than. While not explicit above, the explanation Roxy gives in her book,The Anti-Racist Heart, requires an element of systemic power. “Because microaggressions are rooted in beliefs that some groups are less than others, a critical understanding of microaggressions include that they target groups that have been historically marginalized and given less structural power in society.” So,microaggressionwouldn’t usually refer to a joke at the expense of the only white person in the room or a comment disparaging Christmas in the US. Rather, it refers to a black person being calledarticulateor women in pain beingdenied medication, as brief examples. The concept was coined to describe subtle acts of racism and has expanded to refer to things that reinforce other differences in societal privilege, like gender, ability, class, religion, and nationality.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/what-anti-vegan-bias-can-teach-us-about-allyship/","Roxy describesreceiversof microaggressions, who directly experience the cues of nonbelonging based on their own social identity, and alsobystanders, who can be impacted greatly despite not being the direct object of the microaggression.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/what-anti-vegan-bias-can-teach-us-about-allyship/","It’s true that veganism is a choice in a way that many social identities are not. It’s also true that when we open ourselves up to feeling empathy for animals, we feel that pain very deeply as bystanders. And, while animals themselves are victims of systemic violence, their advocates arepenalizedfor bringing attention to this, even with the subtlety of what we eat. But that realization—that microaggressions are experienced by animal advocates—isn’t about giving us a free pass. It’s about recognizing the way microaggressions can isolate and harm, even while being completely invisible to the person creating them. I offer this in hopes that we can feel more committed to avoiding them, to repairing any harm that we inadvertently cause, and to communicating in ways that help each member of our communities feel that theydobelong. We Are Tom, Too I really liked my colleague, Tom, as did everyone else. He’s a goofy, sensitive guy with a carefree attitude I worked to emulate. (Did I tell you we were working inhospice?) Tom being one of the only men in our company, it’s likely that over the years working together, I sent him some cues that he didn’t belong there as a man. In fact, as someone who belongs to a lot of dominant cultural groups (I’m a white, cis, so-far able-bodied, straight-passing person in the US) it’s likely I’ve inadvertently sent a lot of cues of nonbelonging to a lot of people. What Does Repair Look Like? If we have a story in our heads that says that microaggressions are inflicted by racist (etc.) people, then it can be impossible to hear someone when they say that we’ve inflicted one. It conflicts with our self-image too much. Our only option might be to deny that we’ve done it. If we can understand that microaggressions happen in a context in which both the actor and receiver are only a tiny part, it’s easier to respond supportively when we find out that we’ve messed up. When Tom made the joke about preachy vegans, I never told him how it landed.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/what-anti-vegan-bias-can-teach-us-about-allyship/","This is the case with a lot—and probably the vast majority—of microaggressions we will commit in our lives. But let’s imagine a world where Tom had the opportunity to hear me out and try to repair the disconnect he had caused.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/what-anti-vegan-bias-can-teach-us-about-allyship/","I’ll go through a repair process as a dialogue, with notes in between about what is happening. I’ll include directions for both the actor and receiver (who, in this case, can also be calledbystander) and imagine that both are “wearing giraffe ears.” (Marshall Rosenberg, NVC’s founder, would sometimes use giraffe puppets to role-play characters speaking nonviolently to each other.) But please keep in mind thatneither person depends on the other following my directions.That is, in real life, we’re usually talking to people without training in this particular communication modality. Even so, this model can work for people on either side of a microaggression. Let’s imagine a private conversation after our team lunch has concluded. In this scenario, the receiver brings up the harm, as the actor was completely unaware of it. In other cases, it could also be appropriate for the actor to start the conversation with a gentle invitation to check in about anything bothering the other person or specifically about how a particular interaction landed for them. Eva: Hey Tom, there was something you said earlier that landed pretty hard for me. Are you open to talking about it? Tom is quickly doing silent self-empathy in this moment, checking in with his body sensations and trying to determine if he’s ready to have this conversation. He’s taking a deeper breath to self-regulate. Tom: Sure, what’s up? Eva’s going to try her best to use observation language, while still identifying multiple layers of the observation to help Tom understand why this is a big deal to her. She’ll refer to the joke generally to avoid disagreement about exact wording. She’ll name the feelings that came up for her and the needs that were unmet. Eva: When you made the joke about vegans telling you that they’re vegan, I felt pretty alienated.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/what-anti-vegan-bias-can-teach-us-about-allyship/","I’ve been vegan for a long time for reasons that are really important to me, and it’s almost always the case that I’m the only vegan in the group, so it can already be something that leads to me not feeling the belonging that I’d like. When I hear stuff like that, it stings because it builds on a whole bunch of similar experiences.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/what-anti-vegan-bias-can-teach-us-about-allyship/","Now, she’ll pass the conversation back to him. As an attempt to slow it down and give herself a chance to be heard before he defends himself, she’ll ask for a reflection. Eva: That might be a lot to hear—would you mind telling me what you got from that? It would really help me to know that you’re understanding it. Even if Eva didn’t make the direct request, Tom could offer a reflection to make sure he’s understanding it. He issotempted to explain that he didn’t mean anything by the joke, but he refrains, and focuses on letting her know he hears her. Tom: Okay, I think I’m getting it. It sounds like veganism, while important to you, can be pretty isolating. And comments like mine are hard to hear because they cue that you don’t belong here, either. Is that it? She might have more to say, to which Tom will continue to reflect. Once she’s been heard out, they can move on. Eva: Yeah, and I also know that experiences like this are one of the reasons that people decide to keep eating animals, or they start again after they stop, even when they care deeply about animals like I do. So when I feel that, it’s compounded because I know it’s the experience that means I have less camaraderie in this than I wish I did. Now Tom really feels like too much is being put on him. He didn’t create all of animal agriculture! He didn’t even come up with the joke himself! This is true; what Eva wants Tom to understand is not about him. Again, he refrains from defending himself, and reflects what he heard. Tom: I see, so it’s even bigger than your own history, and it feels so big because it’s the kind of thing that affects many others and stops them from joining you in veganism? Am I getting it? Eva: Yeah, that’s it. Now Tom will try to repair the relationship, first by sharing how it impacts him to hear her. He’ll start by asking if his share is welcome. Tom: I’m glad you let me know about this. Would you be open to hearing what’s coming up for me? Eva: Sure.","text",12
"https://paxfauna.org/what-anti-vegan-bias-can-teach-us-about-allyship/","He’ll be careful not to self-flagellate with overly emotional language, which can sometimes feel like a demand for comfort or reassurance. He’ll once again avoid the urge to defend himself, and instead keep a focus on his impact on her. The question of whether he did something wrong has not come up. He mourns the impact without taking blame.","text",13
"https://paxfauna.org/what-anti-vegan-bias-can-teach-us-about-allyship/","Tom: I’m sad to hear that it had that impact, and I think I get why it did. I want you to have a sense of belonging here and I definitely don’t want to be the reason that anyone feels unwelcome. How is that to hear? Eva might need more empathy at this point, or she might not. Eva: Thanks for hearing that, it helps to know that it matters to you. At this point, we can talk about solutions. Tom will name the obvious– not repeating the microaggression in the future– and probe for need for further repair. Tom: Of course I’ll do my best not to make a joke like that again after hearing the effect it has, but is there anything else I can do now to help? Observations Have Layers I’ll draw attention also to the different aspects of her experience that this fictional Eva described. In classical NVC, observations were sometimes taught as “something that can be observed with a video camera.” Roxy Manning notes how video cameras, and the attention of the people viewing videos, can pick up a million different observations depending on where they’re pointed. Roxy calls observations on this level,external. In this case, this is Tom saying “How do you know if someone is vegan? Don’t worry, they’ll tell you.” Instead of stating the observation, Eva referred to it generally, saying “When you made the joke about vegans telling you they’re vegan.” This might sometimes be smoother to share than the observation itself because we can remember exact words or events differently. Roxy also teachesinternalobservations. These are memories, internal reactions, or personal context that help all parties understand the impact of the external observation. In this case, Eva shares information about her personal history with veganism and similar jokes. Finally, we discusssystemicobservations. The impact on Eva mostly lives at this level. It’s not just that Tom made a joke at her expense, or even that it was one that she’s heard a bunch of times in her life.","text",14

The reason it sucked so much to hear that joke was that it relates to something really big- animal exploitation and Eva’s alienation in her understanding of it.","text",15

Even fictional giraffe-eared meat-eaters can shut down given too much horror. Instead, she spoke generally about animals- that there are important reasons for being vegan, and that she cares about animals—and shared a systemic observation about vegans—that their recidivism is related to their alienation. This allowed Tom to hear her and begin to understand. It also allowed Eva to practice self-respect and integrity with her own values. We Can Be Better Allies By relaying a repair that you can imagine from thereceiverorbystanderside, I hope to invite you to imagine yourself, also, on theactorside of this exchange. You may find yourself inadvertently causing harm to someone by delivering a cue of nonbelonging because of their race, sexuality, gender, ability, age, or for one of many other factors. The experience of delivering a microaggression is often that of experiencing someone else “overreacting” to something we’ve said or done, because we aren’t immediately aware of the layers of experience that are present. In these cases, your task of repair is not in defending yourself or explaining what you’ve meant—it’s in deeply understanding the other person to the extent that they want to share, and in sharing your commitment to repair and to learn for the future.

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","Developing a Messaging Strategy to End Animal Farming Using Focus Groups 1. Introduction & Key Recommendations In this study, we designed and tested new messages for animal advocates based on findings from previous research. In particular, our goal was to develop newcounter-narrativesthat have the potential to displace the dominant narratives around farming animals, which justify it. We chose to focus onnarrativein particular because narratives can deliver specific benefits. Research has shown that compared to purely informational messaging,narrative has a greater potentialto grab people’s attention, create emotional connections, and help people remember complex ideas. We used focus groups in order to mimic the way that people often process new ideas through conversations with peers, rather than in isolation. In a group setting, participants could hear each other’s arguments for and against the messages we were testing and we could see which arguments would win out in the group as a whole. Among many elements of messaging strategy, this research mainly focused on emotional register (tone), messengers, and the message itself. These are our top recommendations: 2. Primary Questions & Research Design What messaging strategies are most effective for overcoming the dominant narratives in favor of using animals for food and building support for government intervention to accelerate the transition away from animal agriculture? The two primary components of messaging strategy we focused on were thenarrativerepresented and the characteristics of themessenger,the person delivering the message. We also experimented with imagery. Using one-on-one interviews, we had previously identified several patterns in how ordinary meat-eaters relate to the issue of using animals for food. From that research stage to this one, we made two pivots. First, we switched from interviewing one participant at a time to group interviews of 2-5 strangers.","text",1
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","The primary reason for this is that people do not process social and political questions alone but as members of a group. Focus groups are thus aresearch strategy to mimic the social arenawhere animal advocates’ messages are heard and discussed.","text",2
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","The second significant change was from asking open-ended questions to testing written messages. While one-on-one advocacy is uniquely useful, a great deal of advocate messaging to the mass public is in the form of videos, ads, and other one-way communications. In this context, advocates can’t alter their message based on the audience's response; we only have one chance to get it right. Accordingly, for this research, we limited ourselves to presenting static messages and did not attempt to refute the counter-arguments of participants. What criteria did we use to assess the efficacy of each message? This had to do with our organizing the public intobase, opposition,andpersuadable middlecategories. No message will have the same effect on everyone. Simply put, we were looking for a message which could catch on among the base, overcome resistance in the persuadables, and in doing so, isolate the opposition. The base, representing the most sympathetic 20% or so of the public, are the people we hope will adopt and spread a reframing of the issue. Thus, a strong candidate narrative is one that these people can easily remember and adopt, and that inspires and motivates them. We were interested in which messages people would refer back to later in the interview or borrow language from. To be clear, we are not suggesting that 20% of people will take an active role in the animal movement; the movement should aim to convert these people intopassive supporters,who do little more than speak using the movement’s narrative. A strong narrative should also win the support of a majority of the public. Our goal for the persuadable middle is not necessarily that they will actively adopt the new narrative any time soon but that hearing it can move them closer to us. We don’t need to turn 51% of people into advocates; we just need them to vote in favor of pro-animal laws, however begrudgingly.","text",3
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","That said,we did not necessarily expect to find a narrative that could convert 50% of people to support the movement just from hearing it in one focus group. If such a strong message existed, we wouldn’t need a social movement. For instance, if someone had run a study like this ten years ago on racialized police violence, the “Black Lives Matter” narrative likely would have fallen flat. New narratives alone are sterile; their success depends on a strategy for winning narrative dominance. Thus we were mainly seeking a crack in the armor of the dominant narrative, a counter-narrative showing enough promise that itcould,with the help of a sustained social movement, catch on among the base and cause a shift in perspective among the majority.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","2.1 Methods We conducted 40 focus groups with 130 participants in total. Participants were paid $40 each for a 90-minute session. Methods were similar to the individual interviews described in theprevious report in this series, except for the differences below. We began intentionally excluding conservatives from the study. Our findings in individual interviews corroborated substantial evidence that conservatives are generally more hostile to animal freedom messaging. We expected to meet greater resistance to reframing the issue in group interviews compared to individual interviews and felt that including conservatives in the study would result in such high resistance to all messages that relatively strong messages would be difficult to notice. However, due to participants’ misreporting on the initial intake form combined with our own errors, we wound up with 13% conservative participants. After an off-topic icebreaker question, each focus group started with the interviewer presenting a stimulus. For roughly the first 20 focus groups, the stimulus was one of six variations of a fictional news article about a ballot measure introduced in either Colorado or Oregon, featuring quotes from advocates and opponents (participants were informed of the deception after the interview was over). The nature of the measure varied, from banning slaughterhouses or the sale of meat to subsidizing meat alternatives. Participants read the stimulus out loud before discussing their reactions. In the latter 20 groups, we replaced the long-form news article with a sequence of short stimuli formatted as social media ads such as the image below. First, participants were told about the fictional ballot initiative. Then they read and reacted to one quote at a time. This change was meant to further simulate the way most people will interact with advocate messaging in the real world (e.g. via social media ads).","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","A mix of real and fictional messengers were paired with fictional quotes that continued to develop based on feedback from focus groups. (To be completely clear, we are not recommending advocates fabricate quotes, but use these recommendations to inform what they themselves say.)","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","Interviewers limited their questions to simply repeating quotes from the stimuli, along with a few other pre-scripted questions. All scripts and stimuli are available in thematerials. The image below is an example of a social media ad-style stimulus. These images typically featured fictional names alongside stock photos or photos of our associates, though some used recognizable celebrities. In all cases, the messages were designed by our research team. The image was meant to mimic one that might be seen during a real ballot measure campaign, thus a “paid for” statement and a number for the measure were included. The format and colors were identical for all images; only the photograph, quote, and description of the messenger changed.","text",7

Elements of Messaging Over the course of this study, we tested the potential of dozens of new narratives to build support for the animal movement. We also looked for lessons in how those narratives could be effectively packaged and presented: for instance, the emotional tone of the message, or the messenger delivering it. We’ll discuss those lessons first because they informed the design of the candidate narratives discussed towards the end of this report. 3.1 Latent Public Support is Widespread but Shallow We entered this stage of the research feeling optimistic. Our individual interviews had found promising results. We were also still thinking about survey findings such as those by Sentience Institute and Oklahoma State University suggesting that as much as 48% of the American public (and even more so among liberals) would support a ban on slaughterhouses. In our earliest focus groups, we paired the highest-performing language from the individual interviews with a fictional ballot measure that would ban slaughterhouses in Colorado in 6 years. The response foreshadowed patterns of unexpectedly strong opposition that would persist through the rest of the study. “Reduce It, Don’t Ban It” For most of our participants, meat is seen as problematic, but not inherently wrong. They are aware of and at least passively concerned with the harms caused by meat production, but very few people think they warrant abolishing animal agriculture. Instead, they feel that the problems can be addressed by reducing meat consumption or reforming the industry. The kinds of objections people made to a real and specific policy measure differed somewhat from the more general pro-meat rationalizations we had encountered in individual interviews. Futility, culture, and naturalness were less common. The most common were: The topic of using animals for food appears to bring out libertarian instincts among even dyed-in-the-cotton Liberals.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","Objections to a ban often centered around values offree choice, and participants suggested far less impactful alternatives intended to preserve choice. They often explicitly referenced themarketwhen describing their preferred solutions.Common counter-proposals involved educating the public, subsidizing meat alternatives, and taxing meat.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","I think we should definitely have a more gentle stance instead of the use of the wordban, maybe providing people motivation or incentive to try, you know, eat more plant-based products, rather than just completely ban stuff… I've wanted to like cut down on eating meat, to at least have one day a week where I don't eat meat. But I think this is really unrealistic. I mean, the way if you really wanted to get people to stop eating meat, probably the pathway to that is to subsidize cheaper alternatives, so that people will just naturally gravitate towards buying cheaper food. I also think that completely banning meat, farming and selling it is impossible. There's no way that that's ever going to happen. So I think the real solution would be to educate people, instead of restricting it at all. Because people are gonna find a way to get it anyway. If I were to go to a bunch of even liberal people today and be like, ‘let's ban meat.’ I don't know if more than 10% of them in that room agree with me… a meat tax, you might be able to get that by. But to ban it? ConflatingSlaughterhousesandFactory Farms The extremely low support we found for banning slaughterhouses led us to conclude that something is amiss with earlier surveys. One explanation is that many members of the public do not appear to differentiate betweenfactory farmsandslaughterhouses.This is an example of advocates overestimating the public’s knowledge of a topic. Many interviewees were not aware that animals are raised and slaughtered at different facilities. They lump footage they have seen of factory farms and slaughterhouses into one category: a bleak industrial facility where meat is produced. Several participants mentioned slaughter in the context offactory farmsor mentioned crowding and cages in the context ofslaughterhouses. There may be other reasons that surveys find unrealistically high support for banning slaughterhouses.","text",12
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","While we do not provide a definitive answer, we recommend advocates not rely on that survey data until further research can clarify this discrepancy.","text",13
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","The Hostility of Groups Participants in group interviews were considerably more resistant to animal advocate messages than those in individual interviews. The presence of other meat-eaters provided reminders of the dominant narrative and created social pressure to conform to it, or offered social cover to state pro-meat positions which others in the group shared but about which the individual may privately feel ambivalent. One participant asserting a dominant pro-meat narrative would often cause the other participants to become more hostile to advocate messages. In individual interviews, we had come to expect participants to be willing to show vulnerability about their conflicted feelings about meat. But when participants felt discomfort in group interviews, they often responded by bonding with other participants about negative experiences with meat alternatives, or with vegans. Such comments proved to be a sure way to get laughs from other participants. Even group size mattered. Due to no-shows, we had a number of interviews with only two participants. Participants in dyad interviews were usually more receptive than larger groups, and to a lesser extent triads were as well. This is consistent with a large body of literature in economics and psychology suggesting that individuals are less likely to make moral decisions while in groups than alone. Animal advocates should consider how to bring their message to people when they are alone, or in very small groups. For individual outreach, this lesson is simple enough. But organizations can also think about how to craft messaging strategies that reach people while they are alone. Underestimating Support Another explanation for the relative hostility of group interviews is that participants believe other people are more hostile to animal advocate messages than they themselves are.","text",14
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","This would be consistent with other research showing people’stendency to mask views they believe are politically or socially divergent while in groups, even when those views are in fact widely held. In the individual interviews, many participants expressed moderate support while believing their view was a small minority:","text",15
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","I would support it. I don't think I can imagine it because I feel like too many people like meat. But I mean, I could be wrong, you know, one day this could happen. And it would be a huge step forward and a huge benefit. I would definitely go that route… But again, this seems impossible to implement. People will fight back, as you're trying to take over their liberties, their choices to make these decisions for themselves. I would definitely be able to transition. It may be harder for other people, because they may not know what to eat, or how to make the food or what foods are out there… But for me, I'll be able to make that transition pretty well. While support for an outright ban on meat is currently low, there is widespread discomfort with meat which is not visible to most people. Because meat is so normalized, they believe their discomfort is unique or rare. To address this, advocates should find ways to make latent support for their cause more visible. 3.2 ReassessingFutilityand theEvolve TogetherFrame In individual interviews, we found thatfutilitywas the most persistent messaging obstacle for animal advocates and that the metaphor ofevolutionwas a promising way to overcome futility. We therefore used theevolve togetherframe centrally in stimuli for the focus groups. While opposition was higher in the early group interviews than it had been in the later individual interviews, futility played a much smaller role, with objections instead focusing on the affordability of animal-free foods as well as infringement on consumer choice. Evolutionmay have been partly responsible for this, though another obvious explanation is that the participants were presented with a news article about a ballot measure “designed to accelerate society’s transition away from using animals for food” and the existence of such a ballot measure made drastic change seem like a real possibility.","text",16
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","Shortly, we will discuss how the presence of a highly ambitious policy proposal made people support higher-impact proposals than they would otherwise, demonstrating theradical flank effect.Together, these findings point to the tremendous agenda-setting effect that a highly ambitious ballot measure could have on the debate about using animals for food.","text",17
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","On its own, theevolve togethermessage continued to elicit positive responses, and the language ofevolutionstuck with participants. Respondents appreciated the implication of gradual change. Along with the ballot measure, theevolve togetherframe helped interviewees understand that the ask was not for them to immediately go vegan, the demand they are used to hearing from animal advocates: I like the way that they described it as well, because they specifically called it an evolution away from meat, meaning they understand that it's going to be a process, it's going to take some time. It's not going to be an overnight, ‘Oh, well, you know, no one can eat meat anymore.’ It's just a slow process of everybody getting used to the changes and just adapting to a new style of life. I'm looking at this and I don't think it's very incendiary… I also like the wording, how it's an evolution away from meat. I really believe in us evolving away from eating so much meat even though I'm not a vegetarian, and I love beef especially and it's very painful to think about. But I really think we've got to do it… 3.3 Tone: Facts and Feelings What tone should animal advocates use when addressing the general public? When are emotional appeals effective, and when do people respond better to a more cool, rational tone? What is the role of hard facts in messaging? These questions are crucial, as the wrong tone gives people an excuse to dismiss or ignore advocate messages. Our findings on tone were complicated and somewhat contradictory. In short, most participants insisted that they prefer an emotionally neutral message focused on facts. Yet when presented with facts, the most common response was to question their credibility. Meanwhile, while overtly emotional appeals were ridiculed and dismissed as manipulative, more subtle appeals to emotion (e.g. with images) had an obviously positive effect.","text",18
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","Here, we attempt to unravel these contradictions and make suggestions for how advocates can thread the needle between facts and emotions.","text",19
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","Ambivalence Towards Factual Assertions During focus groups, we often noticed an antagonistic feeling between the participants and the messages they were being shown. One of the most common ways participants sought to poke holes in the test messages was by saying they lacked information: I think the best way to go about this would not be [to make analogies]... if they can compare [animal and plant-based meat], just side by side, and give some facts about each side and show why you know, plant-based meat can be just as natural if not more than regular meat. Although I like the idea, I think they could add more detail like how they think one is better than the other. [It needs] more facts that are going to tell me why I really should support it. I think I would lend my support towards it. But I would also just just want to know more information… there was a lack of sources, a lack of proper citations and a lack of a lot of the numbers and background information. So while I would support a measure like this, I just want to know more. ...if you're not going to cite something, don't say it. Yet when facts were presented, participants frequently responded with several ways of dismissing them. They asserted that without giving lengthy context, the facts could be misleading. They would point out the lack of a citation, even in a two-sentence quote on a social media ad. If a citation was provided, they might question the intentions of the researchers or their sponsors, or else describe feeling lost in a maze of contradictory science, especially about health topics but also more generally.","text",20
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","[Responding to a quote from a doctor] “I feel like this statement is not necessarily completely correct, I don't think it really paints the whole picture… I just feel like [he’s] a TV doctor, kind of just like, ‘I'm just paid for this to say whatever.’ I hate these types, because I feel like it's irresponsible for someone in medicine.” I'm wondering where they did that study… I think the way this is written is meant to be like a little thought piece that was just thrown out there. So somebody looks at the numbers, and then that's what sticks with them. So then if it comes up in conversation with someone later, they cite the numbers, even if they don't really know where those numbers came from. Um, and it's effective in terms of advertisement and getting your message out, but at the same time, especially because we don't know their sources or any of the background information overall. That could be potentially pretty misleading for a lot of people.","text",21
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","The thing about studies is like, one minute, something will be bad for you and cause dementia, and the next week or the next day, it's the complete opposite. So I don't really pay attention to studies anymore. One day drinking three cups of coffee is bad. And the next minute, it's like, ‘oh my gosh, you need to drink at least three cups of coffee to live until you're 70.’ So I don't really pay attention to studies like I used to. I don't like when people state things and don't mention their sources. Interviewees’ ambivalence towards factual claims suggests a deep distrust of political messages and a sense of helplessness in not knowing what to believe in a political landscape fraught with dishonesty and deception. Citations Provide Legitimacy Though imperfect, the most effective strategy we found to respond to this skepticism was including citations.On any slide that contained a factual claim, participants appreciated a link they could hypothetically follow to learn more and see the data behind the claim. Participants were not able to use these links during the interview, and we are skeptical that many of them actually would closely scrutinize this data to confirm the claim. But the mere presence of a link was reassuring and significantly reduced participants’ tendency to dismiss factual assertions. I appreciate that they put percentages and facts, if you can verify them in [the link]. Because numbers speak to me… I don't want it to just say, ‘it makes greenhouse gases,’ that doesn't mean as much to me as saying ‘it makes 37% of all greenhouse gases.’ I appreciate that.” ( I like that there's some statistics in here. And I particularly like the link where I could do more. I'm a kind of a researchaholic and I would definitely, if this was something I was interested in learning more about, I would definitely take advantage of that. So I appreciate how this slide seems more scholarly, which appeals to me.","text",22
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","We recommend that advocates provide something resembling a citation as often as possible in messaging.In written messages, we recommend advertising a link where people can learn more or see the data behind a claim. We doubt that many people will click through, but this can help build trust with the public. Of course, the link should provide the relevant information for those who do investigate, and advocates should be aware thateven slight exaggerations of factual claims will make it easier for people to dismiss our message outright.","text",23
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","Emotional Appeals Are Seen as Manipulative Conventional wisdom among political campaigners holds that voters are more influenced by emotional appeals than detailed arguments about policy. But this is certainly not how our focus group participants thought of themselves. On the contrary, one of the most common reactions was to reject messages seen as appealing to emotions. Such messages were seen as manipulative and offended participants’ view of themselves as rational decision-makers. Men in particular resented emotional messages: ​​This cheapens the credibility of this organization, that they're playing so deeply on the emotional card here. ​It feels manipulative, in the same way that like hunger companies will use the poor starving kids and like a third world country looking sad at the camera, it gives me that vibe. So it's like you're trying to like pull the heartstrings and kind of manipulate me emotionally. This does appear to be an appeal to emotion. That's why the pig's name is given in the paragraph. The only reason for that is to make it more personal so that the reader relates to it more. I do like statistics, I would like to see less hyperbole and less emotion. I'm not persuaded by that. Any language seen as too strongly worded or too absolute was likely to receive this backlash. One participant even objected to “at all” in a message stating “There’s not enough corporate responsibility at all.” However, while many emotional messages evoked a negative response, leaving emotions out entirely was also ineffective.Without drawing an emotional connection to the suffering of animals in farms or the consequences of environmental destruction, participants viewed the entire conversation as irrelevant and dismissed even the mildest policy measures (such as subsidies for meat alternatives). Three Strategies for Emotional Appeals We tested messages with a broad range of emotional registers, from emotionally sterile to very dramatic.","text",24
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","We identified two promising strategies for advocates to incorporate emotions into messaging.","text",25
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","#1: Don’t Be Cringe The first strategy is simply to appeal to emotion using a more restrained tone. We could not find a better way to describe this strategy than in a simple rule of thumb:don’t be cringe.Advocates may be tempted to use emotionally intense language to try to grab the public’s attention, but they should be aware that this language may repel many listeners, to whom it seems hysterical or manipulative. One easy way to adjust the tone of a message is to limit the use of adjectives and adverbs, especially absolutes such asalways, never, orat all. Another is to replace statements with questions, even obviously rhetorical ones. For instance, after receiving feedback, we changed a sentence in one test message from “We have no right to keep doing this to them” to “We focus on our freedom, but what about theirs?” This small change significantly improved responses to the message, which was otherwise one of our most emotionally pointed. What both suggestions in the above paragraph may share in common isleaving more room for the listener to define their own thoughts and feelings about a topic.We suspect that messages full of emotionally charged adjectives (e.g. “outrageous”) may draw a backlash because they feel emotionally prescriptive. Instead, we recommend advocates try to leave some room in their messages for the listener to make connections and come to conclusions on their own. Indeed, the same principle may explain why images were also an effective strategy for emotional appeals. #2: Let Images Do the Talking A simple way to appeal to emotion without appearing hysterical is to rely on images to create an emotional connection with the message. Yet even some images can be seen as manipulative and invoke an anti-emotional response. In our focus groups, images of happy, healthy animals struck a good balance, creating an emotional connection without eliciting a backlash.","text",26
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","Participants rarely suggested these images were proof that humane farming was possible; instead, they described feeling more connected to the animal and more discomfort with the reality of slaughter.","text",27
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","More graphic images of farms and slaughterhouses were powerful as well, though they tested and sometimes exceeded people’s tolerance for overt emotionality. Advocates should be aware that showing images of slaughter may be seen as manipulative. Advocates whose messaging strategy relies on being seen as trustworthy may want to use such images sparingly. Images (such as the one below) of animals’ bodies after slaughter, but before being dismembered into familiar “meat” products, also struck a very effective balance. These images elicited disgust and bridged the mental disconnect between animals and meat. We recommend advocates make far greater use of these images to create a visceral reaction, generating disgust towards meat and making the larger subject of their advocacy emotionally relevant to the audience.","text",28

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","Most people will have a similar emotional response to the image above. But our interviews suggest that in reacting to a photograph, the viewer feels that their emotional response is their own, rather than being prescribed to them: I kind of liked the ad, because it's so brutal. I feel like some people need to see this type of image to wake up. The first thing screaming in my mind is just ‘Yikes, oh my gosh.’ And it's kind of just leaving me with nothing, because I could never imagine myself doing that… Clear, well-lit images of a friendly messenger can also be very effective, especially when the identity of the messenger plays a central role. This case is discussed later on. #3: Explicitly Target the “Anti-Emotion” Frame Participants described emotional appeals as manipulative, saying they preferred arguments based on facts and cold rationality. This argument operates in a frame, one we found to be vulnerable. We experimented with messages that preempted anti-emotional backlash by making the case that emotional reactions to violence against animals are healthy and appropriate. After some iterations, we found these messages to be effective:","text",31

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","Earlier versions of these messages used stronger language. For instance, the reference to “history” in the image on the right was originally more explicit: “History has shown us what happens when we suppress our compassion for others.” Respondents registered this as a veiled Holocaust reference and criticized it. The emotional register in these versions was calibrated through feedback from focus group participants. Some participants found these assertions offensive, but most found them compelling: I think he's right that we should listen to our feelings. I mean, why not? For me, there's a big piece of denial. I know that it's coming from a rational place, I think it seems compassionate. And I wouldn't be offended by it. And I don't think it's harsh. I think it's actually on point, what he's saying. Because these messages were transparently arguing in favor of emotionality, they avoided the objection of being manipulative. This strategy mirrors the “pulling back the curtain” strategy discussed in the previous report in this series, where revealing the frame behind an opposition argument is enough to weaken it. 3.4 Persuasive Messengers We can think of messaging strategy as having three crucial components: themessageitself, themessengerdelivering it, and themethodconveying it to the listener (e.g. a billboard, a social media ad, or a speech at a protest). Each is crucially important. The third is beyond the scope of this report, and the second is discussed only in this section. Yet these might be some of our most useful recommendations. Overall, we found that whileauthorityis often emphasized when choosing messengers, our interviews suggest thatrelatabilityandtrustworthinessare more important. While there was a space for expert messengers, our participants were more likely to be persuaded by ordinary people, people they could see themselves reflected in.","text",40
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","The greatest effect was messengers from demographics people don’t normally associate with veganism or animal rights, and most of all, people who still eat meat.","text",41
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","The Unexpected Power of theMeat-Eating Messenger As we discussed at length in the previous report in this series, the challenge faced by animal advocates is how to overcome inertia among a general public that is already somewhat familiar with the harms of animal agriculture. Specifically, many people have deeply contradictory feelings about meat, feeling deep attachment to it at the same time as being repelled by how it is produced. We also discussed common defensive reactions to advocate messages, and how advocates might use empathy and even validation to create more openness to their message. Empathy and validation may be the best options available to an individual advocate engaging in outreach, but at the level of public messaging, organizations have a more powerful tool available: themeat-eating messenger. The meat-eating messenger is essentially the embodiment of the public’s ambivalence towards meat. They know that meat is harmful and that it would be better overall if we switched away from it. But they still eat it. The meat-eating messenger melts the public’s defensiveness. On one hand, the person delivering the message still eats meat, so they couldn’t possibly be judging the listener. On the other hand, they demonstrate that it’s possible for meat-eaters to actively support the goals of animal advocates. The first character playing this role in our focus groups was a fictional woman named Shanelle. In a news article, Shanelle was part of a group of friends deciding whether or not to sign a petition for a pro-animal ballot measure. One friend stated strong support, and another stated strong opposition. Shanelle fell in the middle: I suppose vegetarians say you don't really need to eat meat. I guess you don't if you can find other sources of protein. But for me, I like a good hamburger, a good steak. But then I feel so bad after seeing all those videos online. She ultimately decides to sign the petition.","text",42
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","Shanelle’s comment was an amalgamation of real quotes from earlier participants in the study. Her authenticity struck a chord:","text",43
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","There's [dissonance] between what you're doing in the moment… eating some meat, and then kind of having to push away the feeling of guilt or shame. As Shanelle said in her comment, I like to eat these things. But then I feel so bad… but I’m not actually doing anything else about it. I think I think this is actually a really good quote, because I feel like this relates to a lot of people because like, even though they kind of feel bad about it, they aren't still willing to give it up. I understand that woman. I think she's being honest and open. But it's almost like she has given up a little bit or something. Like, maybe she didn't have any power. Rather than understanding that she does have that power. And that's kind of what we're talking about. But other participants mistook Shanelle’s message as pro-meat. We wanted to sharpen it, but weren’t sure how far a meat-eating messenger could go before being accused of hypocrisy. The answer was, very far. We tested extensively with messengers who explicitly mentioned that they still eat meat and found that the many pointed messages were most effective coming from a meat eater. The only time meat-eating messengers were accused of hypocrisy was when they were also rich or famous. (Celebrity hypocrisy is discussed more below.) The essence of the meat-eating messenger is that they arerelatable.Rather than being seen as judgemental, they are seen as honest and vulnerable about an internal struggle that many Americans share, though they try to avoid it. This relatability is enhanced by other features of their identity. We especially recommend using meat-eating messengers who represent the demographicsbelieved by the publicto be the least likely to stop eating meat or support the animal rights movement: working-class people, men, people of color, and older people. More importantly, a diverse range of meat-eating messengers will optimize for relatability.","text",44
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","This is not to say that every message will be more effective coming from an “average Joe” working-class meat eater. Messages focused on facts are more persuasive when delivered by experts. The meat-eating messenger is connected to a specific type of message meant to address emotional attachment to meat. Here are some examples of effective messages we tested that clearly conveyed the messenger’s meat-eating identity while still making a pointed comment in support of the animal movement that could credibly (as our participants were concerned) come from a meat-eater.","text",45

Like, it seems like it's just like a citizen, like a Denver voter… I feel like a quote from someone who still eats meat would more be more likely to resonate with people who still eat meat. And personally, I kind of agree that they might not taste like exactly the same. But the difference in similarity is worth the payoff for like an animal's life being saved. I love this one, I find it to be so relatable. That first line, being horrified about the images and loving a good steak. I feel like that's the tension of so many people that I know, myself included. Just to be able to say that out loud, let's have both of those things be true at the same time. I think that's a really powerful way to start. And coming from a working class American, a firefighter makes it somehow really compelling to me. This one's very relatable… it's good to hear from just him being an average voter, you know, his take on it and how he seems to be enjoying the taste, even if it is a little bit different. And knowing that it is a better direction for us to be going. I just find this really relatable. Because like, I mean, I like impossible burgers. I like regular burgers, but like I'm okay with dealing with a step down in taste but also I'm open to like trying other things that aren't fake meat… So I think it's a better direction to just steer clear of meat. Animal Messengers If the animal could walk up to me and say, ‘Hey, don’t eat me,’ then I wouldn’t eat you. Even our participants were able to identify the barrier posed by the fact that animals cannot speak for themselves. Or can they? We wondered how participants would react to a message presented as being spoken by animals themselves. (Many advocates have used images like this before.) Would they find it laughable?","text",58

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","We wanted to use a message simple enough that animals arguably are in fact saying it. After some rounds of testing, we settled on “we don’t want to die”. We also tested “we want to live”, but some participants correctly identified that the goal of animal advocates is for farmed animals not to exist in the first place. We strongly recommend not only using animal images, but presenting animals as messengers. Other Recommendations Concerning Messengers Feature Demographic Diversity, Especially Working-Class, Men, POC, and Elders Demographic diversity definitely matters for animal advocacy. There was a widespread view among our participants that veganism is for “rich white people rather than other demographics” (Liberal woman, 29) and theyounger generation. Advocates should take every opportunity to use messengers to subvert these common misconceptions about the animal rights movement. Working-class men, men of color, Black and Latina women, and older people all disrupt these beliefs when acting as spokespeople for the animal rights movement. Perhaps the most striking example of this in our focus groups was Lupe Morales, the fictional Latina grandmother pictured above. Participants raved over Lupe. Of course, Lupe as a messenger cannot be separated out from the message she shared, about her granddaughter opening her eyes to the issues with using animals for food. This heartwarming story used theyounger generationsstereotype against itself, to great effect: I felt more connected to this on a personal level just because I think about my kids and like the earth that they're going to inherit. So, when she said ‘I want her to live on a healthier planet,’ that's also something that I hold valuable for my own children.","text",69
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","I mean, I always like any type of education or advertisement with storytelling like this, and you're showing somebody that was older and that they would have never thought about not eating meat because that's how they were raised and how they're open to these kinds of changes.","text",70
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","I like that the granddaughter is the one who's educating. You always have a sweet spot for your grandmother, so it's nice to see. I think this has a good point. My daughter has taught me a lot about how to eat better. You know, because for us, we just did what our parents did. So I think that if the younger generation can come in and teach the older ones, I think it's a good thing. Money Undermines Credibility A common concern had to do with the motivations of whoever was behind the ballot measure. Participants suggested they would lose faith if it turned out the measure was being pushed by monied interests. I would want to know if this particular initiative is being funded by someone who has a financial interest in people consuming less meat. It would be useful in figuring out their motives. Participants were also sensitive to rich people, including celebrities, telling them what to do. Especially in light of the common view that eating vegan is expensive, celebrities who did not specifically discuss the affordability of animal-free food were sometimes accused of hypocrisy. I hear a lot of celebrities, like, ‘oh, yeah, I'm vegan. And I also drive an electric car. And I have a mini private jet instead of a private jet.’ And it's like, okay, because you can afford to do that. Good for you. But yeah, a lot of us just don't have the ability to live that way. You probably have a chef. That's how you're able to leave meat behind. These patterns undermined two categories of messengers we tested: celebrities and entrepreneurs. We thought that entrepreneurs leading pioneering animal-free food companies might make good spokespeople, representing a vanguard who have put their own time and money into making an animal-free food system a reality. But people broadly considered them to have too much of a conflict of interest to be trustworthy: The end goal I may agree with, but the speaker, their motives don't sit well with me.","text",71
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","This statement makes it look like it's entirely about the money. And the whole end goal and the whole message is irrelevant at this point.","text",72
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","Money is what motivates people here, it's people's margins that they care about… I feel like this is just a very American statement. ‘We will do this thing. It will make me money. Yeah, the random end result is that the environment’s better and people are healthier, but I'm still making money.’ We recommend against elevating investors and entrepreneurs as spokespeople to the general public, though they may appeal more to conservatives. Meanwhile, we recommend there is a role for celebrity messengers, but they should use caution to avoid being seen as hypocrites. Celebrities are probably an exception to the efficacy of themeat-eating messenger:a rich meat-eating spokesperson would likely be labeled a hypocrite. When appropriate, celebrity advocates should name the affordability and accessibility of meat alternatives as a key issue and present a solution. In doing so, they can be recast as self-aware and down to earth. “Activists” Are Ineffective Care should be taken to present messengers in a role other than activists. Behavior associated with “activists” (e.g. protesting) is often necessary to draw attention to a message, but the messengers should never refer to themselves as activists and should subvert activist stereotypes in their dress and speech. Relatable Photos Participants responded more favorably to photos of messengers whose eyes were clearly visible. This means faces should be well-lit, photo resolution must be high, and the speaker should be facing the camera, ideally wearing a friendly smile. For some messages, feeling connected with the messenger is relatively unimportant. For instance, a message about the cognition of animals is more about animals than the animal behavior expert giving the message; animals are the central character. But themeat-eating messengeris the central character in the story they share. A clear photo of a friendly-looking person strengthens those messages, even when the tone of the message doesn’t necessarily seem friendly.","text",73

In turn, that story can convey one of many narratives that have the potential to undermine the dominant narratives in favor of using animals for food. 4. Proposed Counter-Narratives for Animal Freedom The ultimate goal of this study was to identify narratives that could most effectively build support for the goals of animal advocates. All of the recommendations discussed so far were developed in tandem with these new narratives. This section examines the narratives themselves, providing examples of how our other recommendations can be incorporated. First, what exactly do we mean bynarrative? For the purposes of this report, we borrow thedefinition posed by the FrameWorks Institute:“Narratives are patterns of meaning that cut across and tie together specific stories. They are common patterns that both emerge from a set of stories and provide templates for specific stories.”In other words, while stories have specific characters, scenery, and events,narrativearises when those unique elements in different stories share essential qualities. For instance, thebootstrapsnarrative tells a story of an enterprising person achieving success through their own effort after starting with nothing. According to FrameWorks, “Scholarship across disciplines has identified a set of specific benefits of narrative—effects that narratives are distinctively capable of producing, in comparison to other types of frames…” Here we present the narratives we most recommend, along with ways to improve narratives already popular among advocates.","text",78

This narrative essentially tries to cast the listener in the central role. The goal is to use statements that most people could imagine making themselves, and a messenger they can relate to. Presenting this shift in perspective as a story provides useful subtlety. We tested a more direct message contrasting consumers and voters which did not perform as well:","text",93

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","Theanimal messengerimages shown earlier also portray this narrative. Our participants held a range of views about welfare labels. Some found them trustworthy and felt comforted buying products with high welfare labels. Others considered these labels to be a sham, stating that they don’t mean much. Still others had never thought about common welfare labels or had scarcely even heard terms like “cage-free” and “free range”. Thehumane deceptionnarrative establishes the second view as the common sense view by asserting that it is “no secret” that these labels are deceptive. We first tested the phrase “everyone knows” (borrowed from a participant) but people whodidn’tknow found it off-putting. “No secret” performed better, perhaps because it was more inviting while still establishing that skepticism of humane labels is the norm. We recommend pairinghumane deceptionwith a meat-eating messenger because trustworthiness is key for this narrative. As with many other issues, people have heard conflicting information about animal welfare and they don’t know what to believe. An ordinary meat-eating peer is least likely to be seen as having ulterior motives. We also recommend supportinghumane deceptionwith facts about the impossibility of scaling low-density animal agriculture. Because people are sensitive to the cost of animal-free food, advocates can take this opportunity to emphasize the dramatic cost increases inherent to farming animals this way.

An ordinary peer is not ideal here. We limited the celebrity messengers we tested to those who would plausibly say something supportive of animal freedom. James Cromwell is associated with film roles that portray positive moral role models, and he was warmly received by most of our participants as a moral messenger: I just love James Cromwell so this is very effective for me. As we discussed earlier, however, wealthy celebrity messengers are vulnerable to being seen as hypocrites if they do not explicitly address the issue of affordability.

We found that skillful explanations of scientific processes activated the positivemodernityframe and generated excitement about the transition to animal-free food. We recommend messages explaining the science behind these alternatives using thetrailblazingnarrative. Participants specifically appreciated the strong optimism of this narrative. However, advocates must be aware of the public’s distrust of messengers with a financial interest. Our restaurant owner did not receive this backlash, but meat alternative entrepreneurs did. Where possible, scientists, farmers, and others who aren’t thought of as being financially motivated make the besttrailblazers. Another concern raised by many participants was whether the transition to an animal-free food system would be doneequitably,or if it would replicate current social injustices. We recommend trailblazers name social equity as one of their central motivations, and where appropriate, describe how their approach will reduce inequality. Stuck in the Past In the previous report, we discussed how thefarmer legacynarrative often presented by animal farmers and journalists was unpopular among our participants. This narrative relies on the weakness of that opposition message. We did not test thestuck in the pastnarrative using social media-type stimuli, but this is an excerpt of the text we used for a survey experiment: Barney Lewis, who came from four generations of cattle ranchers, isn’t who you might think of as a typical advocate. “A lot of my neighbors are still clinging to this worn out image of the heroic family farmer struggling to make a living off the land,” Lewis explained to a curious local. “But that just ain’t how it happens anymore.

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","In recent years, there have been increasing calls among advocates to focus more messaging on the suffering of workers inside animal agriculture industries. We tested numerous messages based on worker welfare. The most common issue we encountered with worker-focused messages is that participants did not believe issues of worker abuse are isolated in the slaughter industry. They immediately connected such messages to larger issues in labor relations, and suggested that the solution has little to do with regulating animal agriculture specifically. This distracted from the issues animal advocates hope to focus on. There's horrible work conditions for humans, not just in the United States, but across the world. And we're not going to go after the food industry first because of work conditions alone. it seems like they're conflating labor issues with animal rights issues, as if they're making the argument that there is something inherent in working in a slaughterhouse that prevents good working conditions. And I think those are separate issues. The key to overcoming this is to clearly emphasize the harms that are unique and inherent to working in a slaughterhouse, namely the proven psychological harms of killing all day.

But working this connection into the form of a story was difficult. One reason stories are useful is they help people remember facts, which is crucial because the public is much less aware of the environmental harms of animal ag (compared to the animal welfare-related harms). We feel there is clearly a role for climate-centered messaging, but we believe more research is needed to find more memorable ways to package those messages. 5. Policy Demands We also gauged participants’ reactions to various policy measures. The fictional ballot measure presented by the interviewer ranged from banning slaughterhouses in one state by 2028 or animal farming by 2035, to merely providing government subsidies to animal-free food alternatives. Here’s what we found 5.1 Radical Flank Effects Sociologist Herbert Haines describes thepositive radical flank effectas when “the bargaining position of moderates is strengthened by the presence of radical groups.” We clearly observed a microcosm of the radical flank effect in our participants’ reactions to different policy demands. The first round of focus groups were presented with a ballot measure to end the operation of slaughterhouses in one state by 2028. Participants agreed this was far too extreme and proposed more moderate solutions: a slower timeline, or a sin tax on meat. In the next round, the timeline was more than doubled, to 2035. Again, participants felt this was too extreme, so we changed the proposal for the next round to a meat tax paying for a meat-alternative subsidy. In the absence of a slaughterhouse ban, participants found this proposal far too extreme. Even after we eliminated the tax completely, participants described it as “going from zero to 100.” They suggested a simple public education program instead.","text",165
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","For most participants, while they may have mixed feelings about meat, any negative feelings are more than overridden by negative feelings toward change. While the right messages can help a great deal, our interviews suggest that ultimately, advocates will be dragging the public along if any meaningful change is to occur.","text",166
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","We recommend the animal movement should capitalize on this particular radical flank effect. Whatever policy objectives the movement wishes to enact in the short term, we should ensure that significantly more ambitious proposals are in the public’s awareness and are even being actively pursued by a credible radical element. Our findings suggest that from a public opinion perspective, the radical flank has a vital role to play in building acceptance for the movement’s short-term goals. Note that this recommendation does not necessarily have to do with radicalmethods,only with radical policy demands. The animal movement’s radical flank does not necessarily need to throw molotov cocktails (or evencans of soup) to make moderate demands seem reasonable. Using compassionate messages and working within the bounds of the law to advance a meat ban on a short timeline might suffice to create the desired effect. 5.2 Nonrestrictive Policy Remedies Our participants almost categorically preferred policy solutions which do not directly restrict choice. On one end of this spectrum, any type of ban was seen negatively. On the other end were toothless proposals like an “education program”. Between these two extremes, however, advocates should know that there could be highly impactful government programs that are not seen as directly impacting consumer choice. The most prominent from our research is subsidizing animal-free alternatives. This idea was repeatedly generated by our participants and remained relatively popular when the interviewer presented it. Generally, the approach of trying to make animal-free food the more affordable option was seen as effective and appropriate, so much so that a reasonable number of participants even supported funding it with a meat tax. Meat taxes alone are seen as further towards the restrictive side of the spectrum. We tested a message framing a state-level meat tax as cancelling out federal subsidies.","text",167
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","This had some success, but we anticipate it would be difficult to make this connection outside of such a long-form conversation.","text",168

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","Participants also repeatedly generated a proposal for the government to help animal farmers transition. This proposal was very strong from a messaging standpoint. We recommend advocates further investigate policy goals that could fit this description. 5.3 Affordability is an Opportunity One of the most pervasive objections in this round of research had to do with the affordability of animal-free food. Many participants saw the price of animal-free food alternatives as a major obstacle to more widespread adoption. This objection proved challenging to address through any kind of reframing; veganism being expensive was a widely shared belief that was confirmed by participants’ own experiences at the grocery store. If this cost cannot be addressed through clever messaging, it still presents advocates with an opportunity. By focusing their political objectives on the price of animal-free foods, advocates could turn a major objection into a point of cohesion with the broader public. Messengers advocating for government money to make animal-free foods moreaffordable and accessiblewere seen favorably by our participants. We recommend advocates consider policy demands focused on decreasing the cost of animal-free foods. At the least, including such measures in a broader package will help the public see that animal advocates are in touch with the concerns of ordinary people. 6. Conclusion In the previous phase of the study, we uncovered numerous insights into how the public thinks about animals used for food. The goal of this phase was to design persuasive messages based on those insights. Through over 60 hours of feedback from ordinary meat eaters, we refined the tone, messengers, and narratives of these messages into recommendations that can benefit any public-facing animal advocacy.","text",171
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","Some recommendations (such as those around animal messengers and thehumane deceptionnarrative) refine messaging strategies already in wide use, while others (like meat-eating messengers and theconsumer-voter conversion) open up entirely new strategies.","text",172
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/developing-a-messaging-strategy-to-end-animal-farming-using-focus-groups/","Compared to the previous phase, part of our goal was to more closely approximate the way people usually encounter animal advocate messages. Extended conversations are important but they are a rare opportunity; a great deal of our interaction with the public comes in social media ads or short quotes in news stories. If the design of these focus groups was a step in that direction, the ongoing stages of this study go even further using survey experiments.

"https://paxfauna.org/examining-the-value-of-open-rescue-in-light-of-the-smithfield-victory/","The Gist: When piglets Lilly and Lizzie wererescuedfrom a giant pig farm, their rescuers spoke openly about what they had done. A multi-year FBI investigation and state felony prosecution followed. At the end of their trial, supporters expected them to go to prison, potentially for years. The rescuers had gotten their affairs in order. We thought they’d be held in custody between the verdict and sentencing. We wondered how they would do in their yearly parole board hearings, given that they’d never express remorse. This was goodbye for a long time. I was in the courtroom when the decision was announced. It all started the way we expected. After deliberating for nearly eight hours, the jury entered the room, stone-faced. They didn’t look at us. The judge asked if the jury had come to a decision. They had. The bailiff passed the written decision between the judge, the foreperson, and the clerk. But then something strange happened. Charge by charge, we heard the words “not guilty.” It was a fantastic moment. We were elated. The bailiff scolded us gently, saying, “I get it, but you need to be quiet.” But how were we supposed to be quiet when the unbelievable had happened? The judge had referred to Lilly and Lizzie by name. The jurors had asked why we didn’t rescue more piglets. We had argued for rescue in a court of law, and we hadwon. This moment of sweetness was particularly unexpected for me. In the years since I’d participated in Open Rescue myself, I had grown doubtful about our hopes that it would produce wins in the courtroom. After all, I served as DxE’s legal coordinator for a little over two years- hiring lawyers, setting up defendant meetings, and occasionally talking down the worried parent of an activist facing charges. In all this time, of dozens of criminal defendants, not one went to trial.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/examining-the-value-of-open-rescue-in-light-of-the-smithfield-victory/","Cases were dropped, activists took deals so they wouldn’t need to continue their cases, and mostly, cases were delayed long past the point when I, impatient with the glacial pace of the legal system, left DxE to start Pax Fauna.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/examining-the-value-of-open-rescue-in-light-of-the-smithfield-victory/","Now that the celebrations are over and regular work resumes, this post is an attempt to make an honest assessment of Open Rescue as a tactic to create social change for animals, in light of a victory we never expected. A Moment to Re-evaluate The rescue of Lilly and Lizzie happened on March 7, 2017, and their rescuers, Wayne Hsiung and Paul Darwin Picklesimer, were acquitted over five years later, on October 8, 2022. In 2017, DxE was releasing open rescues monthly, conducting mass trainings, and hoping that open rescue would end up being a viral tactic that would touch every farm and slaughterhouse in the world. Since then, DxE has moved away from open rescue. At one point, Wayne had 17 pending felony charges, which seemed like plenty. Most of the cases took years to resolve (several are still plodding through pretrial hearings), and, without making it to trial, they didn’t always get the media attention we hoped for. Now that long-awaited evidence of the outcomes of Open Rescue cases are available, it is a prime moment for the movement to consider using it again. In this article, we’ll outline the lessons learned for the animal freedom movement from the Smithfield victory, and the implications for future strategy. A Legal Theory that Worked But First, the Parts that Didn’t One defense strategy batted around in the heyday of DxE’s open rescues was that we could convince a jury to simply ignore unjust laws and make a decision based on their conscience, known asjury nullification. But it seems that’s not exactly what happened here. The jury did not explicitly decide that rescue is moral and Paul and Wayne didn’t deserve to be punished- they decided that the prosecution didn’t meet its burden of proof that the particular crimes charged had been committed. (From juror interviews afterwards, it seems that a moral motivation was also present, at least for some.) It also wasn’t a case that created a binding legal precedent.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/examining-the-value-of-open-rescue-in-light-of-the-smithfield-victory/","That means that nothing has changed regarding the legality of open rescue. Of course, activists hope cases like this can set a cultural precedent, and they can also be used aspersuasive authority,information that informs, but does not dictate, the actions of judges in the future, even outside of the state of Utah.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/examining-the-value-of-open-rescue-in-light-of-the-smithfield-victory/","Another piece to the theory whose result was inconclusive was thenecessity defense- a legal concept in which a criminal act is justified if it prevents immediate, greater harm. The judge in this case forbade DxE from introducing it (as usually happens for animal and environmental activists hoping to claim it), but it would sound something like this: Paul and Wayne knew that animals were suffering terribly inside Circle Four Farms, and they were justified in committing trespass, a smaller harm, in order to stop a greater harm- criminal animal cruelty. While it was explictly forbidden, this defense was both implied by the defendants in their discussion of the poor health of Lillie and Lizzie, and possibly common sense to the jurors who aquitted. My guess is that the necessity defense represents an unquantifiable moral component to this case. It can’t be expected to earn aquittals by itself, since it’s rarely included in jury instructions, but it’s necessary for winning over juries all the same. (You can hear more from the jurors at an upcoming by the Denver Animal Activist Defense Project.) Felonies Schmelonies Itwas, however, a proof of concept of part of a legal theory that Wayne and DxE have been touting for years- that under the right circumstances, diligent open rescue investigators won’t be guilty of any crime more serious than trespass. (In Utah, prosecutors must choose between charging burglary and trespass- this isn’t true everywhere.) Because investigators enter farms with only the intent of documenting what’s happening in the facility, they aren’t guilty of burglary, which generally requires entering a building with the intent to commit a theft or felony. Because the animals they rescue are on the verge of death, they aren’t guilty of theft, which usually requires that one steal something of value.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/examining-the-value-of-open-rescue-in-light-of-the-smithfield-victory/","However, courts and juries do not always agree with activists in the assessment of the monetary value of sick rescued animals, or the relevance of animal’s value, such as in Wayne’s own conviction at trial after rescuingRain, a baby goat with pneumonia. (Another upcoming test will come from my own charges of burglary and theft in association with the rescue ofbeaglesfrom a breeding and testing facility in Wisconsin, each valued at $1200.) In the future, activists may be able to set themselves up for success by rescuing animals whose urgent medical needs cost more than they are worth to the farm. (Of course, specific laws and jury instructions will vary according to circumstances and jurisdictions, and I’m writing this from the perspective of an activist and not an attorney or legal expert.)","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/examining-the-value-of-open-rescue-in-light-of-the-smithfield-victory/","Difficulties with OR as a Tactic Possible downsides to Open Rescue as a strategy could be the cost, the difficulty of replicating the legal strategy, and a risk of an undesirable media narrative. None of these seem insurmountable for a savvy group of activists. Costs Costs of the investigation itself can be in the realm of a few thousand dollars- lower if equipment (e.g. cameras) is used for multiple investigations. These include flights and hotels for a small team, a rental car, biosecurity supplies, and vet visits. The legal fees are where it really adds up. Lawyers can cost tens of thousands of dollars, to which we can add the price of specialized investigators or jury studies, additional tens of thousands of dollars. This price might be comparable to undercover investigations, which require a salary for an investigator for months in addition to the equipment and costs associated with preparing the story for release. However, the vast majority of Open Rescues were never prosecuted, resulting in a very low average cost overall. Charisma Watching Wayne Hsiung represent himself in court, I was struck by the thought that he was the most qualified person in the world for this particular task- a lawyer and practiced public speaker who had been preparing for this moment for years. This might lead one to conclude that others can’t replicate his strategy, but I disagree. While Wayne’s decision to represent himself made for some exciting theater, I don’t believe it was necessary for the verdict. As touching as it was to hear him say to the jury, “I don't actually want you to acquit us on a legal technicality, I want you to acquit us as a matter of conscience” it seems that they probablywereacquitted on a legal technicality as discussed above- the piglets didn’t have any monetary value, and perhaps that they didn’t have the intent to rescue when they entered the farm.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/examining-the-value-of-open-rescue-in-light-of-the-smithfield-victory/","I believe that with competent counsel and no particular gift for public speaking, this case implies that other investigators could have a decent chance of acquittal from serious charges under similar sets of facts. (That’s not to say that any lawyer will do- competent and dedicated activist attorneys are vital and rare. Advice on their selection would easily fill a blog of the same length.)","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/examining-the-value-of-open-rescue-in-light-of-the-smithfield-victory/","Narrative A final concern with Open Rescue that I want to address is the narrative put forth through the media. DxE can be considered aliberationistgroup. That is, they are not interested in lowering the mortality rates of piglets in factory farms or winning slightly bigger cages for egg-laying hens- they mean to advocate for animals as individuals who deserverights. However, this insistence on liberation over welfare doesn’t always get through to the media. Of the Smithfield Investigation, the most widely consumed coverage came from the New York Times, the subtitle of which read, “The Utah trial highlighted what the defendants argued is a lack of transparency for the treatment of animals at large corporate farms.” It also included a discussion of corporate transparency, gestation crates, and a quote from Wayne Hsuing saying “Instead of trying to put us in prison… the better thing to do is just take care of your animals.” Facing a trial and serious criminal consequences, it can be tempting for a defendant or organization to adapt their message to one that may be perceived as more palatable and more likely to win the case and woo the media. However, unlike many of DxE’s other Open Rescues that focused on dispellingthe Humane Myth,the Smithfield Investigation’s narrative was more focused oncorporate liesaround welfare. (The company had previously vowed to phase out gestation crates, while its largest facility still used them.) I don’t believe that Open Rescue itself implies a welfare angle if the advocates behind it don’t want one. Upsides Storytelling In contrast with undercover operations, Open Rescue allows for a quality of storytelling that allows the audience to identify a single victim to feel empathy for. Discussion of particularly cruel practices or deceptive marketing can be accompanied by the story of an individual who survived, transforming a dark story about corporate wrongdoing into one containing a vision for change.","text",12
"https://paxfauna.org/examining-the-value-of-open-rescue-in-light-of-the-smithfield-victory/","These stories are also strengthened by the honesty of the activists, their willingness to break unjust laws in the open and demand their day in court.","text",13
"https://paxfauna.org/examining-the-value-of-open-rescue-in-light-of-the-smithfield-victory/","Additionally, Open Rescue allows for the telling of many different stories- ones that may resonate on social media, traditional media, with lawmakers, and for juries, all of whom have different interests. While the media may not pick up every case of open rescue, if we try enough different ways, eventually some of them will blow up. Activist Transformation Open Rescue allows activists to be transformed by what they see. Now, when we speak about animals, we have firsthand knowledge of their lives and deaths. The risk we take in conducting Open Rescue functions as a signal of our commitment, to ourselves and to others. DxE’s mass open rescues and a similar tactic used by Meat the Victims transformed hundreds of activists into people with firsthand experience. Importantly, this experience is of bearing witness and also of helping. By rescuing animals, or at least stopping the functioning of the facility for some time, activists’ witnessing of violence is accompanied by intervening, leading to more empowerment and less burnout than bearing witness on its own. Open Rescue transforms not only the activists’ internal sense of motivation but also their credibility as messengers to the public: from here on, they can attest as eyewitnesses to the barbarity of animal farming. Untapped Potential To date, Open Rescue has done important work attransforming activists, challengingthe humane myth, uncoveringpreviously unknown atrocities, and earning a voice in the media, not to mention saving real lives. In the future, Open Rescue could be used in even more creative ways than we’ve previously seen. For just one example, in the context of an animal rights ballot measure, donors to the opposition could be identified and their farms could be investigated by groups unaffiliated with the ballot measure, with investigations published just before election day.","text",14
"https://paxfauna.org/examining-the-value-of-open-rescue-in-light-of-the-smithfield-victory/","This would provide both important publicity for the issue and accountability to those who would financially support an anti-animal position.","text",15
"https://paxfauna.org/examining-the-value-of-open-rescue-in-light-of-the-smithfield-victory/","Until Every Cage is Empty The full potential of Open Rescue as a tactic has yet to be fully realized. While it’s understandable that, in the period of time where many charges were pending and few were resolved, activists moved away from it, the time is now right to reinvest energy in openly investigating violent facilities and rescuing the animals we find there. We hope to see open rescue happen by greater numbers of activists, at greater frequency, and to save more lives than has been possible before.

"https://paxfauna.org/the-movement-needs-a-repair-kit/","These blogs are an attempt to put the content of Eva’s NVC trainings online into a readable format. If you missed them, here are previous blogs in this series. Part One:why we study nonviolence Part Two: thepractice of empathy Part Three: the building blocks of empathy,feelings and needs Part Four:observations and requests Part Five:beginning a practice in NVC Part Six:when enemies appear The Gist: In navigating the complex and often strained landscape of movement relationships, empathy is essential. The process outlined in this blog serves not only as a framework for mending the rifts caused by unintended harm but also as a reflection of our own shared values. By taking the time to truly comprehend the impact of our actions, express genuine sorrow, and actively work towards a solution, we foster a movement culture of responsibility, introspection, and constant improvement. In embracing our fallibility without discarding our integrity, we honor not just the relationships we seek to repair but also the very essence of our interdependence. In the most basic sense, Nonviolent Communication gives us two options in every moment: we can give empathy to someone else’s experience or we can express our own, and we can do either of these silently or out loud. Certain exercises can guide us in how we make these choices in certain moments. This exercise is for moments when we’ve made an impact on someone else that we don’t enjoy. This process doesn’t require that we believe that we were in the wrong or that we would necessarily make another choice in the future, but is for situations where we care about the impact we’ve made and want to repair the relationship. This process can be emotionally difficult because it asks you to focus completely on the needs of the receiver (the person who experienced harm). A self-empathy process, such as described in the last piece in this series, may be helpful in preparing yourself.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/the-movement-needs-a-repair-kit/","In making a repair, imagine answering three questions that the other person has:","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/the-movement-needs-a-repair-kit/","Do you get why I was hurt? Does it matter to you that I was hurt? Where do we go from here? In addition to apologizing to and seeking forgiveness from another person, an alternate use for this exercise could be as a role-play when someone else’s actions harmedyou.Even role-playing this conversation with someone playing the part of the other person can help us to resolve our hurt. This stage comes first. In it, offer empathy. Hear out the other person completely, reflecting back the content of what they’re saying, their feelings, and their needs, and checking for understanding. Questions that might help you in this process include: Do you get it? Once it feels like you do—and once the other person reports feeling understood—you’re ready for the next step. Mourning means expressing your own feelings in relation to the impact of your actions. As you pay remember from the piece onempathy, this involves keeping a metaphorical spotlight on the other person, even while discussing our own feelings and needs in relation to theirs. To offer this step, ask something like, “Would you like to hear what it’s like for me to hear you?” Consider three types of mourning. Let’s imagine a scenario where I was late to a high-stakes meeting, causing my colleague embarrassment and stress. Type 1: When I see your pain, I feel pain. When I hear how much stress you’re experiencing, it brings up sadness for me because I want this work to be sustainable for you and I really value your contributions to the work. Type 2: When I see the impacts of my actions, I feel pain. When I hear how much of an impact my being late to the meeting had, I feel a lot of regret. Type 3: When I see that my impact didn’t align with my values, I feel pain. I want to be someone who others can depend on. When I see that I didn’t live up to that and it had such a negative impact, I feel heartbroken. It’s important to note that this stage is not about self-flagellation.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/the-movement-needs-a-repair-kit/","We can mourn the impacts of our actions without discarding or disrespecting ourselves. It might be delicate to express mourning without that landing as self-punishment. If the receiver jumps in to defend you, such as by saying, “It’s not that big of a deal, everyone makes mistakes,” you might try something to clarify like, “Of course, I can accept that I make mistakes. I still want you to know that it matters to me that my mistake hurt you.”","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/the-movement-needs-a-repair-kit/","To move on from this step, ask something like, “How does it feel for you to hear this?” If the receiver expresses more pain, return to giving them empathy. Does it matter? Once you’ve fully mourned with them, the receiver will know that the negative impact matters to you, and thattheymatter to you. Offering an Explanation An optional step to this process is to offer an explanation for your behavior. Someone who experienced an impact from your actions might be asking, “Why did you do it?” This might be a request for empathy, for you to reflect a sense of shock or disgust that the person has with your actions. So keep listening and offering empathy for the receiver’s perspective as much as possible, before in any way explaining your own perspective. If this kind of question comesagain, after some empathy has already landed, it might be a request for information. At that point, you can offer to share what needs you were trying to meet when you did what you did. Offer with something like, “Would it help to hear a bit about what I was thinking in that moment?” Finally, consider any requests or offers you can make going forward. These will be extremely specific to the situation, but might be solutions to prevent the same thing from happening in the future, to literally repair the harm done, or to act out the care you’ve spoken by contributing to the other person in some other way. For example, I might express a plan to set an alarm or turn on calendar notifications to stop myself from being late in the future. I might offer to share information with some third party so that my colleague is saved from embarrassment. I might even offer to do some piece of unglamorous work that my colleague would otherwise do in order to demonstrate care and make it up to her. Moving On In the process outlined above, we can make better apologies to reach genuine forgiveness and relationship repair, strengthening not only the movement but also ourselves.","text",8

After interviewing hundreds of ordinary Americans about their views on using animals for food and noticing the themes represented in the quote above, I rereadHatchet, an iconic young adult novel in which a 13-year-old boy named Brian gets stranded in the Canadian wilderness and, against all odds, figures out how to survive. I was struck by how, despite my dedication to animal freedom, I found myself rooting for Brian as he killed and dismembered fishes, birds, and rabbits. For years, I’ve rolled my eyes when people bring up theirancestorsor what’snaturalto justify eating animals, but in readingHatchetsuddenly I was able to understand something important behind these justifications that had seemed so shallow to me before. By imagining a sympathetic character holding those same objections, this essay will explore a strategy for an empathy-first persuasion approach. I’ll present a model for understanding society’s attachment to eating animals as a distant intergenerational trauma response, illustrated by quotes from interview participants in ouranimal rights messaging study. I’ll share how Brian,Hatchet’s fictional protagonist, helped me see this all more clearly. Most importantly, I’ll give you tools for how to respond when you come up against this in your own advocacy for animals. Intergenerational Trauma At Pax Fauna, we believe in storytelling as a vehicle for change, and inHatchet,we’re invited into Brian’s world. So let’s imagine what it would be like to understand Brian, and in doing so, understand the cultural forces supporting animal agriculture.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/dispelling-carnism-at-its-intergenerational-roots/","Brian’s Trauma is Our Trauma I came to seeHatchetas representing something deeper than the exciting adventure book I experienced as a kid. Brian’s situation is an acute version of the situation our ancestors found themselves in for countless generations- often in mortal danger or a few wrong moves from starvation.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/dispelling-carnism-at-its-intergenerational-roots/","The concept of intergenerational trauma explains how ordinary people who’ve never had an experience like Brian’s could still have the same reaction to animal advocates. First observed in acute historical tragedies- the Holocaust and the Armenian genocide- intergenerational trauma is a phenomenon in which trauma symptoms appear in children and grandchildren of people who experienced trauma. Put simply, trauma is often passed around in society like an electrical signal in the brain- always moving but never gone. One person expresses their trauma in a way that harms another, which can be metabolized as its own trauma. It’s important to understand that intergenerational trauma is not only passed down through abuse or neglect but also by transmitting a worldview shaped by trauma, one that emphasizes fear and victimhood or stoicism and self-reliance6, or even throughepigenetics,changes in how the bodies of younger generations express genes caused by experiences of their ancestors. It would be great if our lives could be a Disney movie, you know? But it's not. You know, it's just not. Acting Out Trauma Responses Killing to Survive Unfortunately, they still have to be killed. I don't like it. But in order for you to get the nutrients that you need, it's necessary. And I don't think there's really any way to get around it. Brian was put into a situation where many animal advocates would agree that killing an animal is morally acceptable- it seemed that if he didn’t, he would die. As his eating became routine, I wondered what it would be like for him to return to society after having had the experience of killing and dismembering animals out of necessity. If Brian was a target of our advocacy, my guess is that he would have a desperate need to be heard on his experience, his relationship with animals, and the depth of his connection with nature.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/dispelling-carnism-at-its-intergenerational-roots/","If we tried to immediately appeal to how unnecessary it is for himnowto eat animals, he’d be frustrated with us for not hearing him, and this need to be heard might be so great that it could present as hostility.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/dispelling-carnism-at-its-intergenerational-roots/","Stuck in the Past Reading about Brian crash-landing a plane alone into the Canadian wilderness, I found myself viewing his situation in a much different light than I had as a child- by repeatedly coming so close to dying, and by doing so totally alone, Brian undoubtedly experienced a world-changing trauma.  Bessel Van Der Kolk, MD, one of the world’s leading experts on trauma, writes inThe Body Keeps the Score, “trauma [is] experienced not as memories but as disruptive physical reactions in the present.” That’s to say that, when coming face to face with reminders of the trauma such as the question of eating animals, Brian might exhibit somedysregulationof his nervous system- strong emotions that, to an outside observer, might seem completely irrational. Animal advocates are familiar with this level of objection- people who become angry and argumentative upon learning that you eat differently than them. Trauma educatorSarah Peyton writes about another level of faulty thinking that can be formed through trauma. “[In the face of trauma,] we learn to make unconscious contracts with ourselves that are attempting to keep us safe, but often end up creating self-sabotage and preventing self-kindness.” That is, when, in a traumatic situation, we learn strategies to survive, those strategies often persist past the point that they’re useful. This applies, for Brian, both to the act of eating animals and the cognitive trick of objectifying them. The part of Brian that holds trauma (the amygdala5, for you technically inclined) can’t tell time, and remains as if “frozen in time in the traumas [he] experienced.”4as described by Schwartz and Morrisette, authors of No Bad Parts: Healing Trauma and Restoring Wholeness with the Internal Family Systems Model. It wouldn’t know that Brian was safely returned to modern society- it’s still as awake as it was in the woods, watching for danger and prey.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/dispelling-carnism-at-its-intergenerational-roots/","When Brian learned to objectify animals as a survival mechanism in the face of trauma, that could have persisted long after his rescue.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/dispelling-carnism-at-its-intergenerational-roots/","Humans, as a species, are reluctant to change. Because change means something new and new things are scary. And it goes back to our hunter days, in the dark, huddling around the campfires and all that, you know…. Anything new was a threat or a potential threat. And we still sort of have that instinct, you know, baked into our DNA. Legacy When we challenge the moral validity of eating animals, it may sound to some like we are dismissing the entire legacy upon which we’ve built our lives. While we express compassion for animals, they hear disrespect towards the sacrifice others have made for us to be here. When people bring up their ancestors eating meat, indigenous people who hunt, or lions, they’re defending the validity of the very ground on which they stand. We can consider this particular form of defensiveness a deeply held trauma response formed long, long ago. I'm questioning… why we're calling [plant-based eating] responsible when, for other cultures, part of their culture is to eat meat. So it's a taking away from their heritage calling this responsible when for them, this is the irresponsible choice of not following what their ancestors have grown up on. The Path Out Trauma needs empathy and warmth to heal. Van Der Kolkwrites that “Recovery from trauma involves (re)connecting with our fellow human beings.” To understand what society might need to heal the trauma response of animal exploitation, let’s consider the empathy Brian might need before being convinced to support animal freedom. Until we’ve empathized fully with the terror of living in fear of starvation, we can’t address the trauma of killing animals. Brian would still be defensive over his decision to kill animals until he’s fully heard about the desperation that led him there. First of all, people have been killing animals since the beginning of time… I just kind of feel like it's just, that's the way it is. Someone's on top and someone's at the bottom.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/dispelling-carnism-at-its-intergenerational-roots/","Resilience Brian might also need to be acknowledged for his resilience. He doesn’t regret doing what he needed to do to survive. In fact, he’s proud of himself for the strength, determination, and intelligence he displayed by surviving in the bush with no preparation.  He doesn’t want to abandon his resilience, and no one wants to abandon the resilience it took for their ancestors to survive. When people express an attachment to meat, fur, or other animal products as a cultural symbol of success and abundance, they may need acknowledgment, and even celebration, of their resilience.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/dispelling-carnism-at-its-intergenerational-roots/","What’s more, Brian feels a profound connection to nature, probably far greater than you or I do. He feels gratitude for the animals he killed and has peace with the fact that he killed them. Saying [eating meat is] unnecessary would be unfair to, say, indigenous cultures, because they have a very spiritual reverence and respectful relationship with the animals that they take the lives of. And I think if we listen to indigenous wisdom, we could find a way to revolutionize our relationship with animals that we do kill. Loss of the Natural World The final piece Brian might need empathy on, in order to be able to hear an animal freedom message, is his grief at having left the woods behind. He felt connected to nature, and now he’s surrounded by people who don’t understand him and only want to talk about things that seem frivolous to him. In the woods, after a while, he felt in his element. His senses were elevated- he noticed every little detail. In the city, he’s bombarded by noise. There is certainly parallel grief held in the collective consciousness. Deep down, many (or perhaps all) of us are mourning our severance with the natural world. We can recognize it whenever people reject modernity for its own sake, such as discomfort with cultured meat or B12 supplements. What would it sound like to empathize with that grief before asking for movement on animals? Empathy for the Irrational In a sequel, Brian’s Return, Brian has difficulty adjusting to modern life. He feels stressed, alienated, and when triggered, viciously attacks a classmate. It isn’t until he meets someone who listens to him with empathy that he’s able to find a pathway out of his distress.","text",12
"https://paxfauna.org/dispelling-carnism-at-its-intergenerational-roots/","As tempting as it may be to respond to arguments about respect for nature, culture, and legacy, with another argument, such as by declaring that it’s unnecessary to eat meat in the modern world or by introducing evidence that humans fare better on a vegan diet, we recommend connecting first with the values that the argument is coming from and connecting with those values the best you can. That might sound something like this:","text",13
"https://paxfauna.org/dispelling-carnism-at-its-intergenerational-roots/","I hear you bring up lions eating gazelles in nature, and I can respond to that, but first I want to make sure I understand where it’s coming from. Is it important to you to be connected to the natural world? Me too, very much, and I’d love to hear more about your sense of connection to nature… For humans to not think of ourselves as separate from nature? Yeah, I feel that too, like, I feel really sad when people talk about these pie-in-the-sky technological solutions to climate change because I don’t think we can just invent ourselves out of every problem. Is it kind of like that? Connecting first on the shared values behind the argument, however frustrating, is a way to disarm the defensiveness born from trauma and hopefully, help someone give themselves permission to change their mind. If my ancestors didn't hunt, I probably wouldn't be here today. Because I mean, that's what we had to do for survival. But I mean, I think some people would also say that, I mean, it's kind of unethical when we're in a point, you know, in the world where we don't have to do that. It's not like 1850, and I'm, you know, a pioneer in California, killing a bear for meat or something, and it just doesn't work like that anymore. Like, I can go to the store, I don't have to go and shoot an animal or, you know, catch a fish to eat. Moving Forward In the author’s note followingBrian’s Return,we learn that the author, Gary Paulsen, is a vegetarian. If Paulsen, a vegetarian who believes it’s wrong to kill animals, can write a story so sympathetic to the hunter in our history, surely we can all afford to employ a little empathy in our advocacy.  In an interview on NPR, he said of a time in his life before he even publishedHatchet,""And I'd quit trapping because I don't - I decided that it was not correct to kill animals. And I'm not going to get into a big controversial thing, but for me, it's not the right thing to do.","text",14

"https://paxfauna.org/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge/","An icon of fork bracelet inscribed with “The Liberation Pledge” The Failure of the Pledge and a Better Way Towards Vegan Tables In 2015, animal advocates with Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) launched an inspired new campaign among their members. It took courage, required sacrifice, and greatly backfired. This three-part series examines what the movement learned from the Liberation Pledge, how we might energize the intention behind the Pledge in a better way, and a piece to share with friends and family to do just that. What We Learned From the Liberation Pledge How It Started The Liberation Pledge was a fascinating idea and a bit of a disaster. Instead of energizing supporters’ social networks to create change, as its creators intended, it often had the opposite effect- to isolate advocates from their closest relationships. In this piece, you’ll learn The next piece in this series suggests a better way to energize the intention behind the pledge, for animal advocates to align their actions with their values in their personal relationships. The Liberation Pledge was a three-part public pledge to Enthusiasts of the pledge hoped it would create acultural stigmaaround eating animals similar to the stigma that has developed around smoking over recent decades. That is, even while smoking is still practiced, it is prohibited by default in public and private spaces. Before we had the Pledge, many of us felt alienated from friends and family who continued to eat animals. We were forced to choose between two options: speaking up and risking being seen as obnoxious, angry, and argumentative, or keeping the peace with painful inauthenticity, swallowing our intense discomfort at watching our loved ones eat the bodies of animals. The pledge gave us hope that there was another way: being honest with those around us while continuing to spend time with them.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge/","And, on a larger scale, we hoped that if we all joined together, we could create a world where eating meat is stigmatized: a world where someone would ask, “Does anyone mind if I get the steak?” before making an order at a restaurant (or maybe even one in which restaurants would think twice before putting someone’s body on the menu).","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge/","Some people took it a step further, arguing it was immoralnotto take the pledge, saying, “You wouldn’t sit quietly eating your vegan option while a dog or a child was being eaten, would you?” According to this view, it was our duty not to sit idly by while violence was committed in our presence. While some beautiful and inspiring stories were detailed on a Facebook group for the Pledge, it seemed to me that there were many more instances of total disaster: people experiencing huge ruptures in their oldest relationships around the Pledge while often lamenting that those they had just discarded  “care more about eating dead animals than they care about me.” From where I stood, the biggest effect of the Pledge was for advocates to lose relationships with family members who didn’t comply. Upon taking the Pledge, a close friend at the time experienced a years-long estrangement from their family,including those who were already veganwhile many others decided to skip birthdays, weddings, and holidays with family. It’s possible that all of this added stigma around eating animals. With these relationships broken down, we don’t know. My Liberation Pledge I believe the pledge was so popular because it politicized something that we desperately wanted for our own comfort–no animals on the table while we were there–and I took it pretty much as soon as it launched. The Pledge certainly contributed to my alienation from nonvegans, though I neither experienced the best nor the worst of it. My immediate family accommodated a request for vegetarian tables at holiday dinners, but I’m sure that there were many invitations I would have received if not for it. While my overall immersion in the animal rights community during that time certainly deserves some of the credit for the fact that I didn’t develop many new relationships with nonvegans during the following several years, the effect of the Pledge can’t be discounted.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge/","A website was created with advice for taking the pledge, which is still online as of this writing. It suggested that pledge-takers write a public statement (a model announcement is provided) to inform their friends and family about their new commitment. It also offered some logistical suggestions for getting together with friends and family who aren’t willing to cooperate with the rules of the Pledge. Most importantly, it laid out the reasoning for why we must, together, participate in the Liberation Pledge (to stigmatize eating animals) and directs the reader to “stay firm and nonviolent in the face of conflict.”","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge/","This was the right kind of advice, but it fell far short. With the benefit of hindsight, we can say that the founders of the Liberation Pledge underestimated just how difficult an undertaking they were proposing.In fact, the pledge in practice often had the opposite of its intended effect, an outcome that profoundly undermined DxE’s central theory of change.DxE believed in the power of social networks to create change. That is, by taking bold actions and making personal sacrifices, activists would present a model to their communities and inspire friends and family members to reconsider their views on animals. However, while the pledge was meant to spark this process, in practice, it resulted more often than not in the disconnection of activists from their social networks. Instead of creating change by leveraging their personal relationships (the most important resource activists have, according to the social movement theory of change), the pledge weakened and sometimes even severed these relationships. I believe these problems were mostly a matter of inadequate training. Pledge-takers were sent to the front lines of a fiery struggle for social change (their family dinner table) with nothing but a template letter. In contrast, tactics that involved legal risk or personal safety were only encouraged with plenty of training. While the Pledge wasn’t a matter of life and death, freedom or prison, it was a risk to members’ closest and most important relationships. With 20/20 hindsight, it seems that it was unwise to encourage pledge-takers to risk these relationships with so little training. The Meaning of Nonviolence A lot of people might think of activism as characterized by righteous anger, held in an image of somebody yelling into a megaphone at a protest. But DxE understood that while anger has its place as an energizing and powerful force, the task of winning over hearts and minds is difficult, delicate, and requires extraordinary discipline over our own emotions.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge/","They might not have fully understood how much more difficult this is with our loved ones than with the public at large. The same advocate who can always treat hecklers at a protest with kindness might still be underprepared to treat their own family members with love and acceptance when the topic of animals comes up.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge/","The Alienating Aspects of the Framing Instrumentalizing Relationships Framing the Pledge as a political action instrumentalized our closest relationships, communicating to those closest to us that we thought of them as objects to be used for the cause. I Matter to You, but You Don’t Matter to Me By framing the Pledge as a pledge or oath, it was presented as a promise to people who weren’t present. Exasperated by the custom and direction to make a public statement before having private conversations with those affected, the Pledge had an unnecessary effect of communicating to our loved ones that they didn’t really matter to us, at least not in comparison to this new thing we were doing. By not including our loved ones in a decision that would greatly affect our future interactions, we communicated something that was often taken as profound disrespect. At the same time as it communicated that we didn’t particularly care about our loved ones, it explicitly appealed to their care for us, creating a heartbreaking competition about who loves the other less, and therefore gets the accommodation. Some of our loved ones must have felt that they’d be showing disproportionate care for us by agreeing to vegan tables, and so they attempted to call our bluff by serving meat. Of course, not every Pledge conversation went this way, and many included affirmations of how much the relationships meant to us. Some relationships truly were deepened by the pledge, but it seems that they were the exception. Unnecessary Escalation Even if you plan to hold a boundary around sitting at such a table, framing it as such in initial conversations is confrontational to an antisocial degree. Rather than inviting others to understand our experiences, the explicit focus on integrity (I wouldn’t sit if a dog were being eaten) unnecessarily created an adversarial dynamic.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge/","One Size Fits None By being all or nothing, the Pledge puts us in a position where we are de facto excluded from many large events or gatherings with people who don’t know us well. In these cases, it won’t  make sense to accommodate us by inconveniencing so many others, especially if our hosts don’t know us well.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge/","As It Lives Now In the early days of the Pledge, attendees at every DxE event were repeatedly encouraged to take it, in observance of its third tenant, toencourage others to do the same.Today, it is rarely discussed in public, probably due precisely to some of the harms I’ve described. While some people continue to practice it in some form, it seems that the political framing has largely dropped off. We understand that, while it didn’t take off as a political strategy, the practice of only sitting at vegan or vegetarian tables is important for our own mental health. Most people still practicing the Pledge (at least the ones I know) are dedicated animal activists who largely associate with other vegans. When we don’t, we might quietly suggest a vegan establishment and only inform our potential dining companions of the pledge when necessary. “The Pledge” still exists as shorthand for this habit, even when its third tenant and political framing are absent. While mostly inert, I believe that the Pledge continues to cause harm, albeit small harms compared to when it first came about. The Liberation Pledge Facebook Group remains somewhat active as a periodically updated illustration of the Pledge’s continuing effects. A recent post asks for advice for dealing with a mandatory school event, predicting that the writer will end up sitting alone in the corner throughout. To this person, it seems that the Pledge will prevent her from getting to know her classmates and thus prevent her from becoming a person whom they can know well enough to look to as an example. In addition, the poster’s relationship with the Pledge deprivesherof the chance to develop connections with others. A Better Way You may be thinking at this point that I’m encouraging everyone who has taken the Pledge to renounce it: that’s not where I’m going. In the next piece, I offer a proposal for rethinking the concept behind the Pledge to support the relationships and well-being of movement participants.","text",12

In particular, we sought to answer the following research question: what is the difference, if any, between the more common “consumer” frame messaging and our proposed “civic/evolve together” frame messaging in increasing participants’ support for the animal movement? Whereas the consumer frame encourages individual action, namely diet change, the civic/evolve together frame encourages collective action, primarily through voting and policy change. Three studies were conducted, each using surveys to gauge participant attitudes toward farmed animals and support for animal-friendly policies. The first study found that messages focused on exposing the deceptive practices of the animal agriculture industry (“humane deception”) were the most effective in garnering support for subsidizing meat alternatives. The second study explored the impact of message tones, themes, and frames and found that different message themes and frames can be more effective for different audiences, also finding the “humane deception” theme to be the most universally effective. The third study employed a longitudinal design to examine the long-term effects of different message frames on attitude change. Results suggest that both the consumer and evolve together frames can positively influence attitudes towards animals and support for animal-friendly policies, but the evolve together frame may be more effective at changing attitudes over time. This research provides valuable insights into the most effective message themes and frames for promoting support for animal-friendly policies and the animal movement and highlights the importance of tailoring messages to different audiences.","text",1

This should come as no surprise, as this is the frame the greater animal rights movement currently employs most commonly in its advocacy efforts toward the general public.","text",3
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/civic-vs-consumer-framing-survey-experiments-examining-their-impact-on-support-for-the-animal-freedom-movement/","The consumer frame, as we define it, calls on individuals to take action asconsumers;that is, it implores people to take personal responsibility for the global atrocities animals face daily by individually decreasing their meat consumption, buying more “humanely raised” products, or going vegan. However, we propose a new frame. The civic/evolve together frame, as we define it, underscores the importance of using our collective power as voters to make systemic change for farmed animals. It does not push for personal diet change, nor does it aim to make people feel personally responsible for fixing a deep-seated global problem. Indeed, it actively combats the feelings of powerlessness that often come with personal diet change and the futility that this ultimately brings to those sympathetic to the cause. Based on the results from our qualitative research,6Hamer, Eva, and Aidan Kankyoku. n.d. “Evolving Together.” Narrative.paxfauna.org. Pax Fauna. Accessed March 11, 2024. https://narrative.paxfauna.org/.which found that the evolve together frame was generally more effective than the consumer frame in garnering support for the animal movement and moving past a widely held belief in the futility of individual diet change, we sought to test how these findings would hold up to quantitative research. Overview of Studies Our first of three studies was primarily informed by our qualitative research, in which we ran focus groups and interviews to gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of various messages in garnering support for the animal movement. This study translated 20 of the messages that we had previously tested into op-ed form, which participants read and answered questions about. For the second study, we decided to focus more closely on the primary goal of our research: whether the consumer or evolve together frame worked better to influence public opinion regarding the animal movement.","text",4

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/civic-vs-consumer-framing-survey-experiments-examining-their-impact-on-support-for-the-animal-freedom-movement/","Our final study sought to expand upon our previous findings and further focus our efforts on our primary research question. To do this, we performed a multi-wave longitudinal study that measured the effectiveness of the evolve together/citizen frame compared to the more common consumer frame in positively shifting people’s views on animals and the animal freedom movement over time. Again, participants read differently-themed op-eds supporting a specific policy through separate frames before answering questions regarding their support for the policy and the greater animal movement once per week for 5 weeks. Study 1: Narrative Theme Survey Experiment Materials and Methods Participants We received 5,911 survey responses from participants recruited through Prolific, an online survey panel recruitment tool where participants were invited to participate in a 5-minute long “Narrative Survey” for $0.88. All participants were residents of the United States over the age of 18. After rejecting participants for the failure of two attention checks or otherwise returning their submissions, we were left with a total study population of 5606. Participants were either assigned to the control or one of 23 treatment groups, where the average number of participants per group was 267. The age of the average participant in our final participant pool was 38.23, while 49.4% identified as female and 50.6% identified as male. Procedure Participants were instructed to “read the following excerpt from a recent article regarding an upcoming ballot measure.” They were then shown either the control op-ed, an article about a wheat harvest, or one of 20 op-ed-type articles, all of which advocated for a ballot measure designed to protect animals and promote plant-based diets by subsidizing the cost of animal-free food alternatives. However, each treatment article centered around different themes, such as the deceptiveness of “humane” meat, health, and climate change.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/civic-vs-consumer-framing-survey-experiments-examining-their-impact-on-support-for-the-animal-freedom-movement/","While most messages were based on those that emerged from our qualitative research, some were included in an attempt to represent messages more commonly being used by advocates currently (as marked with an asterisk below). They were then asked a series of questions, answered on a 7-point Likert scale, and divided into three sections: policy support, messenger-likeability, and animal attitude. A short synopsis of each treatment op-ed is included below.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/civic-vs-consumer-framing-survey-experiments-examining-their-impact-on-support-for-the-animal-freedom-movement/","Fig. 1: Short synopsis of each treatment group’s corresponding op-ed. Dependent Variables We measured four dependent variables for all treatment groups. These included their policy support score, messenger-likeability score, animal attitude score, and the average of all three scores. Scores were measured using the aforementioned 7-point Likert scale. Analysis Post-hoc ANOVA tests were used to analyze our data via Jamovi, a free analysis tool similar to SPSS. We focused on comparing the average scores of each treatment group to the control specifically through p-value testing. We first analyzed the results of all participants in each treatment group, and then further divided each treatment and control group into three smaller groups, based on previously scored demographic questions answered by all participants which aimed to estimate how likely they would be to support our cause. These questions included intentions to decrease meat consumption, gender, and various political affiliations (see appendix for further information). We titled these groups ‘opposition’ (n = 618), ‘persuadable’ (n = 3696) and ‘base’ (n = 1292). Results Average Total Score All Participants The average total score among all participants was found to be significantly greater, including when accounting for the Bonferroni correction, than that of the control in the following treatment groups: Humane Deception (t(5585) = -4.1050, p < 0.001, pbonferroni= 0.009) and Health (t(5585)= -3.7124, p < 0.001, pbonferroni= 0.044).

Discussion Our results show that, across all participants, the humane deception-themed op-ed created the most positive change regarding participants’ support for a plant-based procurement policy and their general attitudes towards animals. The op-ed that detailed the health benefits of a plant-based diet closely followed. Other op-ed themes that often brought about statistically significant scoresbeforethe addition of the Bonferroni correction include consumer/voter (covert), better way, moral issue, and change of heart. For the persuadable segment of participants– the largest and arguably most important segmentation of our participants– the humane deception, stuck in place, and health-themed op-eds were generally the most effective in garnering support for this policy and of farmed animals more broadly. Our results also generally show that explicitly meat-eating messengers, or those who had been involved in animal agribusiness, were more “likable” and “relatable” to our participants. Among those in our opposition group, more progressive messengers such as climate change scientists were less likable and relatable, which makes sense given the group’s conservatism. While scores were overall higher for our base participants, indicating a higher level of support for the animal freedom movement, few statistically significant differences were detected between treatments. It may be that new information to people already familiar with and somewhat supportive of the animal movement has less of an impact on their beliefs, although the little difference found may also be due to the small sample size of our base participant pool. A similar phenomenon was seen within our opposition participant group. Their scores were generally low, and little difference was detected between treatment scores.","text",56
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/civic-vs-consumer-framing-survey-experiments-examining-their-impact-on-support-for-the-animal-freedom-movement/","In this case, it could also be that new information has little effect on those who are already so distrusting and unsupportive of the animal movement, or again, it could be that the sample size of our opposition participant population was too small to detect any meaningful differences between treatment groups.","text",57
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/civic-vs-consumer-framing-survey-experiments-examining-their-impact-on-support-for-the-animal-freedom-movement/","In some contexts, advocates may consider the persuadable segment to be the main target audience. For instance, while campaigns to promote diet change will find the earliest adopters among the base group, ballot measure campaigns are likely to be decided by persuadable voters. Some additional messages showed efficacy among the persuadable group, particularly the Stuck in Place message. Study 2: Framework Survey Experiment Materials and Methods For our second study, we sought to narrow down our research question to discover the difference, if any, between the more common consumer frame and our proposed civic/evolve together frame in increasing participants’ support for the animal movement. We additionally sought to test if the tone or subject of a message had any such effects. Finally, we included the main three veins of meat-reduction messaging– animal suffering, health, and climate change (focusing on humane deception for the animal suffering message because of its strong performance in the previous experiment)– to further compare these three common approaches. Participants Initially, 3463 U.S.-based participants over the age of 18 were recruited to participate in a 3-minute long “policy framework study” with an incentive of 60 cents. After disqualifying participants for failing attention checks, not providing consent, or otherwise returning their submissions, we were left with a study population of 3344 participants. The age of the average participant in our final participant pool was 34.15, while 47.76% identified as female, 49.37% identified as male, and 2.87% responded “other/prefer not to disclose.” Procedure Using a 3x2x2 factorial design, participants were randomly assigned to the control op-ed or one of 12 treatment op-eds, all of which were either: themed around climate change, health, or the deception of “humane” meat; used “dry” or “emotional” language; and were framed using the “consumer” or “evolve together/citizen” framework.","text",58

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/civic-vs-consumer-framing-survey-experiments-examining-their-impact-on-support-for-the-animal-freedom-movement/","All participants then answered a series of questions that measured their level of support for a ballot measure designed to “protect animals and promote plant-based diets by subsidizing the cost of animal-free food alternatives” and their attitudes towards farmed animal issues.","text",60

Dependent Variables We measured three dependent variables for all participant groups. These included their policy support score, animal attitude score, and the average of both scores. Scores were measured using a 7-point Likert scale. Analysis Similar to our previous study, we used Jamovi (an open-source, free data analysis tool similar to SPSS) to perform a factorial ANOVA analysis of our data, which additionally included post-hoc comparisons. We first analyzed the results of all participants in each treatment group, and then further broke each treatment and control group into three smaller groups, based on previously scored demographic questions answered by all participants which aimed to estimate how likely they would be to support our cause (see appendix for additional information). We titled these groups opposition (n =377), persuadable (n = 2069) and base (n = 890). Results Average Total Score All Participants Only the theme variable produced statistically significant differences between average total scores among all participants (at p = 0.015). Here, the humane deception theme performed significantly better than the health theme (t(3332)= 2.845, p = 0.004,  pbonferroni= 0.013), but its slightly higher score was not statistically significant from the climate change theme’s score. While the consumer frame and emotional tone performed just slightly better than their variable counterparts,  no other statistical significance was detected.","text",63

Discussion Our results show that, when comparing the consumer and evolve together frames directly, the consumer frame slightly, and occasionally significantly, was more effective in increasing support for animal-friendly policies and the animal movement as a whole. Interestingly, there seemed to be a toss-up between the dry and emotional tones. While the emotional tone proved to significantly increase the average policy support score among participants, the dry tone proved to significantly increase the average animal attitude score. The humane deception theme frequently produced statistically significantly greater scores than both the health and climate change themes. In some cases, however, the climate change theme was either equal to or outperformed the humane deception theme, particularly among those designated our base. The health theme was consistently the lowest-scoring theme. This experiment in particular demonstrates the importance of segmenting survey respondents into the sympathetic base, the antagonistic opposition, and the persuadable middle. Different strategies should target different segments (e.g. ballot measures will likely target persuadables while diet change efforts will target the base), and these segments exhibit meaningful differences in how they respond to messaging. Study 3: Longitudinal Framework Survey Experiment Materials and Methods For our final study, we sought to expand upon the findings of our second study while placing extra focus on our main research question– how effective is the civic/evolve together frame compared to the more conventional consumer frame in positively shifting people’s views on animals and the animal movement over time?","text",135
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/civic-vs-consumer-framing-survey-experiments-examining-their-impact-on-support-for-the-animal-freedom-movement/","Participants Initially, 1500 participants were recruited at random to take part in our four-minute, five-week long study (titled “Longitudinal 5-Part Policy Study, Part 1” with a weekly incentive of $0.80) via Prolific.co, an online survey panel recruitment tool. All participants were United States residents over the age of 18 who had not participated in any of our previous studies. After rejecting participants for failing attention checks or otherwise returning their submissions, our baseline population was 1406 participants, randomly assigned to the control (n = 269) or one of two treatment groups: evolve together frame (n = 267) or consumer frame (n = 269). Wave 1 saw 1231 returning participants, ending with an attrition rate of 12.4%. Wave 2 saw 1059 returning participants, translating to an attrition rate of 14% between waves 1 and 2. Wave 3 saw 920 returning participants with an attrition rate of 13.1% between waves 2 and 3. With wave 4, our final total number of participants (the responses of whom were used for our analysis), came to 805. This results in an attrition rate of 12.5% between waves 3 and 4, and anoverallattrition rate of 42.7%.","text",136

Procedure The initial wave sought to gather baseline data regarding participants’ various beliefs regarding animals used for food, their intentions to reduce meat consumption, and their support for a hypothetical plant-based procurement policy. During waves 1 through 4, participants in all three groups were presented with op-ed type articles all written around a central theme, but with unique framing for both treatment groups (being the consumer frame or evolve together frame). The themes for each week were as follows: wave 1 detailed industry deception, wave 2 discussed health impacts, wave 3 examined climate change, and wave 4 summarized all arguments made in previous weeks. The control group read op-eds regarding walking and biking in favor of driving, while the consumer frame treatment group’s op-eds urged readers to reduce their meat consumption or “go vegan” while the evolve together frame urged readers to vote in favor of a generic animal-related policy. They were then presented with the same questions asked during the baseline wave, separated into three sections, and answered on a 7-point Likert scale. Dependent Variables We measured four dependent variables for all participant groups. These included their policy support score, meat reduction score, movement support score, as well as the average of all three scores. Analysis We used the Jamovi (an open-sourced, free data analysis tool similar to SPSS) package “gamlj” to perform a mixed-model analysis of our data. This included fixed, random, and simple effects tests and estimates as well as post-hoc comparisons.","text",137

Discussion Our results show that while both the consumer and evolve together frames can have a positive impact on the general population’s support for public plant-based food procurement policies and the animal-freedom movement as a whole, the evolve together frame slightly but consistently outperforms the consumer frame, particularly among those whose demographics make it more likely for them to be persuaded toward supporting our cause. Willingness to reduce meat consumption was somewhat resistant to both frames among all participants, however. It may be that this practice is so deeply ingrained in our society that either frame is simply ineffective in changing this behavior. Interestingly, while we did not expect scores for the control group to increase (often significantly but to a lesser degree than the treatment groups) over the course of the study as they did, this may indicate that repeated exposure to pro-animal policies alone may be enough to slightly increase their popularity among voters. Keeping in mind the small sample sizes of both the opposition and base pools of participants, we caution against more widely applying the results specific to these small groups of participants. General Discussion Across all studies, participants were shown op-eds in support of a particular pro-animal ballot measure and were then surveyed to gauge their level of support for said measures, in addition to the animal movement as a whole. The first study examined messages with different subject matter, and generally found that focusing on how deceptive the animal agriculture industry is, specifically the lies they tell about the welfare of the animals they exploit, was the most effective at garnering support for a meat-alternative subsidy and the animal movement among all participants. These results were statistically significant among our total sample, as well as our “persuadable” sample.","text",187
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/civic-vs-consumer-framing-survey-experiments-examining-their-impact-on-support-for-the-animal-freedom-movement/","Our second study placed more emphasis on our main research question, with the addition of looking at how different “tones” of messages alter their effectiveness. This study found little statistical significance between all comparisons, but did find that the consumer frame significantly increased our total sample’s animal attitude score, in addition to our “opposition” sample’s average total score, policy support score, and animal attitude score. In regard to our “tone” findings, the results appeared to be mixed. For example, while the total sample’s policy support score was significantly strengthened by the emotional tone, the total sample’s animal attitude score was significantly strengthened by the dry tone. In line with our first study, the humane deception theme frequently performed significantly better than other frames including our total sample’s average total and animal attitude scores, all scores among our  “persuadable” sample. However, the climate change theme performed significantly better than other themes for our “base” sample’s average total and policy support scores.","text",188
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/civic-vs-consumer-framing-survey-experiments-examining-their-impact-on-support-for-the-animal-freedom-movement/","Our third study expanded upon the method and findings of our second while focusing even further on our core research question and taking place over the course of five weeks. This longitudinal design was employed to see if people’s attitudes towards animals and animal-friendly policies change over time, as opposed to just measuring these attitudes at one snapshot in time. These results contrasted with those of the previous studies and showed that, over time, both the evolve together and consumer frames are effective in changing participant attitudes when compared to the control group. However, the evolve together frame more frequently produced statistically significant score increases when compared to the control group. It should be noted that little statistical significance was found when comparing the scores of both frames directly and that the evolve together frame treatment group’s baseline scores started generally (and non-significantly) higher than both the control and consumer frame treatment groups. Keeping these combined results in mind, it may be that both the consumer and evolve together frame positively influence people’s attitudes towards animals and their support of animal-friendly policies. However, given our longitudinal study’s results, it may be that the civic frame is slightly more effective at changing attitudes over time, and perhaps helping these attitudes “stick” more than the consumer frame. Additionally, given higher exposure to the more common consumer frame, it may be that this frame is easier to “activate” with a single intervention, whereas the less common civic frame requires more time to be “learned” and may actually be more effective overall.","text",189

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/civic-vs-consumer-framing-survey-experiments-examining-their-impact-on-support-for-the-animal-freedom-movement/","Finally, our results show the importance of shifting message themes depending on the audience. For example, messages with a climate change theme were not as effective in shifting the attitudes of conservative participants, while messages with a “humane deception” theme were generally effective among a wider variety of participants. Because our analysis of the “tone” of messages returned little statistical significance, more research is needed to make any conclusions regarding message tone here. Limitations and Future Directions First, this research relied on self-generated survey questions partially informed by the Animal Attitude Scale (Herzog, Betchart & Pittman, 1991). However, few empirically evaluated survey questions and/or scales for measuring attitudes towards farmed animals and pro-animal policies were found prior to designing our studies. Of course, our questions (as is the case with most surveys) were self-report measures which come with their own controversy and potential for error. However, some measures were put in place to limit the potential for social desirability bias within our surveys. Additionally, our  “opposition,” “persuadable,” and “base,” subset of our samples from each study were small and did not have the power necessary to apply their results more widely. Future studies would do well to ensure sufficient subject populations for all sample subsets. Additionally, a longer-term longitudinal study would help the movement gain more data on how effective different messaging frames are in garnering long-term, unwavering support for pro-animal policies. Finally, the creation of an empirically evaluated farmed animal attitude scale and animal policy support scale would be valuable to a wide range of studies, not just those looking to expand upon our present research.","text",191
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/civic-vs-consumer-framing-survey-experiments-examining-their-impact-on-support-for-the-animal-freedom-movement/","Future research on animal advocacy messaging may also benefit from using our model for segmenting base, persuadable, and opposition subgroups, which revealed important insights about message efficacy that would not have been apparent otherwise. Further research could iterate on this segmentation model to develop a more effective version.","text",192
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/civic-vs-consumer-framing-survey-experiments-examining-their-impact-on-support-for-the-animal-freedom-movement/","Conclusion In conclusion, our research has shown that messages with a focus on exposing the deceptive practices of the animal agriculture industry are generally the most effective in garnering support for plant-based procurement policies and the animal movement. However, our results also indicate that different message themes and frames may be more effective for different audiences. Specifically, messages with a climate change theme were not as effective in shifting attitudes among conservative participants, while messages with a “humane deception” theme were generally effective across a wide range of participants. Our longitudinal study further suggests that both the consumer and evolve together frames can positively influence attitudes towards animals and support for animal-friendly policies, but the evolve together frame may be slightly more effective at changing attitudes over time. Nonetheless, more research is needed to draw firm conclusions on this topic. In summary, our research provides valuable insights into the most effective message themes and frames for promoting support for animal-friendly policies and the animal movement. By taking into account the differences in audience preferences, we can create more effective and targeted messages that can ultimately help shift attitudes regarding our use of animals.

"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-networks-movements/","Part 3 ofIt’s Social Norms, Stupid This is the last in a series of three articles. Inpart one, I made the case that the farmed animal movement’s dominant theory of change is neglecting the role of social norms in shaping people’s attachment to meat, resulting in insufficient strategies. Inpart two, I introduced the science of social networks, which has cast new light on how changes in norms spread. Now, I build on this science to discuss how social movements can unleash the power of social networks to change norms at scale, particularly for the animal freedom movement. In fact, I believe this is precisely where social movement strategies excel. If you don’t know what I mean by “social movement strategies,” you’re in the right place. The Gist Norms, Networks, Movements Social norms are one of themost powerful forcesthat keeps people eating animals. Most people are surrounded by other people eating animals. These connections make it socially costly for them to change, a cost most people are unwilling to bear no matter how hard we try to persuade them. As a result, individual diet change advocacy has been extremely limited in its reach, and per capita meat consumptioncontinues to rise. This seemingly insurmountable challenge has led many animal advocacy organizations to shift their attention away from the general public completely. Organizations like The Humane League and Mercy for Animals, which used to invest heavily in leafleting and vegan outreach, now prefer corporate welfare campaigns. These campaigns may help to address one hurdle (the relative cost of animal vs. non-animal meat) by driving up the price of animal products. Butif we ever want to end the use of animals for food, we will most likely need to engage with social norms directly. But there is good news: new research has illuminated the process by which changes in social norms spread.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-networks-movements/","This research, helpfully summarized by network scientist Damon Centola in his bookChange,suggests that with the right strategy, social networks could be flipped from our greatest obstacle to ourmost powerful tool. Counterintuitively, by focusing on social clusters on the margins of society’s relational networks, we can build momentum for a new norm, growing like a snowball until it can take over society.","text",5

"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-networks-movements/","In part 2 of this series, we imagined how thisSnowball Strategycould be used to spread a new norm through the network pictured above. Starting on the periphery, just two individuals would be enough to create a small bubble where the new norm reached majority status. From there, it could spread slowly through the periphery and build momentum before ever coming up against the full force of the previous norm. That’s all well enough for a simple diagram. But an entire nation? U.S. society is an endlessly complicated social network of clusters within clusters within clusters deeply and mysteriously intertwined, with central nodes (influencers) on all different scales. What does this really look like at the societal level, in practice? That question is the subject of this third and final article. For me, the most exciting thing about this new research on social networks is its potential to answer a question that has confounded sociologists for decades: how do social movements create change?Most sociologists agree that social movements (and protest movements in particular) often play an important role in major social and cultural transformations, but there is far less agreement on how.Centola’s research points towards the most compelling answer I have seen. I now feel more confident than ever that social movement strategies are the key to unlocking the power of social networks at scale, and conversely, that the new research on social networks teaches us how to design movements that are most likely to change norms. First, what exactly do we mean by social movements? Culture on the Move In the summer of 2020, the Black Lives Matter movement blossomed into the largest protest movement in U.S. history.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-networks-movements/","This wave of protest was highly decentralized and had elements of spontaneity, but it was also a direct product of years of hard work by BLM organizers and campaigners across the country, especially in the Southeast (not to mention decades of organizing dating back even before the Civil Rights era). From 2013 onward, these organizers had toiled in the background, building a common narrative and preparing communities to mobilize rapidly in response to murders by police. These repeated mobilizations especially from 2014-2016 normalized the idea of mass street demonstrations in response to police violence and helped spread BLM’s message.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-networks-movements/","The mainstream media mostly stuck to the dominant narrative, describing the victims as “suspected criminals” and the movement as “riotous mobs.” But on the periphery, a counter-narrative was building momentum, a story of long-oppressed communities refusing to stay silent as power-drunk police officers murder Black teens. The Black Lives Matter narrative snowballed through urban Black communities, as well as clusters on the political left such as college campuses and alternative media, slowly building up the momentum necessary to challenge the dominant narrative (Centola documents this spread inChangeusing Twitter data). Cycles of grassroots organizing often last foronly a few years, and by the end of 2017, much of this original organizing energy had fizzled out. The number of protests by active BLM chapters dropped sharply. But by this time, the narrative had taken on a life of its own.The snowball kept building, invisible to the mainstream and even to most activists, until it finally exploded into view with the murder of George Floyd. Tens of thousands of protesters poured into the streets in a tsunami of moral outrage. Unlike the protests of 2014-16, these extraordinary mobilizations were to a large extent spontaneous and leaderless. It was a messy process, but eventually the movement coalesced behind a clear political demand: defunding police departments. While it sounded shocking on its face, protesters backed this demand up with a serious plan, to redirect funding towards other forms of public safety, including housing and employment programs meant to target the root causes of many crimes. Throughout the summer, “defund the police” was the unmistakable rallying cry. To make a long story short, this demanddid not come to pass. A few cities passed bills to redirect some funding away from police departments only to quickly reverse course. The idea of reducing police department funding hasreceded back to the political fringe.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-networks-movements/","An observer might look at this and conclude that the Black Lives Matter movement was largely a flop. They’d be entirely missing the point.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-networks-movements/","Outside Game For our purposes right now, let's define social movements as: To simplify that a bit, we could think of social movements as change initiatives driven primarily by large numbers of volunteers working outside the system, as opposed to politicians or NGOs working inside of it. However, while some change initiatives renounce the status quo completely and seek to build independent alternative systems, social movements buildpoweroutside the dominant system for the purpose of directly challenging it. For this reason,social movements are sometimes called theoutside gamestrategy, paired with theinside gamestrategies of lobbying, building relationships with policymakers, or or seeking office inside dominant institutions. When we think of it that way, it makes sense that outside game strategies often aren’t the best way to get a specific policy passed, at least not directly. Besides Black Lives Matter, another recent example is Extinction Rebellion (XR) in the UK. In 2019, XR catalyzed the largest mass civil disobedience (and corresponding mass arrests) in Britain in decades, perhaps ever, with thousands of Brits deliberately getting themselves arrested to protest the government’s inaction on climate change. Yet besides the empty gesture of national and local governments formally declaring a “climate emergency,” none of XR’s concrete demands were enacted. If social movements don’t change laws, what are they good for? We need only take a step back to see the profound effect each of these movements had on their surroundings. XR transformed the way the British public and media talk about the climate crisis, leading to a sharp, persistentincrease in public concern.

"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-networks-movements/","The Missing Link Social movements excel not in directly changing policies, but inchanging narratives.If ordinary politics are a game of tug-of-war, mass protest movements transform the entire landscape the game is being played on, making the previously unimaginable seem inevitable or at least feasible.In a healthy movement ecology, theoutside gamestrategies work to shift the landscape in favor of an issue, opening up new space forinside gameplayers to secure more ambitious policy changes than would otherwise be possible.(Think of theOverton Windowif you’re familiar with it.) In other words, social movements change political norms. But how? For a long time, researchers and social scientists have been divided. Is news coverage of dramatic confrontations between protesters and police uniquely effective for persuading the public to support a cause? Are powerful decision makers afraid of what would happen if the protests keep growing? Or is there something else going on, something below the surface? If we understood what mechanism social movements use to create this change, we’d know how to design the most effective movement for transforming social norms around eating animals. Before explicitly hearing of the science of social networks, I was aware of a different theory explaining how movements create change, associated with the work of social movement scholar Doug McAdam.According to the Proximity Theory, the main power of social movements lies not in press coverage or in the righteous fear of the powerful, but in the creation of activists. Essentially,protest movements work by drawing in huge numbers of people who were already sympathetic to the cause but had not yet been activated.Through shared experiences of transgressing social norms (as is done in a mass protest), their identity is transformed. The movement becomes a core part of who they are, and they unite behind its shared narrative.","text",16
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-networks-movements/","Yet therealwork of social change happens not during the protest, but afterwards, when these people return to their preexisting social networks as passionate evangelists, turning the gears of change one conversation at a time.","text",17
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-networks-movements/","Well, so the theory goes, anyway. But I’ve always found Proximity Theory challenging. On one hand, it seems to fit with other things we know about social movements. For instance, social movements are more likely to succeed if they have more people. That might seem obvious, but why? A 500 person protest and a 5,000 person protest aren’t actually all that different in their capacity to disrupt a city and garner media coverage, especially if the smaller protest is more willing to risk arrest. But if protest movements work by transforming latent supporters into activists who then make change by persuading their friends and family, that would explain why the number of activists a movement can create is so crucial. Another predictor of social movement efficacy isnarrative unity:is everyone in the movement singing the same tune? Organized protest can be a highly effective way to let both supporters and opponents know what the narrativeis,even if it doesn’t change minds right away. But could Proximity Theory really explain the mechanism by which protest movements could change norms in a nation ofhundreds of millions of people? One conversation at a time? In my early years in the animal rights movement, I remember riding the bus home from protests in Denver, gazing out the window as we zipped past miles and miles of suburban developments, contemplating the enormity of individual humans just in this one small corner of one country. How were we ever supposed to build a movement that could actually reach inside hundreds of millions of minds and change their views about nonhuman life? On some level, it just didn’t seem realistic to me. Until, that is, I learned of the Snowball Strategy and the research behind it. Social network science didn’t cause me to massively rethink my belief in the value of social movement strategies. Instead, it provided a missing link to help me fit different ideas together.","text",18
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-networks-movements/","In fact, the two theories are remarkably compatible, with network science providing a window inside processes that social movement theories treat as a mystery.The new science of how change spreads through social networks explains the norm-transforming chain reaction set off by social movements,while social movements provide the ideal catalyst for the Snowball Strategy to be implemented on a massive scale.","text",19
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-networks-movements/","We Go Together Like… Consider the animal movement. Conservatively, there are right now at least a million (perhaps several million) ethically motivated vegetarian and vegan adults sprinkled across U.S. society.1Of 258.3 million adults in the U.S., conservatively 5% (13 million) are vegetarian, 5% being near the low end of the very wide spread of survey results on the topic. 10% is a very conservative offer of the number of vegetarians strongly motivated by animal rights.These people care deeply enough about the suffering of animals to break the norm of eating them, but hardly anyone else around them does. Even on the periphery, they feel they’re too small of a minority. Many of them stay silent on the issue of animal freedom, because they’ve learned that speaking up has a high social cost. Perhaps they even insist that other people’s meat eating doesn’t bother them, potentially reinforcing the normality of eating animals just to avoid being seen as the pushy, annoying vegetarian. These isolated vegetarians represent enormous potential for the animal movement. To borrow a term from legendary behavioral economist Cass Sunstein, they arenorm breakers,“those who simply depart from the existing norms.”The challenge is to transform them intonorm entrepreneurs, “who oppose existing norms and try to change them.”InHow Change Happens,Sunstein explains how crucial this transformation is for catalyzing change in norms. If even a fraction of these people could be transformed, they would comprise an enormous army of antispeciesist evangelists hundreds of thousands strong, an enviable goal for any social movement. You understand by now that the key to this transformation is social networks. As long as they remain isolated, it is extremely difficult to turn norm breakers into norm entrepreneurs. And even if they can be transformed, they likely won’t be very effective.","text",20
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-networks-movements/","If you drop one lone evangelist into a social group with a deeply entrenched norm, it is rare that they will convert even one person. It only becomes more unlikely if that norm is dominant in the society surrounding them. Overcoming this resistancepresents an enormous challenge. Most evangelists will fail or even be converted back into the dominant norm.","text",21
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-networks-movements/","Butif you can connect these people together, you can create a bubble where norm entrepreneurshipisthe norm.You can give people the confidence to speak out, and start building a snowball. Social Crystallization Well, connecting and activating norm breakers is the name of the game in social movements. The precise thing that sets social movement organizations (SMOs) apart from inside-game organizations is that their strategy depends entirely on turning out large numbers of volunteer activists. Whereas a small, well-funded professional organization can successfully lobby for a piece of legislation or campaign for a company to change their animal welfare policies,SMOs build their theory of change around mass participation. SMOs need to turn out thousands or tens of thousands of activists. But most of the time, those activists don’t yet exist. So the day-to-day life of a social movement organizer is all about creating them, by finding latent norm breakers and transforming them into norm entrepreneurs. At Pax Fauna, we are proponents of a specific set of social movement strategies called Momentum-Driven Organizing (outlined inThis Is an Uprisingby Mark and Paul Engler, one of my top two books on social change alongsideChange). Momentum-Driven Organizing is built on a rich history, but the core idea is simple enough: create a cycle of escalating confrontation with the status quo to attract more and more passive supporters into the movement, absorbing them into a well-organized SMO where they can be transformed into a dedicated activist.","text",22

"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-networks-movements/","It’s no coincidence the Momentum-Driven Organizing and the Snowball Strategy are both named after momentum.(For those who count something other than English as your first language, “snowballing” is a common metaphor for building momentum, because of the way a snowball rolling down a hill gets larger and larger.) I don’t mean to say that the two theories were developed in tandem; as far as I know, they are just becoming aware of each other. But they are wonderfully compatible because both have tapped into an essential truth about how cultural change spreads. Momentum-driven SMOs believe that mass-producing activist transformations for people is one of their core measures of success (though not the only one). It turns out that confrontational protests are a great way to do this.It’s hard to imagine a better place to form anorm entrepreneurialidentity than shoulder to shoulder with hundreds of other activists,facing down a police line, chanting in unison, spiritually high on shared purpose and solidarity. But momentum organizing doesn’t just use mass protest. It also seeks to absorb people into a volunteer organization, a network of strong social ties where the new norm can be reinforced. At their best, it’s easy to see how social movement organizations could function as the initial clusters of strong ties on the network periphery through which new norms can spread and build momentum, while at the same time spreadingawarenessof the issue through media coverage of protests, thus priming the ground for dramatic cultural transformation when the tipping point is reached. It’s Social, Stupid Speaking of things that aren’t a coincidence, I’ve been grasping this whole time for some clever trick to play with the common word insocial norms, social networks,andsocial movements.Alas, I wasn’t able to come up with anything, so this humorless conclusion will have to do.","text",25

"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-networks-movements/","The TPC postulate focuses on the single relationship between consumers and their food provider, imagining that all the problems of animal-free meat adoption can be addressed there. That’s not how people work. We are social, and anything a tenth as fundamental and controversial as food is processed through our social selves. The price and chemistry of alternative meats may have an important role to play, but ultimately, the matter of animal freedom will be settled in the social arena. Fortunately, we have a wealth of research and tools to guide us in that arena, if we know where to look. For organizations focused on levers other than public opinion, keep doing what you’re doing. But to the extent you’re trying to build support or behavior change among the general public, social clusters and the snowball strategy should be at the heart of your planning. And for leaders or funders who can shape what programs the movement undertakes,we need to reengage with social norms on a much larger scale.We need a renaissance of advocacy aimed at the public. Social movement strategies should be a major part of that. Pax Fauna exists to reinvigorate the social movement sector of the animal freedom ecology, but we have no delusion that we can do it alone. If you resonate with the ideas shared in this series, you canreach outto get plugged into our work on a volunteer or full-time basis. Or if you’re already involved in a project that could use (or is using) some of these strategies,get in touchso we can compare notes and build power together. We’d love for you to join the conversation about how we can incorporate the Snowball Strategy more deeply into our strategies.If we’re going to focus on social connections, the ones within our movement are a great place to start!

"https://paxfauna.org/blog/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge","An icon of fork bracelet inscribed with “The Liberation Pledge” The Failure of the Pledge and a Better Way Towards Vegan Tables In 2015, animal advocates with Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) launched an inspired new campaign among their members. It took courage, required sacrifice, and greatly backfired. This three-part series examines what the movement learned from the Liberation Pledge, how we might energize the intention behind the Pledge in a better way, and a piece to share with friends and family to do just that. What We Learned From the Liberation Pledge How It Started The Liberation Pledge was a fascinating idea and a bit of a disaster. Instead of energizing supporters’ social networks to create change, as its creators intended, it often had the opposite effect- to isolate advocates from their closest relationships. In this piece, you’ll learn The next piece in this series suggests a better way to energize the intention behind the pledge, for animal advocates to align their actions with their values in their personal relationships. The Liberation Pledge was a three-part public pledge to Enthusiasts of the pledge hoped it would create acultural stigmaaround eating animals similar to the stigma that has developed around smoking over recent decades. That is, even while smoking is still practiced, it is prohibited by default in public and private spaces. Before we had the Pledge, many of us felt alienated from friends and family who continued to eat animals. We were forced to choose between two options: speaking up and risking being seen as obnoxious, angry, and argumentative, or keeping the peace with painful inauthenticity, swallowing our intense discomfort at watching our loved ones eat the bodies of animals. The pledge gave us hope that there was another way: being honest with those around us while continuing to spend time with them.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge","And, on a larger scale, we hoped that if we all joined together, we could create a world where eating meat is stigmatized: a world where someone would ask, “Does anyone mind if I get the steak?” before making an order at a restaurant (or maybe even one in which restaurants would think twice before putting someone’s body on the menu).","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge","Some people took it a step further, arguing it was immoralnotto take the pledge, saying, “You wouldn’t sit quietly eating your vegan option while a dog or a child was being eaten, would you?” According to this view, it was our duty not to sit idly by while violence was committed in our presence. While some beautiful and inspiring stories were detailed on a Facebook group for the Pledge, it seemed to me that there were many more instances of total disaster: people experiencing huge ruptures in their oldest relationships around the Pledge while often lamenting that those they had just discarded  “care more about eating dead animals than they care about me.” From where I stood, the biggest effect of the Pledge was for advocates to lose relationships with family members who didn’t comply. Upon taking the Pledge, a close friend at the time experienced a years-long estrangement from their family,including those who were already veganwhile many others decided to skip birthdays, weddings, and holidays with family. It’s possible that all of this added stigma around eating animals. With these relationships broken down, we don’t know. My Liberation Pledge I believe the pledge was so popular because it politicized something that we desperately wanted for our own comfort–no animals on the table while we were there–and I took it pretty much as soon as it launched. The Pledge certainly contributed to my alienation from nonvegans, though I neither experienced the best nor the worst of it. My immediate family accommodated a request for vegetarian tables at holiday dinners, but I’m sure that there were many invitations I would have received if not for it. While my overall immersion in the animal rights community during that time certainly deserves some of the credit for the fact that I didn’t develop many new relationships with nonvegans during the following several years, the effect of the Pledge can’t be discounted.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge","A website was created with advice for taking the pledge, which is still online as of this writing. It suggested that pledge-takers write a public statement (a model announcement is provided) to inform their friends and family about their new commitment. It also offered some logistical suggestions for getting together with friends and family who aren’t willing to cooperate with the rules of the Pledge. Most importantly, it laid out the reasoning for why we must, together, participate in the Liberation Pledge (to stigmatize eating animals) and directs the reader to “stay firm and nonviolent in the face of conflict.”","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge","This was the right kind of advice, but it fell far short. With the benefit of hindsight, we can say that the founders of the Liberation Pledge underestimated just how difficult an undertaking they were proposing.In fact, the pledge in practice often had the opposite of its intended effect, an outcome that profoundly undermined DxE’s central theory of change.DxE believed in the power of social networks to create change. That is, by taking bold actions and making personal sacrifices, activists would present a model to their communities and inspire friends and family members to reconsider their views on animals. However, while the pledge was meant to spark this process, in practice, it resulted more often than not in the disconnection of activists from their social networks. Instead of creating change by leveraging their personal relationships (the most important resource activists have, according to the social movement theory of change), the pledge weakened and sometimes even severed these relationships. I believe these problems were mostly a matter of inadequate training. Pledge-takers were sent to the front lines of a fiery struggle for social change (their family dinner table) with nothing but a template letter. In contrast, tactics that involved legal risk or personal safety were only encouraged with plenty of training. While the Pledge wasn’t a matter of life and death, freedom or prison, it was a risk to members’ closest and most important relationships. With 20/20 hindsight, it seems that it was unwise to encourage pledge-takers to risk these relationships with so little training. The Meaning of Nonviolence A lot of people might think of activism as characterized by righteous anger, held in an image of somebody yelling into a megaphone at a protest. But DxE understood that while anger has its place as an energizing and powerful force, the task of winning over hearts and minds is difficult, delicate, and requires extraordinary discipline over our own emotions.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge","They might not have fully understood how much more difficult this is with our loved ones than with the public at large. The same advocate who can always treat hecklers at a protest with kindness might still be underprepared to treat their own family members with love and acceptance when the topic of animals comes up.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge","The Alienating Aspects of the Framing Instrumentalizing Relationships Framing the Pledge as a political action instrumentalized our closest relationships, communicating to those closest to us that we thought of them as objects to be used for the cause. I Matter to You, but You Don’t Matter to Me By framing the Pledge as a pledge or oath, it was presented as a promise to people who weren’t present. Exasperated by the custom and direction to make a public statement before having private conversations with those affected, the Pledge had an unnecessary effect of communicating to our loved ones that they didn’t really matter to us, at least not in comparison to this new thing we were doing. By not including our loved ones in a decision that would greatly affect our future interactions, we communicated something that was often taken as profound disrespect. At the same time as it communicated that we didn’t particularly care about our loved ones, it explicitly appealed to their care for us, creating a heartbreaking competition about who loves the other less, and therefore gets the accommodation. Some of our loved ones must have felt that they’d be showing disproportionate care for us by agreeing to vegan tables, and so they attempted to call our bluff by serving meat. Of course, not every Pledge conversation went this way, and many included affirmations of how much the relationships meant to us. Some relationships truly were deepened by the pledge, but it seems that they were the exception. Unnecessary Escalation Even if you plan to hold a boundary around sitting at such a table, framing it as such in initial conversations is confrontational to an antisocial degree. Rather than inviting others to understand our experiences, the explicit focus on integrity (I wouldn’t sit if a dog were being eaten) unnecessarily created an adversarial dynamic.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge","One Size Fits None By being all or nothing, the Pledge puts us in a position where we are de facto excluded from many large events or gatherings with people who don’t know us well. In these cases, it won’t  make sense to accommodate us by inconveniencing so many others, especially if our hosts don’t know us well.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge","As It Lives Now In the early days of the Pledge, attendees at every DxE event were repeatedly encouraged to take it, in observance of its third tenant, toencourage others to do the same.Today, it is rarely discussed in public, probably due precisely to some of the harms I’ve described. While some people continue to practice it in some form, it seems that the political framing has largely dropped off. We understand that, while it didn’t take off as a political strategy, the practice of only sitting at vegan or vegetarian tables is important for our own mental health. Most people still practicing the Pledge (at least the ones I know) are dedicated animal activists who largely associate with other vegans. When we don’t, we might quietly suggest a vegan establishment and only inform our potential dining companions of the pledge when necessary. “The Pledge” still exists as shorthand for this habit, even when its third tenant and political framing are absent. While mostly inert, I believe that the Pledge continues to cause harm, albeit small harms compared to when it first came about. The Liberation Pledge Facebook Group remains somewhat active as a periodically updated illustration of the Pledge’s continuing effects. A recent post asks for advice for dealing with a mandatory school event, predicting that the writer will end up sitting alone in the corner throughout. To this person, it seems that the Pledge will prevent her from getting to know her classmates and thus prevent her from becoming a person whom they can know well enough to look to as an example. In addition, the poster’s relationship with the Pledge deprivesherof the chance to develop connections with others. A Better Way You may be thinking at this point that I’m encouraging everyone who has taken the Pledge to renounce it: that’s not where I’m going. In the next piece, I offer a proposal for rethinking the concept behind the Pledge to support the relationships and well-being of movement participants.","text",12

"https://paxfauna.org/empathy-with-our-opposition-persuading-through-nonviolent-communication/","This blog is the final one in a series meant to put the content of Eva’s NVC trainings online into a readable format. If you missed them, here are previous blogs in this series. Part One:why we study nonviolence Part Two: thepractice of empathy Part Three: the building blocks of empathy,feelings and needs Part Four:observations and requests Part Five:beginning a practice in NVC Part Six:when enemies appear Part Seven:the movement needs a repair kit Part Eight:What Anti-Vegan bias can teach us about allyship The Gist: At Pax Fauna, we've undertaken extensive research to unearth best practices in messaging and develop resources for our movement's culture, tactics, and strategy. During this journey, one theme that emerged is the power of empathy. While we’ve written about this in ournarrative reports, this blog will explore empathy as a tool for persuasion from a Nonviolent Communication lens. Empathy: A Vehicle for Transformation A vital assumption in Nonviolent Communication is that every single action a person takes is their way of trying to meet a fundamental need. When we embrace this perspective, even when we vehemently disagree with someone's actions, we can still empathize and establish a connection. Dismissing individuals as fundamentally unreasonable or unlike us cuts off our ability to connect and in doing so, severs a potential path for transformation. So, how do we start? It's tough to listen if you haven't been heard, and that's where aself-empathy practicelike I’ve written about before comes in. Begin by connecting with your own feelings and needs before you turn your attention to others. Once you've done this self-work, you're better equipped to offer empathy to those who hold opposing views. A self-empathy practice can also be usefulaftera difficult conversation.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/empathy-with-our-opposition-persuading-through-nonviolent-communication/","Empathy as Persuasion When we encounter common rationalizations from the public, such as culture, tradition, or natural arguments for consuming animal products, it's tempting to dismiss these as misguided. However, empathy can be an important strategy for overcoming defensiveness and opening up lines of communication.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/empathy-with-our-opposition-persuading-through-nonviolent-communication/","Instead of immediately diving into a rebuttal, try asking questions that help you understand the values underpinning their objections. There's a good chance you'll find values you share. Affirming the importance of these values can demonstrate that we are regular citizens who stand on common ground. And sometimes, giving empathy for the underlying values can lead individuals to question their own rationalizations. Turning Objections into Openings You may have encountered a lot of advice about how to counter objections to animal rights. This advice often includes impressive statistics and talking points that are sure to stump the average meat eater. However, I’d like to offer some skepticism about whether counterarguing, alone, is the most effective way to create change. Our research found that when study participants were given empathy for their objections—even without offering any counterarguments—they shifted quite strongly in the direction of the movement’s goals. For example, one participant argued that eating meat was important to culture. After being shown empathy for this concern, that same participant said, “Animals need somebody to stand up and say, ""This isn't right."" And we have other alternatives now. Now similar to the child labor movement… it was easy to use children to do labor, it's easy to use animals for food, but is either one really right?” Let's explore some common objections and what empathy might sound like in response. Objection: I don't know if plant-based options are actually that healthy. I tried going vegetarian once and felt weak. Response: It sounds like you want to be sure that you and others can be healthy and well-nourished. Is that it? Objection: Animal agriculture is big in Colorado. It's been a way of life for generations of farmers. And what about the workers employed in slaughterhouses or fur shops?","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/empathy-with-our-opposition-persuading-through-nonviolent-communication/","Response: Of course, I hear the concern about all the people who have depended on these industries for their livelihoods for generations. It sounds like you really want everyone to have a safe, fulfilling job, am I getting it?","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/empathy-with-our-opposition-persuading-through-nonviolent-communication/","Objection: Whether I eat meat or wear fur is my personal choice that no one should interfere with. I'm not stopping anyone from going animal-free, so how is it fair for you to tell me I have to? Response: I can tell how important that sense of personal choice is.Of course,you don’t want anyone telling you what to buy, wear, or eat. Am I hearing your concern? Objection: I was raised on meat or farming/hunting animals. Meat and fur are important to cultural traditions, including those of my family or of immigrant or Indigenous communities. They're necessary in some places. Response: Definitely, meat and fur have played a significant role in these traditions. It's often felt like there was no other choice for people to sustain themselves, stay warm, and uphold their customs. Am I understanding your perspective correctly? Objection: Meat is an affordable source of nutrients. It tastes so good, and everyone around me is eating it. Animal-free diets are too expensive. Some people live in food deserts. Response: We all need nutrition that tastes good and is affordable, right? You, or people you know, may have struggled to access quality food, and you’re worried about making those experiences worse? These are only examples of what empathy might sound like in a few situations. The gist is to connect with what’s truly important for the person in front of you, and let them know you hear it (and, that you value that thing too!) Empathy For Other Objections Animal advocates in the US have recently been taking to the streets for a different kind of outreach: advocating for pro-animal ballot initiatives. In these conversations, we encounter not only the above objections, but many more that have nothing to do with animals at all. When you have the time, try offering a line of empathy to these, too. Objection: I don’t have time. I already donate to so many things, including my time, so I just don’t have time for one more thing. Response: I hear how spread thin you feel.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/empathy-with-our-opposition-persuading-through-nonviolent-communication/","You’re contributing to so many things.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/empathy-with-our-opposition-persuading-through-nonviolent-communication/","Objection: There are too many things on the ballot. I don’t trust the electorate. Politicians need to do their jobs. Response: Of course, wouldn’t it be great if we could trust politicians to pass the laws we need? Objection: You’re wasting your time. This will never pass. Response: I hear the shock that we would even ask for this. After Empathy, Advocate Once we’ve expressed that we’re listening and understand where someone is coming from, our messages are much more likely to persuade. This will help us avoid an adversarial dynamic where each side is trying to win over the other, and instead allow a collaborative conversation where shifting an opinion doesn’t require giving up dignity. For more advice about where to go next in these conversations, check out the FAQ page on the Pro-Animal Future website. And be sure to stay tuned for more detailed guidance as we enter into Phase 2 of the slaughterhouse and fur ban campaigns in Denver. Incorporating empathetic questioning into our advocacy efforts can be truly transformative. Our research suggests that Americans become more open to our message after receiving empathy for their objections. By understanding and connecting with the values that underpin these objections, we can foster meaningful dialogue and, ultimately, create positive change. So let's remember that empathy is not a sign of weakness but a powerful tool for transformation. For more insights on persuasion and our research, visit narrative.paxfauna.org.

"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-spread-veganism/","Part 2 ofIt’s Social Norms, Stupid This is the second in a series of three articles. Inpart one, I made the case that the farmed animal movement’s dominant theory of change is neglecting the role of social norms in shaping people’s attachment to meat, resulting in incomplete strategies. In this section, I introduce the science of social networks, which has cast new light on how changes in norms spread. Inpart three, I’ll build on this science to discuss how social movements can unleash the power of social networks to change norms at scale, particularly for the animal freedom movement. The Gist Gordian Knot Amongst animal advocates, there is a lot of excitement about a theory of change we can call theTaste, Price, Convenience (TPC) postulate.This theory holds that the moment animal-free foods taste the same or better, cost the same or less, and are as accessible as animal meat, people will choose to buy them instead. But it is incomplete. In fact,taste, price, and convenience represent just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to people’s food choices. Consciously, people are motivated by strong cultural attachments to meat from animals, as well as values connected to naturalism. But the (often unconscious) influence of social reinforcement is even more important. Most people can’t imagine being the first one in their social group to change what they eat. As long as everyone else keeps eating animals, they will too. The most convincing arguments won’t matter.","text",4

Nodes and Connections It turns out that a simple shift in perspective holds the key. When we think about influencing the behavior of individuals, we run into a roadblock: their relationships with other people are stopping them from changing. But social reinforcement doesn't have to be our foe. In fact, it can be a powerful tool. The reason lies in the young science of social networks.","text",7

From this perspective, the attributes of individual nodes are much less important than the connections between them, and the way those connections are arranged.","text",10

"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-spread-veganism/","On an individual level, humans are unique and full of quirks. But once we are arranged into a social network and norms take over, our individual traits stop having much effect on the behavior of the network. The larger and more complex the network gets, the more we start to look like legos: interchangeable. The behavior of the system is determined by how the blocks are connected to each other, much more than any traits of the blocks themselves. Why It Matters Once again, this may all seem a bit elementary. But the simple fact is that up to this point,the farmed animal movement has not been engaging with society according to this perspective.Efforts at influencing public behavior have focused on individuals, barely sparing a thought for the relationships between them. We have already established that the influence of relationships is one piece missing from the Taste, Price, Convenience postulate. Classic vegan outreach methods like leafleting share this flaw. Targeting individuals with information ignores the social forces that prevent them from changing their diet. This more than suffices to explain high recidivism rates among vegetarians and the inefficacy of leaflets. Realizing this,many animal advocates have given up on winning over the public.Most of the organizations that used to focus on leafleting have redirected their attention to corporate welfare campaigns1To the extent that these campaigns (and protest activity more generally) have a goal of influencing the public, they represent a shotgun approach, reaching individuals at random without any attention to social clusters or a systematic plan for altering the public’s views (that I am aware of).(not to mention their budgets: such campaigns now guzzle60% of total farmed animal fundingfrom Effective Altruism-aligned grantmakers). While these campaigns may be worthwhile, it’s hard for me not to interpret this as a white flag.","text",13

It imagines that all the problems of animal-free meat adoption can be addressed there. That’s not how people work. We are social, and anything a tenth as fundamental and controversial as food is processed through our social selves. The price and chemistry of alternative meats may have an important role to play. But ultimately, the matter of animal freedom will be settled in the social arena. I’m here to tell you that we don’t need to give up on social change for animals. In fact, the very social network science that explains why individual diet change advocacy was so ineffective offers a different and far more powerful solution. The Myth of Virality Social networks attracted the attention of researchers in the mid-20th century.Since the beginning, the principal metaphor used to describe how change spreads through these networks has been avirus.One person adopts a change, then introduces it to everyone they meet. Each connection presents an opportunity for the virus to spread. As long as each person spreads the change to more people (and sticks with it themselves) it’s only a matter of time before the change has spread throughout society. For decades, this metaphor of viral spread was the accepted mechanism for social change. A social media post or hashtag, a new slang word or hand gesture for greeting, a diet or health philosophy, or a political idea would all spread like a virus through social connections. This theory led to three familiar ideas about how change happens, which in turn became common sense. How Viruses Spread: The Old Model That last one is less widely known, but in fact, it describes the thesis of the most-cited paper in the entire field of sociology. That paper is Mark Granovetter’s “The Strength of Weak Ties” published in 1970. Granovetter's study began with the observation that not all connections are equal.","text",15
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-spread-veganism/","Our connection to our friends and families is not the same as our connection to the dentist we see twice a year.Strong tiesare the core of our social network, people we see many times a week.Weak tiesare our casual acquaintances, our outer circle.","text",16
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-spread-veganism/","The key difference for Granovetter was that weak ties lack redundancy. Accordingly, information will spread faster through people who don’t know each other very well, because they’re much less likely to know the same people (compared to close friends, who are also close friends with each others’ close friends). Distinguishing strong ties and weak ties was a brilliant insight. It propelled Granovetter to fame and helped establish the field of network science. Yet as it turns out, that distinction contained a seed that would grow to turn this entire paradigm on its head. Dentists Don’t Spread Veganism In the last couple decades, a new wave of research has radically overturned the understanding of social changethat reigned when Granovetter published “The Strength of Weak Ties”. Social media and other digital technologies have enabled scientists to look inside these networks for the first time. One such scientist, Damon Centola, surveys this new era of research and its importance for changemakers in his recent bookChange. Without hesitation, I would call this one of the two most important books published on social change in the last decade. (The other being Mark and Paul Engler’sThis Is an Uprising, which I’ll discuss in part 3 of this series.) The rest of this post represents my best effort to summarize the relevance of this research to animal advocates in a few hundred words. That said, I implore any serious strategist to download and start readingChangeimmediately. Like Granovetter, Centola’s work rests on a crucial distinction:simple contagionsvs.complex contagions.It turns out that simple changes do indeed spread through social networks like a virus. If, for instance, you want to spread information about a breaking news event, the strategies above are effective.","text",17
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-spread-veganism/","Highly connected influencers and other weak ties help information spread fast across different social groups.The defining quality of a simple contagion is that it doesn’t encounterresistanceto its spreadthrough the network. One or two exposures to the contagion is enough not only to change someone, but to make them a spreader. If you have a literal virus and you stay at home, it will just bounce around among your family or housemates until everyone is immune. But if you bring it to your dentist, she might spread it to dozens of other households before she has any idea she’s sick.","text",18
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-spread-veganism/","But the viral model breaks down with complex contagions. Spreading a behavior change is fundamentally different from spreading information or a virus. Changing one’s behavior comes at a cost: time, attention, and most importantly, social belonging. Most people won’t bear the cost of a behavior change just because their dentist is doing it. (Be honest, how often have you really been flossing lately2I’ve actually been flossing regularly for the first time in my life, but it had nothing to do with my dentist: two of my housemates floss twice a day, often in common areas. This is a perfect demonstration of the power of strong ties!?) The higher the cost, the more resistance the contagion will encounter. And the more resistance a change encounters, the more it must rely on a set of strategies that are almost exactly the opposite of the old paradigm described above. The Snowball Strategy Although this new model for changing social norms is a major departure from the influencer model, in its own way, it is also fairly intuitive. The starting principle is thatthe basis of a social norm is thatmost people are doing it.The bulk number of people doesn’t matter as much as thepercentageof people who have adopted the behavior. And from the perspective of any individual in the network, that means the percentage of peoplethey are connected withwho have adopted it.","text",19

"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-spread-veganism/","Let’s consider the network diagram above. Imagine it represents all the people who attend services at a neighborhood church. The core of the community is made up of people who regularly attend service and are involved in other programs the church puts on. These core individuals are highly interconnected and have strong ties with many other people in the community. At the very center of the network would be the pastor, who has strong ties with everyone in the core and many in the periphery. If you wanted to spread a behavior change through this church community, where would you start? By now, you understand that it depends on what kind of change you want to spread, and how much resistance you expect. If resistance will be low, the logical place to start would be with the pastor. Imagine the pastor sometimes has a hard time getting everyone to quiet down when she needs to make an announcement. Your idea is that when everyone is talking and one person raises their hand, everyone who sees them raises their hand and goes quiet, until the whole group has gotten quiet enough to hear an announcement. If you get the pastor on board, she can announce this new method at a few Sunday services. Soon, everyone will be notified of the change and it will become the new norm. Reforming the Church But what if you’re spreading a complex contagion? What if you want this church community to embrace the farmed animal movement, or even establish a norm of getting arrested protesting violence against animals? Even in a very liberal church, this will be no easy task. You’re expecting a lot of resistance. Should you start with the pastor? It may be a moot point; she’s very unlikely to start advocating this from the pulpit if it’s significantly outside the social norms of the church. Like any community leader, part of her job is to reflect the values of the community. If she strays too far away from that, people will start to leave, or she’ll get fired.","text",22
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-spread-veganism/","In fact, even if she did start calling for the community to change their values and norms to include civil disobedience for animals, it would likely just demonstrate the limits of her leadership position. People might ignore her.","text",23
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-spread-veganism/","When it comes to social norms, trusted influencers might have a bit more sway than the average community member. But this is more than counterbalanced by their highly connected position in the network. When it came to simple contagions, this high connectivity was an asset. But for spreading complex contagions, it becomes a weakness. Even if the pastor adopts the change, she’ll be surrounded by people who haven’t, and allthosepeople will be surrounded by people who haven’t. All those other people representcountervailing influences: resistance to the new norm, in the form of reminders that the old familiar norm is still going strong. The pastor only makes up a small percentage of each person’s social network in the church. Despite her respected position, the pastor alone cannot declare a new social norm of such magnitude in this highly interconnected community. If she tries to, she’ll just invite a rebellion. Power Lies on the Periphery When it comes to spreading changes that face resistance, the potential for change lies on the network’s periphery.Looking at the diagram above, these are the green nodes that each have three or fewer connections. These people sporadically attend service and only have a few social connections in the church.The magic of the periphery is that change initiatives that begin here have a chance to build momentum before running up against the full force of the entrenched social norm and the countervailing influence of the highly interconnected network core. Let’s say you have a finite amount of energy you’re able to invest in getting this church on board with animal freedom. You could spend all that energy trying to persuade the pastor. Even if you can convince her to take a big social risk, it may not even matter; she’s only one person. Instead, you could identify someone on the periphery of the community. You find Sally, a hip 20-something who is already sympathetic to the movement. Sally has a small friend group of four.","text",24
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-spread-veganism/","If you can help Sally convince one of her friends to get involved, suddenly, half of their friend group is on board with your campaign. Already, you can see how the dynamics here on the periphery are quite different than at the network core. For the other two members of this friend group, doing civil disobedience for animals will quickly become something they associate with their social life in the church; half of their friends are doing it. The power of social norms means they’ll be easier to convert, especially if Sally and her friend keep reminding them about it.","text",25
"https://paxfauna.org/social-norms-spread-veganism/","By now you can see why Centola calls this theSnowball Strategy.Looking at the diagram again, we can imagine the new change creeping across the network periphery, then encroaching on the core. Once 10 or 15% have converted to the new norm, its momentum is palpable and impossible to ignore. Now, if the pastor gets on board, she’ll have the backing of an organic movement. The tipping point is within reach. Spreading Complex Contagions Over the last two decades, social network scientists have found more and more evidence thatcomplex social contagions spread most effectively through strong ties on the network periphery. This is just the opposite of simple contagions,which spread rapidly through influencers and weak ties. (Centola effectively surveys much of this evidence inChange,with a lengthy appendix on further reading.) This research has been made possible by social media platforms and other digital technologies. These recreate the dynamics of social networks while enabling interactions and connections to be recorded and measured. Taken together, this body of research arms social change strategists with a new playbook, an uncanny inversion of the strategies listed earlier for viral spread. Overcoming Resistance to Change: The New Model Norms, Networks, and… Around this point, you might be thinking, “OK Aidan, I can see how this all could be applied to a church. But how can we apply this to a whole society? It all seems a bit abstract.” Well, that’s a great question. I wish I’d thought of it myself! Because it leads us directly to what I personally find to be the most exciting thing about all of this. Centola’s work on social networks provides the most compelling answer I’ve seen yet to a question that has confounded sociologists for decades: Why do social movements (and protest movements in particular) seem to be such an effective strategy for changing social norms?","text",26

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","Evolving Together: Executive Summary of an 18-month Messaging Study on Animal Farming The research summarized below is discussed in depth in a series of five reports available atpaxfauna.org/reports Introduction Pax Fauna exists to design a new Social Movement Organization (SMO) meant to accelerate the end of animal farming in the United States. By using both primary and secondary research as well as careful reflection on our experience as animal rights social movement organizers, our mission is to improve on past efforts and catalyze a strategic nonviolent mass movement for animals. This study is an integral part of that mission. Overall, it was designed primarily to inform the messaging and strategy of a new SMO. Additionally, we believe many of our findings will be helpful to other advocates. This report is intended for anybody engaged in advocacy to the general public on behalf of farmed animals, alone or on behalf of an organization. It may also help inform organizations choosing political or strategic demands for campaigns that involve public messaging. Social movements (typically characterized by large-scale grassroots organizing, mass protest, and related activities) are a potent tool available to changemakers. The strength of social movement strategies does not, however, lie in their ability to enact specific, discrete policy reforms. Consider the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement between roughly 2013 and 2021. The policy demands of BLM involved reforming and restricting the powers of police, ultimately settling on a demand to move funding away from police departments. As of summer 2022, the policy demand of defunding the police remains largely hypothetical, with the few cities that explored the idea now reversing course. Through only this lens, Black Lives Matter may seem like a flop. We think this view is sorely mistaken. Rather, it is obvious that the movement transformed American culture in profound ways.","text",1
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","A Google News search for “canceled for decades-old tweets” reveals numerous high-profile stories, each an exemplar of our society’s rapid evolution concerning racial mores. These phenomena demonstrate thepower of social movementsto shift norms and narratives.","text",2
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","We believe that a focus on changing norms and narratives is missing from the strategic ecosystem of the movement for farmed animals, and that social movement strategies are an appropriate tool to fill that gap. For Pax Fauna, the primary goal of creating an SMO is to seize the narrative around animals used for food. We believe the cultural shift created by a mass social movement would then open up space for policy-focused “Inside Game” organizations to pursue more ambitious policies than would otherwise be feasible. This study was designed to deeply investigate the active, latent, and potential narratives which already exist in society’s relationship to farmed animals, and to identify vulnerabilities in the dominant narrative as well as promising new narratives with which to replace it. Various surveys from the previous decade suggested that such vulnerabilities exist, perhaps most notablyone by Sentience Institutefinding that as many as 48% of Americans would support a ban on slaughterhouses (while also affirming that eating meat is a personal choice). We hypothesized that there iswidespread but latent support among the publicfor the goals of animal advocates and thatactivating this support is a problem of framing. Framing refers to patterns of language that shape the way people interpret information. Frames exist primarily as different kinds of metaphors we use to make sense of the world, many of which are coded into the physical architecture of our brains in early childhood. Frames get their name from their ability to bring certain information into view while leaving other information out. Framing can be much more subtle than the familiarglass half empty/glass half full. UC Berkeley cognitive scientist George Lakoff has been a leading thinker in applying the study of frames to political views.","text",3
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","Lakoff hastheorizedthat different metaphors of how a family should operate can explain a broad range of policy disagreements among American conservatives and liberals: conservatives subconsciously envision the government as astrict, disciplinarian father, while liberals (also subconsciously) see it as anurturant parent. Each side favors policies befitting their metaphor. The strict father government’s role should be keeping the family safe from outside threats and enforcing discipline at home (corresponding to military spending and strict criminal punishment). Meanwhile, the nurturant government ought to keep the children happy and healthy, celebrate their individuality, and teach them tolerance (progressive social laws and a strong welfare state). According to Lakoff, each of these frames is present in the minds of most Americans, and when activated through political messaging, can lead people to support one set of policies or another.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","Among animal advocates, discourse about framing has often centered around the relative efficacy of messages focused onanimal cruelty, environmental harm,orhuman health. In the context of this study, we would refer to these assubjectsortopicsof a message rather than frames. The frames we wished to investigate operate on a deeper, more subconscious level, much like Lakoff’s family metaphors. For instance, in the aforementioned survey, many people (almost half of the respondents) agreed with both of the following statements: To advocates, these statements seem obviously contradictory, as banning slaughterhouses would have the effect of imposing vegetarianism on the vast majority of people. Yet contradictions like this are commonplace in public opinion data on all kinds of topics. In his bookMerge Left, UC Berkeley law professor Ian Haney-Lopez describes a similar contradiction in his research on public opinion on race issues. Most respondents expressed agreement with both of the following statements: The contradiction here is even more overt. What explains it? Response bias is one explanation, but Haney-Lopez’s qualitative research in focus groups suggested that these responses were accurately capturing a real contradiction. Framing provides an alternate explanation. Lakoff explains that like muscles, different frames have amutually inhibitiverelationship. That is, looking at an issue through one frame tends to turn off another that would draw our attention to conflicting information, much the same as how flexing your bicep deactivates your tricep. It’s possible to flex both at the same time, but you have to fight against your brain to do so, and it is uncomfortable. Simultaneously looking through contradictory frames is likewise an uncomfortable reminder that the world is too complicated to be captured in simple statements, so we tend not to do it.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","One of our starting hypotheses was that the survey result about banning slaughterhouses is evidence that pro-movement frames already exist in the minds of at least 48% of the public, waiting to be activated. Our goal was to identify those frames and find messages that can reliably draw them out. The frame in the “personal choice” question is relatively clear: it is what we call theconsumer framethroughout these reports.The consumer frame focuses on the relationship between the individual consumer and their food retailers, conjuring strong values ofpersonal choiceandautonomyas well as images of shopping at a grocery store or dining at a restaurant. From this perspective, consumers have a hard time envisioning large-scale change.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","What frames were respondents using to think about the issue when expressing support for a ban on slaughterhouses and other animal-friendly policies? Our research was designed to identify those frames and test whether messages based on them could broaden support for the movement to end animal farming. Interestingly, just as we were preparing to release these reports, Rethink Priorities issued a paper by Neil Dullaghan casting doubt on the existence of high levels of support for banning slaughterhouses discussed above. We reached a similar conclusion: participants in our study were not nearly so warm to the idea of banning slaughterhouses as those earlier surveys led us to expect. We do, however, maintain a caveat: while those surveys do not appear to accurately reflect public support for a slaughterhouse ban as it exists right now, they do point to a deep ambivalence that can be tapped into with the right messaging strategies. We recommend such strategies below. Methods This report summarizes a sequence of studies conducted over a period of 18 months, each involving several components leading sequentially one into the next. Each of these studies is discussed in a separate report detailing the methods, findings, and extensive messaging recommendations. The research was completed (and is intended to be read) in the following order: Altogether, these reports present findings from more than 100 hours of interviews with over 200 meat-eating Americans, along with analyses of hundreds of academic papers, opinion polls, news articles, advocate press releases, and industry advertisements.Because they rely primarily on qualitative research methods, our findings generally do not include quantitative claims.

However, the thread described here, which runs through all of our reports, describes a critical challenge that is being widely neglected by current messaging strategies.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","Animal advocates focus our messaging energy on conveying the harms of animal agriculture. In press releases, videos, and social media posts, animal advocates focus on informing the public. We share information about the cognitive abilities of animals and argue that this makes them worthy of moral consideration. We also share information about common practices in modern animal farms, the environmental impact of farming animals, and the impact of animal products on human health. But much of the public is already aware of these harms. Participants in our study were aware of the ethical considerations of using and killing animals for food. Many remembered seeing disturbing footage of modern farms and slaughterhouses. Many had heard claims that animal products are not healthy, but they had also heard claims that animal products are necessary for complete nutrition, and they were skeptical of new information. Claims about environmental harms were the least salient; many vaguely remembered hearing that farming cows was an environmental issue but most did not understand how or why (hypothesizing, for instance, that factory-style slaughterhouses were the source of emissions). There is an opportunity for further education about the mechanisms by which farming animals contributes to climate and ecological harm, but spreading this information is an uphill battle: the public is so accustomed to hearing that fossil fuels are the cause of climate change that it can be difficult for them to grasp the importance of agricultural emissions. Even when they could, most participants found harm to animals to be the most compelling reason to consider a shift away from meat, though well-informed participants who had a prior understanding of the environmental link were sometimes notable exceptions. The public’s resistance to change is not based on a lack of information. Instead, while troubled by what happens to animals used for food, most people remain deeply attached to animal meat.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","This attachment is rationalized using values likeculture, tradition,andnaturalness.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","Our participants described actively “trying not to think about” the ethical implications of their choice to buy animal meat. When they do think and talk about it, they experience moral discomfort. Most used one or more of these common rationalizations to alleviate that moral discomfort: Of these rationalizations, the most pervasive is futility. Futility was often the most effective rationalization participants used to resolve their moral discomfort, and it was perhaps the most common. In our participants’ view, the fact that society would certainly never stop farming animals absolved them of any responsibility in the situation. Futility is grounded in the consumer frame. To our participants, removing animals from the food system seems like an impossible change. Operating from the consumer frame, they cannot see any mechanism for such a transformation. They don’t believe that consumers and businesses around them would change and they don’t see a reason to do it alone. They see their consumer choices as the only impact they can have, and that impact seems negligible. Shifting people out of the consumer frame is the key to making a future without slaughterhouses seem possible. The consumer frame leaves out the role of government and corporate policy in shaping people’s food choices. When thinking only of each individual consumer, change seems impossible. Advocates must reframe the conversation away from the consumer frame and create a role for these key players to help people imagine a society-wide transition away from farming animals. Theconsumer frameis the default way that Americans think about food. Reframing our conversation about animals and food is easier said than done. The language that experts and advocates use amongst themselves to discuss a societal transition away from farming animals will not suffice for messaging to the public.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","Because the public is so accustomed to thinking of food through the consumer frame, a great deal of discipline is needed on the part of advocates. Advocates should be aware of the ways their messaging can inadvertently trigger counterproductive dominant narratives.Critically, any ask of the public to change their food purchasing in the immediate term is, on some level, at odds with a message about government intervention into the food system.","text",12
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","Top 3 Recommendations 1. Shift from consumer-centric to citizen-centric narratives. In as many ways as possible, animal advocates should seek to shift their relationship with the public. People play many different roles in their lives, and two roles that nearly everyone plays are aconsumerof products, and acitizenof a society. (By citizen, we don’t mean to focus on legal citizenship, but rather on an individual’s status as a member of an interdependent society.) People look at the world differently depending on which role is primary at any given moment. The values people focus on in their roles as consumers (personal freedom, consumer choice, and autonomy) do not lead them to support the goals of animal advocates. We can gain broader support by engaging with the public in their role ascitizens. This is where the interests of others are more greatly considered and the possibility of collective change, guided by the government, is possible. This shift is a matter of both messaging and strategy. In messaging, advocates should diligently remove references to personal responsibility such as ‘by eating vegan, you save x animals, y gallons of water, and z tons of methane.’ (An alternative would be ‘ending the farming of animals is one vital solution we need in order to limit warming to 1.5°C.’) Advocates should also think about how to create specific asks of the public which engage them as citizens, such as voting for ballot measures or animal-friendly political candidates. 2. Use the metaphor ofevolutionto overcome futility and describe a society-wide shift away from farming animals. The consumer frame is the dominant, default way of thinking about food, including animals used for food. It is not enough to remove overt consumer language from our messaging; the audience will simply insert the frames they are accustomed to. Instead, advocates must actively work to create a more productive narrative to compete with the consumer frame.","text",13
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","The most promising reframe we identified in our research centers around the metaphor ofevolution.Describing societyevolving togetheraway from farming animals helped our study participants imagine a gradual transition at the societal level, whereas previously they could only hear advocate messaging as a demand to go vegan immediately. Theevolutionmetaphor also conjuresprogressandmodernity,helping suppress counter-arguments based on nature and tradition. Crucially, once this metaphor was introduced, research participants would often incorporate it into their own statements, suggesting a narrative based on it would have the potential to spread independently of advocates.","text",14
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","We developed the outlines of a narrative we callevolve together,which we recommend incorporating into your messaging strategy. Here is an example: We’re calling for an evolution away from meat at the societal level, where consumers, food producers, restaurants, and grocery stores work together to replace meat from animals and fishes with animal-free foods. We can protect animals and the environment using traditional staples like beans and vegetables along with innovative meat alternatives. The components of this message are broken down further in the report on individual interviews. 3. Elevatemeat-eating messengersto highlight citizen action and expand the base of the movement. Discourse about who should deliver advocacy messages often focuses on theauthorityof the speaker. However, we found that for animal advocacy,relatabilityandtrustworthinesswere more important. This is largely connected to defensiveness on the part of the public. Participants in our research were primed to hear even the most gentle animal advocate messages as harshly judgemental. Many of the issues around using animals for food have less to do with facts and more to do with moral values. In such cases, authoritative messengers are not the most useful. We found that messengers who explicitly mention that they still eat meat were perhaps the most effective strategy to overcome defensiveness. Meat-eating messengers make it clear that they are not condemning the listener because they themselves are still engaged in the same behavior. These messengers show that it is possible to be an active supporter of the goal of ending the use of animals for food regardless of your diet in the short term. The power of the meat-eating messenger is enabling the audience to imagine themselves identifying with the cause.","text",15

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","Other Top Recommendations 4. Target thehumane deceptionwith“It’s no secret.” Members of the public broadly distinguish between two categories of farms:small family farmsandlarge industrial farms.Their thinking about this categorical distinction is rife with contradictions. Small farms are romanticized but seen as unrealistic, while large farms are seen as a necessary evil. Even still, many people personally believe their meat is sourced from small farms. Labels such as “cage-free” and “free range” are controversial: some consumers have high confidence in them, others consider them meaningless, and still others are doubtful but feel they have little choice but to trust them. The narrative of thesmall family farmis pervasive but vulnerable. We found that information about the ubiquity of industrial farming, paired with assertions that this information is widely known, was often able to change the course of conversations. Advocates should not allow the opposition to sow confusion with a tale aboutsmall family farmersand abetter wayof farming animals. Instead, spread the word that it is “no secret” that 99% of animals are raised in factory farms and that “cage-free” conditions are inhumane. (When shown images and descriptions of conditions in a cage-free egg farm, most people found them repellent.) 5. Actively target rationalizations based on culture, naturalness, and freedom of choice. While there is a need to continue to spread information about the ethical and environmental harms of animal farming, advocates should make room in their messaging strategy for directly addressing common rationalizations. When we don’t engage with these objections, we risk being seen as out of touch. Here are the most common rationalizations we observed and a suggested strategy to preempt them: 6. Give empathy to the rationalizations of the meat-eating public. Along withmeat-eating messengers,empathy is an effective strategy for overcoming defensiveness.","text",17
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","When advocates encounter common rationalizations such as those discussed above, rather than immediately jumping into a rebuttal, we have an opportunity to respond with curiosity and connection.","text",18
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","At the level of individual outreach, this is a time to ask questions and try to identify the values underpinning the objection. In a mass-messaging context, advocates can affirm the most common values. For instance, a video advertisement could depict people observing a family tradition and explaining its importance to them while using animal-free food in place of meat. Affirming the importance of those values is a way to show the public that we are regular citizens sharing common values, and let them know what universal values underpin our position. In our research, participants would often talk themselves out of a rationalization if they were given empathy for the underlying values. 7. Pursue policy demands focused on making animal-free foods moreaffordable and accessible. The affordability and accessibility of animal-free foods were among the public’s top concerns. We were surprised how many of our research participants named food deserts as a reason to be wary of a societal transition towards animal-free food. Advocate messages that failed to address these issues were seen as out of touch. This presents an opportunity for advocates. Policy demands that specifically address the affordability and accessibility of alternatives to animal meat sit at the intersection of advocate and public concerns. These demands can show the public that we care about their immediate economic reality as well as about animal suffering. These are ideal demands to focus public attention on. 8. Use non-exaggerated facts and provide citations. Participants in our research demonstrated ambivalence towards facts. One of the most common responses we heard to test messages was that advocates should use less emotion and instead “focus on facts and data.” However, when facts were presented, people expressed skepticism, questioning the methods as well as the intentions and funding sources of the researchers producing them.","text",19
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","These responses fit with the popular narrative of waning public trust in institutions and authority figures.","text",20
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","The strongest messages were those which included some kind of numerical fact,along with a citationwhere readers could investigate the data themselves. In our case, this usually didn’t mean naming a specific study in the message we tested, but rather providing a link for optional further reading. Due to the format of the study, participants could not actually click the link. Nevertheless, they expressed feeling significantly greater confidence in the facts precisely because of these links. While we doubt most people would click through such a link if they could, simply offering the link greatly increases advocates’ credibility. The most effective numerical facts make an explicit comparison between how things are now and how they could be if society evolved beyond using animals for food. Instead of “animal agriculture is responsible for x% of emissions,” consider “completely replacing animal agriculture with plants could eliminate y% of emissions.” We also recommend erring on the conservative side of any range when making numerical claims. Higher numbers were more likely to be met with skepticism, while lower numbers were usually just as convincing. Because the public is wary of misinformation, using high numbers could cause people to feel deceived later and break trust in animal advocates. Advocates should resist the temptation to use the highest end of a possible range (e.g. for describing the very uncertain share of greenhouse gas emissions produced by farming animals). 9. Tone down emotional language without sacrificing emotional connections. Another very common objection to advocate messages was that emotionally elevated language is seen as manipulative or hysterical. At the same time, without creating some emotional connection to the issue, participants simply saw it as irrelevant. The challenge for advocates is to use messages that create an emotional connection between the listener and animal suffering without being seen as emotionally manipulative.","text",21
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","In all cases, advocates should start by pruning excessive emotional language from their messages. Make scant use of adverbs, avoid absolute statements, and opt for less emotionally charged synonyms to seem more credible. Trust that the plain facts of the situation are tragic enough.","text",22

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","11. Meticulously avoid jargon and activist-speak. We recommend every advocacy organization bring even more attention to screening their messages for words and phrases that are unfamiliar to the general public. For instance, we tested one message from an advocacy organization that mentioned a “deadpile” inside a pig farm. While this seems obviously to refer to a pile of dead pigs, many participants tripped on this word, expressing confusion followed by frustration about the uncertain meaning of the word instead of engaging with the content of the message. When possible, every single message should be focus-grouped with ordinary people to catch jargon before publishing. 12. Beware of health-centered messaging, which inadvertently triggers the consumer frame. Health remains one topic where the American public is highly resistant to applying systemic analysis. Instead, most people see health as almost exclusively a product of good or bad personal choices, while laws and regulations meant to promote healthy behavior are seen as government overreach. Advocates should be aware that health-based arguments are unlikely to build support for public policy campaigns and may even backfire. Some research has found that most people report health as the most compelling reason to consider a vegetarian or vegan diet, compared with animals or the environment. However, a closer examination of this research shows that those who find health themostcompelling reason findallthree reasons uncompelling; these people still eat meat, after all. The smaller number who prefer animal- or environment-centered appeals find all three reasons more compelling than those who prefer health appeals. Furthermore, qualitative research (ours and others’) suggests that many people who initially deny any concern for farmed animals are in fact burying their concern under a thin layer of avoidance. More research is needed, but advocates should be cautious with health-based arguments.","text",26
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","These arguments may suppress systemic thinking and erode support for policy interventions, and they may not even have broad appeal in consumer advocacy.","text",27
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","Advocates using health messaging to build support for policy interventions can focus their messages on public health, using statistics about collective rather than individual harm (such as the number of deaths per year associated with meat consumption). We also recommend discussingfood desertsto remind people about systemic factors affecting health. 13. Treat thebase, persuadables,andoppositiondifferently. The public, of course, is not monolithic in their views on farming animals. There are countless ways advocates can segment the public and think about targeting messages to different populations. This kind of segmentation was mostly outside the scope of our research. We applied only the simplest form of segmentation and found it to be useful: dividing the public into a relatively sympatheticbase, a hostileopposition, and thepersuadable middle. We first imagined creating these segments based on responses to a standard animal rights survey question asking respondents to choose from three options: However, our research cast serious doubt on the utility of this question to predict people’s sympathy towards farmed animals. Instead, we developed a simple predictive model based on political orientation, age, gender, and meat reduction intention, with meat reduction and politics each receiving triple weight relative to age and gender. This model is described in detail in a forthcoming report on survey experiments. The most important thing to understand about these groups is that the base (roughly a quarter to a third of the public) is receptive to altruistic appeals, while the persuadable middle (well over half) is easier to motivate by activating disgust. The opposition, meanwhile, is unreachable any time in the near future. For the base, animal- and environment-centered messages were seen as mutually reinforcing rather than contradictory. These people are willing to base both their consumer habits and their political views on the best interests of the many.","text",28
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","Persuadables were unmoved by altruistic messages. For them, the key is to activate disgust. Fortunately, moral disgust is closely tied to other kinds of disgust, so images of the conditions in factory farms reduce meat appetite and increase approval for meat reduction policies.","text",29
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/evolving-together-executive-summary-of-an-18-month-messaging-study-on-animal-farming/","In messaging strategies and in strategy more broadly, animal advocates should account for the different roles that these three segments will play. 14. Use theradical flank effectto legitimize more ambitious policy objectives. Initially, almost any policy we presented was considered too much, too fast by our research participants. During focus groups, it was as if participants were trying to barter down to a more moderate proposal. However, the proposal they settled on was largely dependent on what proposal they saw initially: if they were initially presented with a ballot measure to ban slaughterhouses in 3 years, they said it should be slower. Presented with that proposal, they said meat should be taxed instead of banned. Presented with a meat tax, they favored only subsidizing meat alternatives. In response to a subsidy, they argued for a “public education program” (essentially non-intervention). This was a clear demonstration of the radical flank effect. We clearly saw that the most radical proposal on the table shaped what people saw as reasonable. This is a great opportunity for animal advocates. Whatever policy objectives the movement wishes to enact in the short term, we should ensure that significantly more ambitious proposals are in the public’s awareness and are even being actively pursued by a credible radical element. This element does not need to throw molotov cocktails (or evencans of soup) to make moderate demands seem reasonable. Using compassionate messages and working within the bounds of the law to advance a radical proposal (for instance, through a ballot measure) might suffice to create the desired effect, even if advocates privately doubt that the policy has any chance of being enacted soon. 15.Don’t hold back when pitching the media. While all the recommendations above hold for making our case to the media, advocates should be aware that the media is much more sympathetic to our narrative than to that of our opponents.","text",30

"https://paxfauna.org/why-nonviolence-is-existential-for-animal-freedom/","The Gist Why I’m Writing This I’ve been involved in the animal freedom movement since 2015 and I’ve seen, time and time again, conflict slowing down the movement’s momentum. In work that is mainly limited by person-hours and the ability to work together, conflict represents a grave threat. At the same time, conflict is, to misquote Melanie Joy,normal, natural,andnecessary.That’s to say that it would be naive to expect a movementwithoutconflict. The ideal that we should hope for is that as a movement, we learn to process conflict in a healthy and constructive way. But many of us don’t have a very robust model for what healthy conflict looks like. Agreements and shared understanding of how conflict will be practiced can help everyone do their part. Nonviolence—which extends beyond just the physical and includes how we talk to each other and ourselves—can give us a model for healthy conflict within movement groups, giving everyone an idea of what’s expected of them and some skills they can develop towards its execution. For the past couple of years, I’ve offered trainings for animal advocates in Nonviolent Communication in hopes to support norms and skills around healthy conflict. In preparation for my latest set of workshops, I’m offering this blog series about Nonviolence and Nonviolent Communication (NVC) in an effort to provide the content of these trainings in readable form. There is no substitute for practice and hands-on learning, but reading and doing exercises on your own can also be a great way to interact with the material. This piece introduces the concept of Nonviolence and its place in the animal rights movement. It describes starting assumptions and goals of two specific philosophical traditions within nonviolence: Nonviolent Communication and Kingian Nonviolence. Later blogs will describe the vocabulary and practice of Nonviolent Communication and provide exercises to begin the practice.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/why-nonviolence-is-existential-for-animal-freedom/","How I Learned The Importance of Nonviolence I got my start in animal advocacy with Direct Action Everywhere (DxE). DxE is deeply committed to Nonviolence, and back in those days, most of its members were expected to go through a weekend-long training in Kingian Nonviolence. Kingian is a philosophical and principled approach to Nonviolence based on the work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, and studying it gave me a sense of the spiritual foundations of Nonviolence—a sense that relating to each other with unconditional goodwill is the right thing to do, regardless of whether it seems most effective in the short term.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/why-nonviolence-is-existential-for-animal-freedom/","DxE’s trainings were often led by Kazu Haga from the East Point Peace Academy in Oakland. Kazu always stressed that these courses were just scratching the surface. So in 2020 I sought out a teacher Kazu recommended and began an intensive study of Nonviolent Communication (NVC), a practice pioneered by psychologist Marshall Rosenberg. With NVC, Rosenberg sought to use the Nonviolent philosophy of Dr. King and others and build out a set of tools and strategies to help people live out that philosophy in their relationships. Rosenberg left NVC in the care of an organization called the Center for Nonviolent Communication (CNVC), a decision that allows the practice to grow and evolve while still being held to integrity with its founder’s vision. Though I can study and share NVC without becoming certified, it is in the interest of this sense of integrity that I am currently on the path toward fulfilling CNVC’s requests as a certification candidate. Some of my teachers are people who have helped NVC continue to grow after the death of Marshall Rosenberg. I specifically want to nameRoxy Manning, whose work on power and privilege gives me language to link the systemic lens of Kingian Nonviolence with the interpersonal lens of NVC, andSarah Peyton, whose work on Relational Neuroscience deepens my practice and provides insight into the effect that trauma has on our bodies and behaviors. Participating in real-time training, as opposed to only reading, felt crucial for my development of these skills. As I’ll discuss more throughout this series, I deeply encourage real-time practice with other people, either self-organized or through courses. Our Nonviolent Roots Six Principles of Nonviolence NVC is rooted in the traditions of nonviolence on which so many social movement organizations base their activism. Many social movement organizers look to the U.S. civil rights movement as a particularly deep source of inspiration and guidance for building movements today.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/why-nonviolence-is-existential-for-animal-freedom/","The principles below were first laid out in this form by Martin Luther King Jr. as a description of the ethos of the movement that created him.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/why-nonviolence-is-existential-for-animal-freedom/","Principle One Nonviolence is a way of life for courageous people. It is a positive force confronting the forces of injustice, and utilizes the righteous indignation and the spiritual, emotional and intellectual capabilities of people as the vital force for change and reconciliation. Nonviolence seeks to create a third way beyond violence or pacifism. Once, while introducing this concept during an NVC training in a beautiful outdoor space, two dogs who were accompanying training participants began to fight right in front of me. The dogs’ caregivers pulled them apart in the time it took me to drop my notes and start to get to my feet. These caregivers intuitively understood Nonviolence in this moment as an active process to prevent violence. It wasn’t pacifism, sitting back and declining to participate in the dogfight, nor was it violence, such as joining in or adding punishment. They provided exactly the amount of force needed to prevent the fight from continuing, and they did so with a pure intention to care for everyone involved. Similarly, our practice of Nonviolence seeks to intervene in violent institutions. We don’t saylive and let liveorrespect everyone’s path.We seek to stop harm from happening to animals. To the extent that our strategies look gentle, this is for strategic reasons. When force is needed to stop harm, Nonviolence requires it. NVC calls this theprotective use of force. Principle Two The Beloved Community is the framework of the future. The nonviolent concept is an overall effort to achieve a reconciled world by raising the level of relationships among people to a height where justice prevails and persons attain their full human potential. Following the earlier discussion of the protective use of force,we always seek to intervene in a way that allows the door to be open to reconciliation in the future.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/why-nonviolence-is-existential-for-animal-freedom/","NVC isn’t just about resolving conflict in the moment, but laying the foundation for long-lasting harmony, inviting the whole world into King’s vision of the Beloved Community.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/why-nonviolence-is-existential-for-animal-freedom/","When we study NVC, we work a lot with our own internal emotional process. This might seem irrelevant to some people who expect more focus on the external practice of communication in a workshop for animal advocates. However, the more advanced and frequent application of the skills we practice in NVC is in our closest relationships. Maintaining relationships within the movement is crucial to allowing our movement to succeed. Principle Three Attack forces of evil, not persons doing evil. The nonviolent approach helps one analyze the fundamental conditions, policies and practices of the conflict rather than reacting to one's opponents or their personalities. NVC is a communication modality that believes that everyone’s needs matter, and every single thing a person does is an attempt to meet a need, no matter how tragic. Nonviolence is how we might choose to be if we really believed that. “Everything a person does is an attempt to meet a need” is a radical statement. When I don’t get pushback while introducing it in a workshop, I assume it hasn’t been understood. What I’m saying is thatallactions, no matter how violent or despicable, are attempts to meet needs that we all share—such as a need for significance, self-expression, or belonging. This is not to say that we excuse or enable violent actions. Again, Nonviolence means interfering to prevent violence from happening. By understanding the needs that people and institutions are trying to meet by committing violent actions, we can help them find better,nonviolentways of meeting those same needs. Thus, we can work towards a world where everyone’s needs are met. Principle Four Accept suffering without retaliation for the sake of the cause to achieve the goal.Self-chosen suffering is redemptive and helps the movement growin a spiritual as well as a humanitarian dimension. The moral authority of voluntary suffering for a goal communicates the concern to one's own friends and community as well as to the opponent.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/why-nonviolence-is-existential-for-animal-freedom/","While this principle is often rightly applied to political sacrifices, such as facing incarceration, an NVC lens would ask us to apply it to interpersonal conflict. Willingness to suffer means willingness to do unglamorous work, to engage with people we dislike, and to seek to understand our allies and adversaries even when doing so is uncomfortable.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/why-nonviolence-is-existential-for-animal-freedom/","I’m currently facingfeloniesfor my rescue work, but the hardest and most thankless suffering I’ve endured for the movement has been in the conflicts I’ve endured. Even if we aren’t in a position to take legal risk, we can cultivate a more willing attitude towards our own suffering. Accepting discomfort and suffering—physical, emotional, and otherwise—as part of a larger cause imbues it with meaning. Principle Five Avoid internal violence of the spirit as well as external physical violence.The nonviolent attitude permeates all aspects of the campaign. It provides mirror-type reflection of the reality of the condition to one's opponent and the community at large. Specific activities must be designed to help maintain a high level of spirit and morale during a nonviolent campaign. We can think of NVC as a Kingian practice of self-purification. NVC is a practice of building emotional discipline to break habits of judgment and blame so that we can relate with love to everyone, even those causing harm. With this discipline, we can act in a way that maximizes our chances of achieving reconciliation in the end. This is why we teach Nonviolence as an internal practice as well as an external one. Over the rest of this blog series, I’ll describe exercises that ask us to dismantle our own judgmental thoughts before turning our attention to relationships with others. In this way, the project of promoting the study of NVC is to create an internal culture in movement groups that minimize blame and judgment. Principle Six The universe is on the side of justice. Truth is universal and human society and each human being is oriented to the just sense of order of the universe. The fundamental values in all the world's great religions include the concept that the moral arc of the universe bends towards justice. For the nonviolent practitioner, nonviolence introduces a new moral context in whichnonviolence is both the means and the end. Principled nonviolence asks of us a kind of faith.","text",12
"https://paxfauna.org/why-nonviolence-is-existential-for-animal-freedom/","We’re invited to believe in this principle and act accordingly. We believe that the means are present in the ends. That means that if we use violence to get to an outcome, we’ll have violence in the world we’ve created. When we’re in doubt, Nonviolence can be a North Star to guide us toward beloved community.","text",13
"https://paxfauna.org/why-nonviolence-is-existential-for-animal-freedom/","Principled Nonviolence vs Strategic Nonviolence So far, I’ve discussed the principles of Nonviolence and instilled a sense that Nonviolence is the right thing to doeven ifit doesn’t seem effective. This belief can be a guiding force in moments of uncertainty, because acting in integrity with it can make even our mistakes less harmful. But in addition to theprincipled Nonviolencedescribed above, we also draw insight from the narrower concept ofstrategic Nonviolence. Strategicnonviolence was described by Gene Sharp inThe Politics of Nonviolent Action. He sought to divorce Nonviolence from this spiritual dimension to practice its techniques without the God stuff. (The big names in Nonviolence before then, like MLK, Gandhi, and Jesus, were pretty into the God stuff.) He was aware of the extreme capacity for violence that the State has, and that armed resistance justifies the State’s use of violence in the eyes of the public. For Sharp, nonviolence was not necessarily a moral right, but a strategic necessity. He was also interested in the inclusivity of Nonviolent action—that it allows movements to include more people and be truly populist, and the inclusivity of a Nonviolence that doesn’t require subscription to a spiritual element. Like Sharp, I am non-religious and I organize in secular spaces. And yet I resonate with a dimension of the work that speaks to our whole selves, our place in a larger system, and the meaning that our impact will have after we are gone. I believe in the ability of animal advocates, as a community, to accept a secular spiritual element to our Nonviolence. A community of people who are up against a cultural institution with tens of thousands of years of power, who cry at vigils, who watch their own parents eat the bodies of the victims, can handle a spiritual orientation to the work. If you’re not ready for spiritual Nonviolence, then I welcome you to practice first and consider the philosophy later.","text",14
"https://paxfauna.org/why-nonviolence-is-existential-for-animal-freedom/","And don’t get hung up on my use of the wordspiritual—I might mean it more broadly than you think. For instance, my colleague Aidan thinks about the imperative of Nonviolence as: “How can I conduct myself so that if I later realize my convictions were wrong, I can still be proud of the actions I took?”","text",15
"https://paxfauna.org/why-nonviolence-is-existential-for-animal-freedom/","However you approach it, Nonviolence and NVC will offer you tools to improve your relationships, your internal emotional landscape, and your advocacy.

"https://paxfauna.org/report-the-promise-of-direct-democracy-for-momentum-driven-social-movements/","For years, mass social movements have been organized around a crucial belief: that in a functioning democracy, if you can persuade 51% of the population to support a cause, you can affect needed policy change through the democratic process. (This is related to what is called thepopular theory of power: that power in a society is ultimately held by the people through their consent to be governed, which can be withheld.)","text",4

"https://paxfauna.org/report-the-promise-of-direct-democracy-for-momentum-driven-social-movements/","We could say that belief is true by definition, with the key phrase beingfunctioning democracy. In 2014, however, skeptics who had argued this phrase should not be applied to the United States were vindicated. That year, Princeton University published ananalysisof 20 years of data comparing public opinion on different proposed laws to the likelihood those laws would pass. The findings were bleak: the data appears to show that the opinions of the less-wealthy 90% of Americans have virtually no impact on whether or not a bill would become law. Only the economic elites in the top 10% of society (read: the donor class) have any influence over the political process. In other words, the United States is no democracy; it is an oligarchy. While the claims of this study have been debated academically, it would be a mistake to dismiss them out of hand. At best, it may simply be the case that the U.S. political system has become so dysfunctional thatnosegment of the public has any influence over it, that almost no law can be passed regardless of popular support. Either way, the strategy of convincing 51% of the population to support a policy may not be sufficient on its own. A central idea in Pax Fauna’s theory of change is distinguishing betweenculturalandinstitutionalchange strategies. I havewritten elsewhereabout the difference between these and further argued that while they compliment each other at the level of movement ecology, they are generally incompatible within a single organization. However, there is one pathway to concrete policy changes which largely collapses this distinction: direct ballot initiatives. 24 states plus Washington, D.C. allow ordinary citizens to draft statutes and/or state constitutional amendments and collect signatures to have them placed before voters in a general election. A further 39 states make provision for initiatives at the municipal and county levels.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/report-the-promise-of-direct-democracy-for-momentum-driven-social-movements/","Blue-leaning states with statewide initiatives include California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Massachusetts, Nevada and Michigan.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/report-the-promise-of-direct-democracy-for-momentum-driven-social-movements/","Appeal Ballot measures ought to be highly appealing to momentum-driven social movements. First, direct democracy is harmonious with thepopular theory of powerand the focus on winning over the hearts and minds of the public. Second, using state and local campaigns as stepping stones to build power and gain visibility is ideally suited to the cycle of momentum. Ballot campaigns even have an escalation built in, with an initial phase collecting a small number of signatures and a larger phase winning votes from a majority of the public. Third, state-level victories have been key to recent social movement victories, with both Freedom to Marry and the NRA successfully pursuing a state-by-state strategy to create a sense of inevitability around their issue. (Both movements eventually won nationally in the Supreme Court, further bypassing partisan gridlock in Congress.) Fourth, ballot initiatives bypass the House of Cards-style personal and partisan politics of institutional campaigns that rely on influencing individual decision makers, replacing it with a simple numbers game of mass popular appeal in which the cultural and policy objectives are nearly identical. For this reason, a ballot campaign which ends in defeat would still obviously be a productive use of the movement’s time, because the main efforts would be about outreaching to and persuading the public. Contrast this with a failed institutional campaign, in which the individuals or institutions you try to influence are unlikely to do anything at all for your movement the moment your attention has moved away from them. In other words, there is no sunk cost in a ballot initiative campaign. These campaigns also have the potential to bypass the oligarchic dynamics of the normal legislative process. Fifth, state and local ballot issues have proven to be a much more promising pathway for progressive policies than electoral politics.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/report-the-promise-of-direct-democracy-for-momentum-driven-social-movements/","Notably, in 2020, ambitious progressive policies succeeded in states that voted for Trump over Biden and saw Democrats shed congressional seats. Florida passed a $15 minimum wage by nearly 22 points while going for Trump by more than 3 points (following up their enfranchisement of felons in 2018, two years after voting for Trump the first time). Meanwhile Alaska adopted ranked-choice voting, while Montana and South Dakota legalized recreational marijuana. Even in blue states, voters behaved much more progressively on ballot initiatives than congressional elections. Oregon voters decriminalized possession of all drugs in small quantities, by 20 points, while Coloradans created a paid family leave insurance program through the state and joined the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/report-the-promise-of-direct-democracy-for-momentum-driven-social-movements/","Why did voters support these policies while electing politicians who oppose them? The most obvious explanation centers on the fact that the vast majority of voters are minimally aware of politics. Most voters don’t think of policies in terms of “progressive,” “liberal,” or “conservative.” Indeed, even highly partisan voters often know relatively little about their party’s platform beyond a few key issues most important to them. One of the idiosyncrasies of American politics is that while far more voters consider themselves “conservative” than “liberal” or “progressive,” progressives enjoy far more widespread support for their actual policies, from Medicare for All (70% support) and similar economic issues like raising the minimum wage, cancelling student debt, and mandating family leave, even to more cultural issues such as drug enforcement and, yes, abortion. The disconnect can be attributed in part to a far more effective messaging strategy on the part of Republicans than their Democratic counterparts, and more generally to the ability of tribalism to override rational thinking. Psychologist Drew Westen, among others, has demonstrated the powerful effect of tribal affiliation in political decision making, showing that the rational brains of partisan voters in fMRI machines largely shut off the moment a signal of tribal affiliation is introduced into the equation. The success of progressive policies at the ballot box suggests that while Republicans have succeeded in painting Democrats as a party of out-of-touch corporatist elites (which is an entirely accurate portrayal), they have not succeeded in generating opposition to the policy agenda of the populist left, and that when filling out a ballot, voters who loyally elect candidates based on party might take a more discerning approach to deciding how they will vote on ballot measures.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/report-the-promise-of-direct-democracy-for-momentum-driven-social-movements/","In summary, ballot initiatives provide an opportunity for social movement to appeal directly to voters for change, bypassing not only the byzantine political gamesmanship of electoral politics, but also the ideological tribalism which has ground national policy making to a halt, or more accurately, driven it out of congress and into the hands of the executive and the courts. By focusing on ballot initiatives, a social movement could legitimize its struggle with a real institutional demand, and even win real institutional demands, without being caught up in dysfunctional partisan politics (and likely being co-opted by the centrist oligarchy which controls both major parties anyway).","text",12
"https://paxfauna.org/report-the-promise-of-direct-democracy-for-momentum-driven-social-movements/","State-by-State Petition Requirements For campaigners using the momentum theory of change, the most important immediate goal is not winning incremental policy changes, but increasing theactiveandpassive popular supportfor the movement. That means winning more members of the public over to agree with the cause, and getting a smaller subset of them to actually join the movement, increasing its capacity and thus its ability to reach the public. Concrete policy changes are a tertiary goal in the immediate term. That said, winning concrete demands can be crucial to sustaining momentum, and a well-designed policy goal will also have a real, immediate positive impact on people’s lives (animals lives in this case). Winning a ballot initiative campaign requires two subsequent victories: collecting enough signatures to get the issue on the ballot, and winning a majority (or sometimes a supermajority) at the polls. Clearly, both of these objectives are totally compatible with the larger goal of social and cultural change; both are examples of passive popular support. Thus anything which exists in the arsenal of momentum campaigning to influence public opinion is a useful and appropriate strategy for advancing a ballot campaign. Of course, these campaigns also demand particular attention be given to canvassing in order to collect signatures. Some Intimidating Numbers Collecting enough signatures to get an issue on the ballot can be enormously challenging. Indeed, this may be the more difficult step. In California, for instance, 623,212 signatures are currently required to get a statute on the ballot (an amendment requires 997,139). Campaigns have a limited window of time to collect signatures; California’s 180-day window is typical. If you got every single person in Oakland to sign the petition, you’d be less than 70% of the way there. If every volunteer canvasser collected 100 signatures on average, you’d need well over six thousand volunteers.","text",13
"https://paxfauna.org/report-the-promise-of-direct-democracy-for-momentum-driven-social-movements/","Most campaigns hire a petition company instead. In 2018, the average cost per signature in 2018 was $6.07; the average cost just to get an issue on the ballot was thus over $2.5 million. Of the eight propositions placed on the ballot this way, five were defeated and three passed.","text",14
"https://paxfauna.org/report-the-promise-of-direct-democracy-for-momentum-driven-social-movements/","California requires the largest number of any state, befitting its status as the most populous state. Most states set that threshold as a percentage (typically 5% or 6% for statutes) of the total votes cast for governor or secretary of state in the previous election. In many states, the threshold for putting forward a constitutional amendment is higher than a statute. It may require more signatures or a supermajority of votes. In Colorado, signatures for amendments must be distributed across the state’s 35 senate districts, with 2% of each district signing. This is considered a tremendous hurdle, but it does not apply to statutes, only amendments. Florida, Mississippi, and Illinois only allow amendments. The rules about what laws can be proposed as amendments vs. as statues tend to be vague, and it falls to state regulators and courts to determine whether the proposal is viable. Most Promising States Hereyou can view a table laying out the 24 states which allow voter initiatives. It tracks the number of signatures required and the percentage that number represents of registered voters, along with the window of time each state allows for collecting signatures. I’ve also included different facts about the state which may suggest states more likely to be favorable to our messaging. Animal agriculture is not currently seen as a partisan issue, so in addition to partisan tilt I’ve included measures like urban vs. rural population which may make states more or less hospitable. The ideal state for a ballot initiative campaign would meet the following criteria: Oregon and Colorado stand out as states with moderate signature requirements (112,020; 124,632) and favorable politics. Both have a habit of passing major, nation-leading reforms through ballot measures, especially on non-partisan issues like drug legalization. Both states have Democratic trifectas. Each state’s current signature requirement comprises just under 5% of registered voters (the average is 6.1%).","text",15
"https://paxfauna.org/report-the-promise-of-direct-democracy-for-momentum-driven-social-movements/","Both states have prominent urban areas; Portland in particular has a strong existing activist scene which could be befriended, and which tends to be more friendly towards animal freedom than other progressive scenes. One difference stands out: Colorado hosts a large presence of two of the world’s largest slaughter corporations (Smithfield and JBS), while Oregon’s ag sector is dominated by smallerbeefanddairyoperations. Having a more consolidated slaughter industry as the opponent presents pros and cons. Mainly, Smithfield and JBS are less sympathetic enemies, but they have far more money for an opposition campaign. It’s likely, however, that major slaughter corporations would invest in opposition in any state regardless of whether they operate there.","text",16
"https://paxfauna.org/report-the-promise-of-direct-democracy-for-momentum-driven-social-movements/","Municipal Initiatives The administration of municipal ballot initiatives is more heterogeneous. Each county and city publishes its own guidelines on how many signatures and votes are required. For a rough sense of the scale of municipal ballot campaigns in 2020, Portland required 37,638 signatures; Denver County required 9,788, 2% of registered voters; 2% in Boulder county was 4,908. Clearly, these numbers are much more achievable. For a different route, conservative, agrarian Weld County, CO, home of a massive JBS slaughterhouse, requires just over 4,000; Yuma County, home of a major Smithfield operation, had a total of 6,008registered votersin 2020. Otherwise, the process of registering a voter initiative is essentially the same at the local level as at the state level. Rather than conduct a comprehensive review of these jurisdictions now, Pax Fauna can prepare to efficiently conduct that research when mobilization reaches a significant enough level in specific geographies.

"https://paxfauna.org/beginning-a-practice-in-nonviolent-communication/","These blogs are an attempt to put the content of Eva’s NVC trainings online into a readable format. However, the largest benefit to attending real-time workshops ispractice.As with any skill, reading isn’t enough. What follows are suggestions for practice to be used individually and as a supplement to workshops or practice groups. If you missed them, here are previous blogs in this series. Part One:why we study nonviolence Part Two: thepractice of empathy Part Three: the building blocks of empathy,feelings and needs Part Four:observations and requests The Gist: Start Easy An important consideration for practice:start on easy mode.When attempting to integrate new communication practices, focusing on easier situations can let us get a feel for the skills without getting overwhelmed. It also lets us make mistakes in lower-stakes situations. Practice Alone Every exercise can be done journaling instead of with another person. Writing can be an intentional way to guide yourself through the process to systematically process thoughts and feelings. Practice in Safe Relationships I’ve occasionally heard people say that they tried NVC and it didn’t work. Usually, this means that they came to someone they had a difficult relationship with and said something like, “When you yell at me, I feel frustrated because I have a need for respect.” When the other person didn’t respond differently than they had in the past, the person declared the experiment failed. Of course, NVC doesn’t provide magic words that will make every person you are in conflict with see your point of view. If we consider it, instead, a skill set we can master, its application changes. We don’t say, “Great, something I can use to finally make my estranged mother hear me!” We say, instead, “I’d like to give this a try.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/beginning-a-practice-in-nonviolent-communication/","Maybe, next time my friend tells me about something going on in her life, I can see if she’s okay with me guessing her feelings and needs.” To begin a practice of NVC, I recommend starting by offering empathy (before asking for it) and in relationships that are mostly safe. See if you can identify feelings and needs in day-to-day conversations. Occasionally voice a guess out loud. See what happens. Once empathy becomes a habit, see if you can bring it into more difficult conversations.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/beginning-a-practice-in-nonviolent-communication/","Notice old habits An early step in the practice may just be to notice. What are my tendencies? When someone is telling me about something that bothers them, what is my impulse? Where am I using judgment and where am I using empathy? Notice judgment in your own language. This gives you an opportunity to then replace some of that judgment with observations that are more nonjudgmental. In day-to-day conversations, can you name your own feelings, and connect them to your needs? Nonviolence Starts Inside Self-empathy is a vital prerequisite skill for the application of Nonviolence in our relationships with others. Every exercise we’ll explore includes self-empathy as an initial step becauseit’s really hard to listen if you haven’t been heard.Hearing ourselves first can take some of the pressure off the conversation and give us the capacity to listen to others. Stages of Practice In this piece, we’ll go through a general format for practice. This can be used as a guide for any situation where you’re feeling emotional tension that you’d like to process. Processing tension can prepare you for finding solutions on your own or with others, or can bring acceptance such that no external solutions are needed. Story, Thoughts, and Judgments We’ll talk about some exercises that use an NVC framework to untangle your own experiences. These exercises usually ask you to reflect on your observations, feelings, needs, and requests. Before that, though, it can be helpful to let out your story about the world, in all its judgmental glory. What are we telling ourselves about what happened, about what’s wrong with the other person, about what this all means? We try to only do this in a safe place, like to a journal, a therapist, or a trusted friend. When confiding in a friend about conflicts with people they may know, it’s important to be clear on your intention.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/beginning-a-practice-in-nonviolent-communication/","Try saying something like, “I’m having a hard time with this situation and I want to be able to see it from the other person’s point of view. Before I’m ready to try that, it would be helpful if you could just hear me vent for a moment.” By stating the goal of a supportive conversation—to vent out frustration with the aim of being able to resolve the conflict—we can avoid gossip and side-taking.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/beginning-a-practice-in-nonviolent-communication/","Marshall Rosenberg sometimes used a metaphorical jackal to represent judgmental language, and he’d go so far as to bring puppets to his workshops to illustrate the point. The giraffe was the counterpoint to the jackal and represented NVC consciousness. Silly as it was, the separate puppets helped to draw a clear distinction between the jackal and giraffe consciousness even while making room for each. Observations Once you’ve gotten out any burning judgmental thoughts that were keeping you distracted (“my roommate is a slob!”), what you can try next is writing or stating observations. This is an exercise that can prepare you for a conversation by revealing whatsolution requestsmight meet your needs. For example, if I observe that my roommate left blueberry stains on the floor, it becomes clear that I can request that they wipe the stains immediately next time. Attempting to state observations, when we’re very escalated, can bring out more judgments. Let those come out in your journal or with your practice partner and then find the observation. Feelings Next, write or state all the feelings you had in the moment—as well as the ones you are experiencing now, thinking about it. Those might be pure emotions (sadness, frustration), sensations (chills, knots, heat), or even images or metaphors (ripping paper, a boat in a hurricane). Sometimes, naming feelings results in feelings changing, as if being named lets them know they’ve fulfilled their purpose, or, on the other hand, invites more intensity to arrive for processing. Needs Identify the needs that are alive for you in relation to this situation. As each need emerges, reflect on how it feels to be a person with this need. Feel its importance and the sensation of it being unmet. Repeat Lots of situations need multiple rounds of this reflection process. Continue identifying your judgments, observations, feelings, and needs, until a sense of resolution is reached.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/beginning-a-practice-in-nonviolent-communication/","Returning to the observation, you will hopefully find it less activating to your nervous system on repeated encounters. Once you’ve experienced a shift towards relaxation or peace, move into the last stage: requests.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/beginning-a-practice-in-nonviolent-communication/","Requests Identify: Knowing how to process our own tensions is important, but equally important is knowing how to respond when somebody else is tense toward us. Part Six of this blog series will explore an NVC approach to acknowledging harm when we’ve done something that impacted someone else. Stay tuned and enjoy your NVC practice this week!

"https://paxfauna.org/when-enemies-appear-untangling-our-anger/","These blogs are an attempt to put the content of Eva’s NVC trainings online into a readable format. If you missed them, here are previous blogs in this series. Part One:why we study nonviolence Part Two: thepractice of empathy Part Three: the building blocks of empathy,feelings and needs Part Four:observations and requests Part Five:beginning a practice in NVC The Gist: Anger is powerful and can be a massive force for protection and positive change. But sometimes, anger can feel too big for our bodies to hold without hurting us. Until I discovered this exercise, I was often kept up at night stewing with anger, sometimes toward people whose supposed violations occurred years ago. When I learned this exercise, developed byMiki Kashtan, I resolved to get up out of bed in those moments and journal it. I knew that when I was stuck in these states, something that really calmed me down would be the fastest way to get to sleep, even if it took an hour. I imagined a long future of this strange practice, seeing myself slipping out of shared hotel rooms and coming up with explanations for my 2AM journaling for years to come. After all, this pattern wasstrongand I had a seemingly endless supply of sparks to ignite my late-night smoldering (though generally, when I brought these same situations to mind during the day, they weren’t nearly as charged). I think I got out of bed for the exercise twice in the first couple of weeks, and the pattern hasn’t existed since. I was astonished at the efficiency with which I had untangled my anger at the “enemies” who appeared in the night. You Might Need Your Anger This exercise involves extending silent empathy for someone who’s the object of your anger, in order to soften anger and blame. You don’t need me to tell you not to do it if your anger is helping you in some way, such as by protecting you from returning to an abusive partner. As with all practice, start at a lower intensity to get a sense of how the exercise can work for you.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/when-enemies-appear-untangling-our-anger/","What is it for?","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/when-enemies-appear-untangling-our-anger/","This is a practice that seeks to guide us from blame and anger towards understanding and compassion, even if the other person is no longer accessible. The goal is to experience a softening of fury and an ability to imagine, even if we don’t agree with, another’s perspective. There are two main applications I’m suggesting. Self-Empathy First Before diving into the process of understanding another's perspective, it's crucial to start with yourself. This process is explained in more detail inPart 5. Repeat this self-empathy process anytime you get escalated during the exercise. If we’re working on something that really needs untangling, you’ll probably do this a handful of times. It’s likely that some different observations, feelings, and needs will come up each time. The Other Person's Perspective Once you’ve softened from practicing self-empathy, you can begin to explore the other person's perspective. Even inviting yourself to do this might cue up more anger. If that’s the case, return to self-empathy. When you’re ready, consider the following, paying close attention to any shift in how you’re holding anger and blame. Identify Requests Once you've experienced a shift in your emotional stance, consider any requests you might have of yourself or the other person. These might be internal commitments or external actions, depending on the situation. Recognize that it might not always be possible or necessary to take external action. The practice itself, the shift from blame to understanding, can be a powerful resolution. What if it didn’t work? If your anger still feels escalated after this exercise, consider which needs your anger might be meeting for you. In what ways are you better off for having anger or blame? Is anger protecting you from something dangerous, preserving your sense of dignity, or fueling your work? Allow for the possibility that you can choose anger as a strategy to meet these needs.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/when-enemies-appear-untangling-our-anger/","Softening the Edges ""When Enemies Appear"" is an invitation to travel from the turmoil of blame and anger to a place of understanding and compassion. By starting with self-empathy and then extending that empathy to the other person, we soften our hard edges and open ourselves to connection and understanding. This process is not always easy or quick, but it is a powerful tool for reconciliation. Even when the other person is no longer in our lives, this practice remains relevant for offering a resolution for ourselves.","text",7

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","Stages of Activist Development: A Study of US Animal Rights Organizers My Lonely Vegan Journey I went vegan when I was 13 and rarely met another vegan for the following decade. After high school, I moved from Northern California to Western Michigan to study music. I didn’t have a lot of success connecting with others for the first couple of years. As a vegan, and not to mention a leftist and strident atheist, it was hard to find my people between rehearsals, five hours alone in a practice room daily, and occasional mortifying events put on by the Evangelical Christian student org that I mistook for casual social invitations. I was hopeful during a short stint volunteering with Food Not Bombs, but after they shut down for the first winter, they didn’t start back up again. When I think of my first couple of years of undergrad, the most striking memory is of deafening loneliness. Once, on a rare occasion when I had reason to leave the music building, I was offered a leaflet. Imagine my delight when I saw that it was about veganism! I declined, not wanting this precious sermon to be wasted on the choir, and let him know I was already vegan. He reached into his bag and offered me a second leaflet. This one, I guess, was more focused on recipes. “Are you with a group or something? Is there something I can get involved with?” I asked, probably ready to join literally anything he offered. “No,” he replied. “It’s just me.” I don’t even think we exchanged first names. Fast Forward Today, I help to run Pax Fauna, an organization existing to help the grassroots animal rights movement grow into a political force to be reckoned with and change cultural norms. I’ve worked full-time in the movement for five years and been arrested as many times. I’ve given trainings to hundreds of animal rights activists and organized dozens of demonstrations with attendance of up to a thousand.","text",1
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","I’ve taken the Liberation Pledge, investigated a handful of factory farms, and am proudly facingfeloniesfor my rescue work. Surely, I’m a success case for the people who recruited me, but I’m just one person- anything that worked to help me transition from lonely vegan to seasoned organizer might just be a fluke. Even still, over my years of involvement, my co-organizers and I have often depended on our own experiences in guessing what might work to recruit others.","text",2
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","About this Study Hoping for a more robust understanding of how people become dedicated organizers, my colleagues at Pax Fauna and I designed a study. In it, I interviewed 38 current and former organizers in the animal rights movement. I hoped to learn how they got involved, how they were recruited and by whom, and how they have stayed motivated despite the enormity of the cultural forces we’re up against. I was also curious about the factors influencing their decision or temptation to quit the movement. In this report, I share what I learned about what it’s like to be an animal rights organizer as well as advice on how organizers and groups can better recruit and retain activists. This study follows in the footsteps of a 2020 survey experiment byFaunalytics, which surveyed 167 paid and unpaid animal advocates on many factors affecting retention. Methods Study participants dedicated significant amounts of time to the movement on a volunteer basis. Only organizers who dedicated at least five hours a week over at least six months were included, but most participants spent much more time, with eight describing a period of time in which they dedicated 40 or more unpaid hours per week over several months. Their involvement, which was sometimes later paid work, lasted anywhere from nine months to over twenty years, with most having gotten involved in the early to mid 2010s and sustained their involvement for five or more years. They participated in the movement in a volunteer capacity well beyond attending events- by organizing demonstrations themselves, and in some cases community events, Veg Fests, trainings, and conferences. They had a variety of organizational affiliations, and most participants worked with multiple organizations throughout the course of their careers. Of 38 study participants, two did not complete a demographic survey sent after the interview. 13 identified as male, four as genderqueer or nonbinary, and 19 as woman or female.","text",3
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","12 participants listed a non-white racial or ethnic identity.  One participant declined to state a racial or ethnic identity. All gender/sex and race/ethnicity data is available in the Appendix.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","Participants’ highest level of education completed was highschool or equivalent (1), an Associate’s Degree (1), some college (10), a Bachelor’s degree (10), a Master’s degree (12), and a PhD or higher (1). Participants were aged 22-27 (5), 28-34 (8), 35-39 (9), 40s (5), 50s (4) 60s (3) and 70s (1). After the first interview, I excluded people whose first organizing experience was with the group DxE SF Bay Area because of their large size and organizational capacity. The reason for this is that I assume that getting involved in DxE in the Bay Area is substantively different than in most other places in the US. While I hope that findings from this study will be applicable to DxE SF Bay, I worried that including people they recruited could give me a nearly endless supply of participants without easily producing insights applicable to organizers in areas that don’t already have a robust animal rights community and systems in place to engage newer activists. I also excluded people who I worked closely with during my time organizing for DxE SF Bay Area, even those who had joined the movement elsewhere. The reasoning behind this was that whether or not I took the time to interview them, what I knew of their experiences was sure to inform the study. I chose instead to prioritize including people whom I hadn't worked with previously, and only included past collaborators when our interactions had been minimal (e.g., we both played roles in an event and didn't attend regular organizing meetings together). Finally, I limited the study to people who got involved in organizing in the United States and people who identify as vegan. Veganism was a stand-in for holding a holistic orientation to animal justice, meant to exclude people with more niche interests in animal issues, such as those who were involved in circus, fur, or animal testing campaigns without supporting animal freedom more broadly.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","That said, I did include the experiences of activists whose primary work was on such campaigns within the context of a holistic, vegan orientation.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","I used snowball sampling to select potential participants in the study: after assembling a list of organizers known to myself and my colleagues at Pax Fauna, I asked each participant to recommend others who would be appropriate for the study. I sent a single invitation to join the study to most of the activists who were referred. Invitations were sent via email, Signal, Whatsapp, Instagram, and Facebook. Sometimes I wrote “cold messages” over social media and occasionally I was connected by another study participant. Data saturation was the metric used to decide when the study was over: when the vast majority of ideas communicated in each new interview had also been discussed in previous interviews, that would signal I was nearing the end of data collection. While coding interviews, specific ideas relevant to the research question were identified through tags. Data saturation was identified when the creation of new tags slowed or stopped for several interviews in a row. At that point, I completed the interviews that were already scheduled and sent a final set of invitations to several people whose experiences were less represented by participants already included- people who had served time in prison or who represented geographies not yet included. Out of the 38 organizers I interviewed, 11 were initial seed participants who weren’t referred by another participant but instead were on a list built by Pax Fauna’s team and advisors. Only 9 were people whom I didn’t know personally before the study began. In contrast, 36 people were invited to participate in the study but did not schedule an interview, 23 of whom were people previously unknown to me. The difficulty in recruiting study participants outside of my personal network certainly represents a limitation of this sampling method. With that limitation in mind, my findings should be understood as descriptive of a particular piece of the grassroots movement in the US and not exhaustive of advocates’ experiences.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","Future research of this kind should consider offering an incentive to study participants to avoid over-relying on the researchers’ personal connections, making greater use of introductions by referring participants, and sending follow-up invitations to participants who have yet to respond.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","Even so, the study included organizers living in California, North Carolina, Illinois, Utah, Wisconsin, Arizona, Missouri, Texas, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Colorado, and Michigan. Participants worked on issues related to animals used for food, testing, and entertainment, including circuses and zoos. About 13 were no longer involved in the movement at the time of their interviews. Interviews were conducted between August 2022 and January 2023. I promised confidentiality to participants, except to the extent that they preferred to be credited for their quotes. When direct quotes are relayed here, I sent the quote to the participant it came from and asked whether they’d like to be named in relation to the quote. If no response was received, the quote is relayed anonymously. If an anonymous participant’s primary organizational affiliation is ambiguous or they belong to a small group, they’re referred to only as “animal rights organizer.” Otherwise, their primary or self-selected organizational affiliation is named. I conducted each interview on Zoom and transcribed them using the software Otter.ai. Each automatically generated transcript was reviewed for errors and corrected by a volunteer or me. It was then uploaded into the qualitative research coding software, Taguette, where I used inductive thematic analysis to identify themes. Vocabulary In this piece, I refer to “activists” as an umbrella term for anyone involved in the movement on a volunteer basis. Advocacy groups are abbreviated DxE for Direct Action Everywhere, “AV” for Anonymous for the Voiceless, “Save” for The Save Movement, “Compassionate PDX” for a chapter of the Compassionate Cities Network in Portland, Oregon, and “ARC PDX” for a local group in Portland. “Organizer” in this piece refers to anyone interested in recruiting and developing more activists.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","“Organization” is any group of activists who work together, but especially refers to international advocacy groups that financially support some organizers, such as DxE, Save, and AV. “Chapter” is sometimes used to specifically refer to a small group of activists who work in a particular locality, especially as a subgroup of an international organization.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","Stages of Activist Development Participants in this study made the rare decision to devote hundreds of unpaid hours to a movement with arguably little public support. They spent their own money on the work, suffered the loss or distancing of many relationships, and faced arrest and criminal charges. While I find these people extremely special, I very much want to believe that they aren’t. After all, while participants occasionally started their stories in relation to some trait they always had, such as being a planner, a peacemaker, an animal lover, a leader, or someone who stands up to injustice, I didn’t notice any trends in which traits they cited or exhibited that would help explain their dedication. Hearing the stories of so many organizers, I started to conceive of a process by which we transition from “randos” (an affection term for the not-yet activists we’d like to recruit) into seasoned, dedicated organizers. This report offers a framework for understanding the development of an activist. Early in the process of developing this model, I realized that the process seemed to share some uncanny parallels with the Stages of Grief as conceived by the psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross. Similar to the Stages of Grief, these are not linear steps- activists experience multiple stages in the same time period, experience them in a different order than listed here, or experience the same stage multiple times. Importantly, each stage has distinct needs that more veteran organizers can help to meet- challenges that, if not overcome, could result in burnout, conflict, dropping out of the movement, or all three. While assembling this report, I stopped thinking of it as just a neat parallel to the Stages of Grief, and instead began to consider it a literal grief process, experienced by people who were exposed to the true horror of animal agriculture and who found a way to live in the world despite it.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","I’m using alternate names for the stages to better reflect the language the study participants used, but they can also be understood as manifestations of the Stages of Grief.","text",12
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","After conducting dozens of interviews with animal rights organizers,  I feel a heart-wrenching wistfulness around my interaction with the leafleter when I was in college. On one hand, I wish I had been as self-motivated and confident as many of the organizers I talked to, or even the man leafleting at Western Michigan University around 2010. (Can anyone put me in touch?) On the other, I wish that I could have sooner been invited to participate in meaningful work for animals. I, like many of the study participants, feel changed by the work- empowered, more confident, and more able to animate purpose in my life. When I think of the person I was in college, Isowant that for her. When I think of would-be activists who have yet to join the movement, I want that for them, too. The following quotes represent participants’ experiences of being changed by movement work. “I felt like I finally had a reason to be around and I could finally express my purpose. I just started seeing myself change and grow and evolve in ways I never thought I could. Because, you know, I'm just a girl from South [city], I'm not supposed to be doing these great grand things. When I got into activism, I started seeing myself more as someone worthy, who has these abilities, and who people can respect, which is not something I ever thought I could say for myself, and so that just changed my entire being.” “I think I would have been someone who was not as fluent at being able to assess and discuss who I am and why I do the things I do without this work. I think that this has made me a stronger person.” “A little bit more of a sense of being free in the world. Like, you can go protest somewhere, you can go walk onto a property if you want to, there's some sense of freedom there. You know, being a little bit able to go outside of the bounds.” “I think I'm more outgoing, and better at engaging with strangers.","text",13
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","And new people in general, especially with petitioning, kind of being forced to constantly interact with strangers in a very abrupt way. I think I've had some carryover in my ability to do that with just any stranger outside of activism.”","text",14
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","Powerlessness Kübler-Ross Stage: Denial What it is In the beginning, we weren’t activists. We were skeptical that we could do anything about the problem and, at points, didn’t feel particularly obligated. We might largely put the issue out of our minds for months or years at a time. We look back on this time with regret for not getting active sooner. What it’s like Some participants described a time when they wanted to get involved, but they were shy. They didn’t know what to do and didn’t know anything that was going on around them. They joined when invited, but even then it sometimes took a little bit of coaxing to get on board. Rare exceptions got involved in the movement in some other way- first attending protests for other causes where they met animal rights organizers or by attending an animal testing or circus protest before going vegan. “I was basically the silent, non pushy vegan. Just, I'm vegan, and that's good enough. On Facebook, I had been seeing the DxE disruption videos from the local chapter here in Seattle. And at first, I was hesitant. ‘That's not my thing. I don't even know if that's a good idea.’” What we need Barriers to involvement, internal and external, need to be overcome. In this stage, would-be activists need lots of social exposure to make activism seem fun, popular, and like something someone like them would do. They need invitations to demystify activism and participate in an extremely low-pressure way, such as by watching a demonstration without being a visible part of it, or attending a community event where they can meet other activists and see that they are normal, often-introverted people just like them. Outreach events should take care to give opportunities to stay in touch and plug in, even when outreach is for a purpose besides recruiting activists, such as AV cubes and petitioning. Be liberal in distributing your contact information (or, better yet, collect theirs) and sending invitations to the next social event.","text",15
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","On that note, make sure there alwaysisa next social event on the calendar to invite them to. Savvy organizers have systems in place to remember to stay in touch with newcomers and regular participants alike.","text",16
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","As written about in Harie Han’s 2014 book,How Organizations Develop Activists,it does seem that participants often got involved during transitions in their lives, including moving, finishing school, death of a loved one, a breakup, or going vegan. It’ll be no surprise to suggest that organizers try to recruit college and high school students, who live in close proximity to big transitions. A note on low-pressure ways to get involved: seasoned organizers might be naturally fearless, or have calibrated our nervous systems in such a way that we forget what it was like to be brand new. Sometimes the first step we think to offer is, to a would-be activist, terrifying. For example, standing in an AV cube wearing a mask and holding a TV was cited by several people as something that seemed too scary for them, at first. These activists were quickly able to move up a ladder of engagement and do thingsmuchhigher pressure than standing in a Cube, but only after dipping their toe in by showing up to watch a cube or demonstration without needing to participate. Two participants describedwatchingan action as their first involvement, and one initially decided to do so covertly, without telling anyone she was coming. Organizers are encouraged to invite people to shadow or watch advocacy work without pressure to get more involved before they’re ready. This will allow them to, in addition to watching, get to know the other advocates and demystify involvement.","text",17

All I really wanted from the activist who recruited me was someone to complain to about people whodon’t get it.

The transition into regular involvement and identifying with the movement can be transformative “When you're starting from scratch, you don't even know this whole process of identifying a problem and coming up with a campaign, identifying stakeholders. It's all very foreign and strange. So, I was lucky to find a good community the first time I reached out.” Anger Kübler-Ross Stage: Anger What it is Again, these steps are not linear: anger might accompany, precede, or followpowerlessness. In this stage, it overwhelms us hownot okaythe system is, and how people we love and respect continue to participate in it. “I was getting really angry, and I wasn't processing it well, but I was taking screenshots of all these quotes about why we shouldn't kill animals and sending it into the Slack channel unannounced all the time. And then getting into arguments with people. I left because no one else was supportive. I was also not communicating in a way where they would have been likely to be supportive.” What it’s like We might demonize individuals who continue to eat animals or vegans who aren’t activists. When we do find activists who first inspire but later disappoint us, that same demonizing impulse might be applied to them. Without hope, anger can be self-destructive- not to mention destructive to our relationships, communities, and others. We can even feel left out of regular channels of addressing mental health, given how few people in the helping professions- and the population, at large- share our worldview. “I went vegan that night. I was just mad. I went to bed angry knowing what was going on. I was so mad at myself.” “I think I was pretty angry at the beginning.","text",19

After that, activists need guidance in and exposure to strong norms around Nonviolence to allow us to channel our energy into outlets that are productive and non-harmful. “It's unfortunate that you have to get that angry. But I try to direct that into action. And whether or not that action is even successful at some times doesn't matter. Doing anything feels better than doing nothing.” Where we go from here Anger can stick around for a long time, and without positive experiences of working with a group, our unsuccessful attempts to change things can lead us intodefeat. Experiences of belonging in movement groups can allow us to channel the high energy of this stage intopassion,while a deep practice of Nonviolence can transform ourangerintowisdom. By adopting a nonviolent worldview, we challenge ourselves to stop using blame as a vehicle for understanding the world. Without bad people, no one can be dismissed. When we start to believe that regular, traumatized people do horrific things out of a desperate attempt to meet valid needs, we open ourselves towards understanding the complexity of the system we’re fighting. From this place, we can experience a righteous and protective anger more focused on the needs of the victims than the crimes of the perpetrators.

You know, I'll go, I'll hold the signs, I'll do the chants, I’ll do the marches. It seemed like it required the least amount of effort and capability, because I wasn't sure what I was capable of, and I was a little bit nervous. And I was attending those monthly ARCPDX meetings regularly. And during the meetings, they announced that there was a need for organizing.” “It was so profound that I was like, I can't not do this. I need to keep doing this… And I was like, ‘You know, I'm retired, so I'm a body- use me… It just kind of snowballed. The community and the connections were just amazing.” “From then on, when things came up, I was always trying to get involved with it- different protests or actions or demonstrations. It just felt like the right thing to do, being a voice for the animals.” Or, the task at hand might seem insanely simple, and we may be overly ambitious, not having yet experienced failure in the work. “After that, it became so simple and obvious to me, because I was so naive… ‘All I have to do is tell people, and everybody will change.’” “I innocently innocuously thought well, … once you all see what I've learned then you'll go vegan too- you'll be a voice for animals too… obviously, that couldn't have been further from the case. And that was heartbreaking.” A handful of participants seemed to recruitthemselvesto the movement- organizing their own protests from scratch or starting chapters of national or international organizations with only reluctant cooperation from those larger hubs. These highly motivated people learned about the horrors of animal agriculture andhadto do something, fast. They seemed to skip thepowerlessstage entirely. “I'm like, ‘I have to tell the world about this. I need everyone to know.’ So I searched around in [city]  to find activism.

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","“None of those groups that popped up- nobody emailed me back. So I'm just like, ‘Nobody's doing activism here. Oh my God, I should just start doing it!’ I don't know why- I think I was just angry. And I felt helpless and wanted to do something about it.” What it’s like Amazing. We’re full of energy and ready to get to work. In the hands of organizers we trust, we experience a huge influx of meaning and purpose. We might lionize the organizers we become aware of, and outsiders who witness this dynamic might worry about us and see it as cult-like. We don’t really care- we’re ecstatic at finally finding a community of people who share our values. “My first impression was like, ‘Wow, these guys are really cool. Like, they know what they're doing. Like, I'm just showing up. I hope they don't think I'm a weirdo or a rando, because I don't know any of them.’ But it's like, ‘hey, I want to do this, too… Whatever they say, I'm gonna do.’ I just wanted to learn as much as I could from them. And I was just really impressed with the depth of their knowledge of activism” Some people found ways to work full-time without being paid- sometimes intentionally, by saving money, retiring from paid work, or by accepting the support of a partner. Sometimes they didn’t think of activism as full-time at all- putting in many hours along with working or going to school. These full-time hours in addition to other responsibilities were generally short-lived. While some people cited a sense of pressure from others, in general advocates seemed self-motivated in periods of high engagement. “Looking back at the beginning, I don't know how the hell I was doing all the stuff I was doing. Like I had unlimited energy… It caused a lot of strain on my prior relationships. But to me, it was worth it. I just wish I would have approached it a little bit differently back then.” “I definitely practiced my activism unsustainably at the beginning, I was just totally into doing anything.","text",25

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","Meaningful Work Organizers can care for new activists by giving them credible and meaningful ways to make real change in the world. Make sure they understand why their work is important. Celebrate positive outcomes, no matter how small. In this stage, it’s particularly important for organizers to give away work that encourages activists to grow their capacity. Don’t let people get stuck in low levels of engagement. Encourage activists to contribute in ways that stretch their capacity and force them to gain skills. “I was always trying to find more- anything else to achieve or something else to try. … I want to learn about the thing. It's exciting to navigate this organization.” “[The organizer is] very friendly, super warm. She would identify people, and she would know what you were really good at, and she would encourage you to do that. She would be like, ‘Oh, you like drawing! You should make all of our signs next time!’ or ‘You should lead our sign making workshop…’ She was very good at seeing people with their talents and guiding them into work with the organization in some way.” “I would do a speak out or I'd lead chants and then I'd say, ‘Who hasn't done it before that just thinks you can't do it?’ like right in the middle sometimes- you gotta catch them right then because if you say to sign up to do a thing they're not going to.” Get them up to speed such that they not only understand your theory of change, but can meaningfully contribute to direction-setting. Understand that time spent developing newer activists is time growing your group’s- and the movement’s- capacity to do work in the future. Norms of Self-Care Understand that while high levels of engagement can be joyful, eventually, they can lead to burnout. Encourage breaks, vacations, maintaining relationships outside the movement, and self-care. Sometimes, norms of poor self-care can exist in a community without anyone meaning to create them. Correct them when you notice their cues.","text",27
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","One example of this used by a participant was when an organizer would talk about the urgency of the problem of animal agriculture as a way to motivate others. Another example of this may be an organizer regularly talking about how little sleep they get as a way to explain away poor performance. While it can be appropriate to receive emotional support from co-organizers on either of these topics, beware of making light of poor self care or citing urgency as a way to demand more or better work. These can create a culture of overworking that will lead to burnout- and burnout means less work gets done over time, not more. Instead, leaders should be role models of a healthy balance between the movement and other parts of their lives.","text",28
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","“There was a time where I was probably putting a little bit too much work into it, a little bit too much time spent every single day… I was starting to feel really burnt out. I also felt like there was kind of a sense within the little organizer cluster of us that we weren't doing enough. And in reality, we had ramped up our efforts quite a bit. We were doing protests at least once a week, if not twice a week, which is a lot for a spread out city to do.” Positive Thinking When describing the most inspiring moments in participants’ careers, a wide range of stories came up, generally describing some kind of success or show of movement power. Interestingly, sometimes, one person’s most inspiring moment is another’s least. On several occasions, amostinspiring moment for one participant was described by another as a low point or as an example of leadership’s misstep, such as a particularly controversialDxE disruption. In another few instances, a participant who was asked about a high or low point of their activism used one story to relay both a high and low point. These point to the power of framing outcomes as victorious and focusing on the positive impacts of actions, even when they didn’t go according to plan. “One vigil…there was a lot of a low feeling, down feeling because we didn't see any trucks at all. At the end of the vigil, during the debrief, Connie [Pearson]’s like “See, look!” She turned it into a positive. She told the people attending, “that means that we're having an effect.” I forgot exactly what she said but she made it feel good. She had that kind of a quality, just good with words and making people feel good about anything.” While this advice on framing outcomes as victories has been written about before, I always thought of this as something I didforother activists. I thought that I was supposed to manage my feelings of defeat privately, and then report back to others that we were winning and this was why.","text",29
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","What I heard participants do, when they ended their story about a low point in a high point, was turn the power of that victory framing onthemselves.","text",30
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","An example of this was Cordelia Stone, when asked about a low point in organizing, described an AV Cube event that, despite her best attempts at promotion, drew out no volunteers besides her partner. She went ahead with the two person event and described a successful event with numerous meaningful conversations. Another example was Amber Canavan, citing a Veg Fest she organized with low turnout, which then inspired someone to organize a more successful event in the same city. “I think a lot of activism stuff has one of those secret silver linings, where even if something fails, sometimes it can inspire other people to do it right or do it better.” Surely, organizers are also activists, and caring for our own motivation is a smart way to care for others. I want to be clear that these victory framings were not delusional- organizers were articulate in where their political losses lay and what they would like to have done differently. The surprising cognitive tactic was in how fully they celebrated the victories within the defeats. “It feels like it's all worth it, all of the stress, everything is all worth it. So I take the little achievements, the little bright spots, and I try to maximize them, and I remember them.” Patience: Let puppies gnaw on your hands sometimes Rather than the extreme humility described above, some new activists instead present with insufferable puppy energy. They have a million ideas and many of them are pretty bad. They might seem a little too interested in the more glamorous roles. They’re blowing up the group chat and generally coming on way too strong. Activists in this stage need, most of all, patience. Resist the urge to take it personally or suggest that they might be infiltrators. You might notice thoughts like, “They’re really overstepping”, “This person doesn’t seem to respect me”, “Why wasn’t I consulted first?” and “They’re trying to take over.” While frustration is understandable, do your best to assume good intentions.","text",31

I think I was just like, ‘I want to see animal liberation.’ So I'm just gonna do as many different campaigns as I can until we achieve it.” Celebrate their desire to contribute, and hold that celebration while you give them feedback if their behavior is making it hard to work with them, help to develop their ideas if they aren’t in line with your organizational values, and encourage them to learn more about Nonviolence and your theory of change. As discussed in more depth later on, organizationsmusthave a conflict resolution policy. Intervene early and often to resolve tensions involving enthusiastic new activists.  Imagine the patience you’d like to extend to a new puppy who needs to learn both that humans are safe and shoes aren’t for chewing. The biggest trend noticed when hearing descriptions of the process by which an activist went from just showing up at events to taking on an organizing role was simply that the organizers needed help, such as when a previous organizer quit. Savvy organizers should be looking for ways to build movement capacity for its own sake and moving activists up a ladder of engagement. There is no reason to wait until you feel a pressing need to ask for help; remember that your invitation to do more work may be a crucial moment in someone’s relationship with the movement. “We were like, ‘We'd love to help out, whatever you guys need.’ And then I learned that they were wanting to retire and step back. And that was a great opportunity. I was like, ‘I can help out with that.’” “Sometimes I was sort of the person who stepped up when a previous organizer stepped down… and then there would be a vacuum. And I'd be like, ‘Well, I don't want this to just stop. So I guess I'll do this, even though I don't really want to.’” “I think I was coming in during a time that some people were getting burned out.","text",33

So I wasn't the main organizer, but I loved it. I was like, ‘Yeah, anything I can do.’ It felt good to be included in any way that I could.” “There are just so many ways to get people involved. Even if it's printing out the chant sheets and bringing the signs.” Where we go from here Given loving mentorship, support in conflict resolution, increasingly difficult tasks that grow their capacity, and real ownership over work, activists can grow smoothly frompassiontowisdom. “I do feel like you can do more with your time if you're part of a campaign documenting any animal abuse or health code violations that can lead to legislation. I got it instantly. I was like, ‘Yeah, I want to do more than just standing here holding a sign and just feeling sick to my stomach…I want to get more involved in this movement. I want to take on more responsibility.’ And so I started taking whatever they gave me.” Most of us are not so lucky. Our high engagement leads to burnout or we run into a range of other pitfalls, and ourpassiontransforms todefeat. “That really opened my eyes to the power of that, and what could be achieved doing activism, and I became really passionate about it. And then I also started volunteering at the Animal Save chapter here. And about a year into that I became co-organizer, and had a lot of big plans. But then the pandemic hit.” Defeat Kübler-Ross Stage: Depression What it is Without a sense that we are able to be a meaningful part of a solution, we disengage. This happens when a would-be activist isn’t able to find allies, after a major political loss, or after our activism is paused for any reason. Perhaps our co-organizers moved away, our chapter dissolved in conflict, or we lost access to opportunities to organize due to personal or societal reasons, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Organizers often describe burnout at this stage, that they were working so hard- and for what?","text",35
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","This stage can come about when we’ve matured out ofpassionand found ourselves disillusioned with the work, the leadership or the structure of our organizations.

There were so many people- I don't know where they are anymore. Like, do they still live here? And they're just, like, living? Did they move away?... I think, from local to national, it's like starting from scratch post-pandemic, if we are even post-pandemic at this point.” What it’s like The work that used to be meaningful just isn’t anymore. Activists lack a sense of purpose and don’t feel motivated to keep going. “That is really hard for people who are just coming in. They need to feel like they're accomplishing something. And I don't think that a lot of organizations are giving that to them right now, so they can feel like they were part of a win to keep them going to the next thing.” “I'm pausing all of my volunteer things. And I'm going to stop and think about how I can be more effective and use my time in a way that feels more rewarding.” “So, after high school, that was such a negative experience in terms of what I thought of the efficacy of speaking out, that in college, I really didn't speak out or try to be very proactive.” Without feeling accompanied and supported in the work, a supply of energy that seemed endless at first can quickly run dry. “[There is a] lack of community outside of activism and doing things together to build relationships. And resistance within my local vegan groups here online. I would be posting stuff saying, ‘Hey, this is happening. We're doing this, we're doing this,’ and I got such little support for a long time that I just got to the point where I felt like I was just being truly ignored. And it was like, ‘Okay, I thought I could sustain that without caring.’ But eventually, I got burned out.” After losing community, defeat is felt deeply. We’re shaken to our very sense of purpose in the world. Burnout manifests as a felt sense of not being okay in our own bodies. The low point of participants’ activism, I suspect, was often the low point of their lives.","text",37

Like, is it even going to matter?... I think before I would have just tackled it and been like, ‘Oh, okay, gotta just get over this, no problem. Big deal’ Like, let's do it.’ And now it's just like, ugh.” “So in 2020, you know, with everything locking down, I was kind of forced to face everything that I had been seeing, because I was doing investigations and seen countless investigations and I wasn't doing any self care at all. Just go go go go go. And I had really bad panic disorder, to the point where almost every day I was having a panic attack. I was dissociating. My fiance had to take me to the hospital because I was convinced I was going to die that night. I couldn't fall asleep. Whenever I would feel myself falling asleep, I had to snap back up because I was like, ‘If you close your eyes, you're not going to wake up.’ That was the lowest point. I didn't think I would get out of that. I was convinced that this was how my life was going to be for the rest of my life. But fortunately, I got out of that mindset. And it took about a solid year for me to heal myself. But I just- I didn't take the breaks that I knew I needed and that was the end result.” We wonder if our actions are actually making a difference and soberly consider that they might not be.

And let's do a vigil here…’ It's all kind of motivating because you kind of get that high of thinking that you’ll maybe accomplish something, but then nothing was really seen through. So that part is kind of deflating.” Some participants described this sense of defeat as always on their doorstep, and their involvement as an insurance against it. Strong community can provide a protective effect for activists with exposure to hard facts about the world. “I just feel it's so easy to fall into despair, I think. I would say that in some of the times where I've stopped some activism work, it's because I fell into despair. Just feeling like it's just not accomplishable or just that you had overwhelming opposition.” “That was really hard because I got a lot of backlash and was not supported by my family. But I was so supported by fellow activists and it just made me want to do more activism. It definitely helped me get out of a negative space.” What we need This is another reason why organizers should focus on building up more organizers. Is your organizing team ready to lose a few people to changing life circumstances? If so, the loss of some organizers might be the impetus other activists need to step up. If not, it could trigger defeat in those who stay. In this stage, activists need invitations to bigger and better things. We need to know that the movement is getting smarter and not just repeating the same tactics that aren’t giving us the results we want.

While this study only examined 38 people directly, I suspect that the pandemic pushed hundreds or thousands into this stage- activists who still have some connection to the movement, and who are willing to come back to work if we can offer them something worth coming backfor. Paid work was sometimes talked about like a top level of involvement. Some had mixed feelings about taking paid work, worrying that money could be better spent elsewhere. Some dismissed the idea of working in the movement because of low pay available, and others didn’t believe that paid work was available for someone with their skill set. A 2020studyby Faunalytics documented the rates at which paid advocates left, or considered, leaving their roles due to low pay.

What is is In this stage, we hold a sober view of what the world is like and our part in changing it, however small. We’ve grieved for the way the world is- that it isn’t as easy to change as we previously hoped. We’ve grieved for the distance our movement involvement has inserted into our closest relationships. And we’ve grieved for the relationships we’ve lost due to intermovement conflict. Grief might be forever, to some extent, but at this stage it’s largely integrated. “I still have this warmth and this idea that maybe someday, we'll come back together, like when we're older and when feelings have calmed down, and we can put that aside. We were young and angry. Maybe we can at least just appreciate what we did build together for a minute. I have this daydream of everyone coming back together and singing Kumbaya around the campfire, like, in our 50s or something. But I won't hold my breath.” What it’s like Peace with how the world is Participants who were still involved in the movement could all identify self-talk they use to motivate their continued involvement. What can we do now, in order to be able to do tomorrow what we are unable to do today? “Use the disappointments we encounter as opportunities to learn and grow ourselves, each other, and the movement. Our efforts are going to be a part of history… just as we're standing on the shoulders of those who came before us, newer folks will stand on ours.","text",45

But then I also keep in mind that every little thing that I do to help animals, even if it's one animal, is worth it, which is a huge thing to keep in mind. Even one animal's life that's been changed for the better is worth it to me.” “So also, if I start feeling that way, then I try to reconsider, like, ‘Okay, am I doing everything in my power to be able to make change?... I almost try to flip it into a motivating factor. Like, this is such a huge problem. I need to devote as much as I possibly can, am I doing that, then?” “I cannot single-handedly stop factory farming. Maybe it'll happen 100 years after I die or whatever. But I'm confident that it will happen, because the cognitive dissonance is just too gigantic.” Acting in our own integrity regardless of the outcomes “Let's just say it wasn't possible, and it's not going to change anything. Me sitting and crying and being depressed doesn't make me feel better. Even if it is just a selfish thing, it's an outlet. It's like therapy, I'm gonna go out there and yell or I'm gonna go to a city council meeting and at least try to change some shit. I think that's the biggest thing- people just don't think it's possible, so they don't even want to try.” “Regardless of how big this problem is, and how seemingly little impact that we might have, it's about being a part of something greater than myself. It's about being a part of a movement for people who are oppressed beyond belief. We just have to do something for them.

And not focusing so much on getting lost in the future at all- making plans is not getting lost in the future.

They’ve largely made peace with it. “I have come to terms with the idea that I will never see the future that I'm fighting for. That has taken lots of lots of self-therapy, lots of self-healing. Me as a teenager, I was very much fighting for a future where I would be able to live, where everyone's vegan, and everyone understands the plight of animals in all directions, all the way down to plankton, and it's taken me a long time to kind of come to terms with that… But as long as it keeps improving, then that's where my satisfaction is.” “I try to remember that you're not going to see the impact that you're making right away and I try to think that the action that we take is going to be relative over time.

There are so many people who are doing everything that they can, and I find that really motivational.” “It's nourishing now, just being among my people, our people. I mean, I'm sure you get it. They see the world as I do and that is a huge effing thing.” “I think what also helps is having community, being part of community, whether online or in person or both, having friends who are vegan… All of that sustains my veganism and my being involved as an advocate.” Drops in the bucket Organizers express peace with their relatively small contribution to a larger cause. They know that even though their names won’t be in the history books, their lives have meaning because of the work they’re doing. “I may not know the impact, whether it's a social media post or an event or something, that someone may access. That may be part of what changes their mind and heart, and I just may never know it. So I think that the unknown of it, so to speak, also keeps me going.” “So try to find ways that you feel like you can contribute… just be more drops of water in the bucket. You're never going to be the bucket, yourself. You're not going to be the one who fucking figures out the puzzle and unlocks animal liberation. None of us are, we're all just one piece of a puzzle.” Grieving lost relationships Study participants understand that it takes a lot of energy to engage with their loved ones about the issue of animal agriculture.

With my family, I just don't talk about it very much… My mother has never been to an event I have done, and I have done hundreds."" “Being in a bubble helps. As much as I do think it can be a bad thing… it definitely does help.” “Yeah, I think that one of the big selling points for veganism often is that marketing. Like, nothing will change, you'll eat the same foods, people will totally respect your choice, whatever that means. Everything will be the same and your relationships won't change. And I think that was just not the case for me.” Many refused to identify themselves asradical,insisting that their views arereasonableand that opposing animal rights is actually extreme. Even so, participants often discussed loss of family relationships and friendships in relation to the movement. We wish that our family and friends saw the issue through our eyes or would make minor accommodations to make us comfortable. While advocates responded to these situations in a variety of ways- by participating in relationships in a perfunctory way, disengaging in them all together, or by seeking closeness that worked around their differences- some expression of this grief was made by nearly every participant. “I became a really, you know, the term ‘angry vegan.’ So I was trying to distance myself from them, trying to prove a point, like, if you're not going to be vegan, I'm not going to eat with you, and all of these things. And I think that really damaged our relationship. But now I'm at the point where I'm like, I can't physically force you to do anything. All I can do is encourage you. And now they’re both eating more plant based. So I wish I would have done that so long ago.","text",53

They often described a kind of peace-keeping silence that they relaxed into, where a large part of the participants’ lives isn’t discussed with family. When estrangement was described, it was attributed to causes outside the movement. “Now that I'm at that level of processing, I've been able to engage in an amicable relationship with my mom, even though I think there's always going to be a little bit of a sadness, maybe. But initially it was more frustration.” “I just think it's sad that they're missing out on an opportunity to be part of my life… So I think if you can mourn the loss of the family that… you need and deserve, that is helpful. And then you kind of figure out, where can I connect with them?” Most participants- even those no longer involved in the movement- count other vegans or activists as their closest friends, but still maintain some relationships with nonvegans. Close nonvegan friends discussed by study participants were almost exclusively relationships that started prior to participants’ involvement in activism. In general,veganismwas seen as a bigger factor alienating participants from their families and friends than activism, even for participants who had been arrested, spent time in jail, abandoned lucrative careers, or moved for activism. Some participants expressed a sense that they feellessalienated than they did before starting movement work, citing how their involvement (especially arrest or taking full-time work) led to greater respect from their families, and gratitude for feeling a sense of belonging in their activist communities.

At one point, one of my uncles tried to bring a non-vegan cake into the house. And my mom said, ‘No, you have to put that back in the car. You're not welcome inside,’ because it was at her house, the party. And so I was very proud. She loves me very much.” What we need, once we’ve been through it all Inspiration Participants found certain kinds of activism incredibly thrilling, inspiring, or fun. They were aware that activism feeling good didn’t necessarily mean they were being effective, but spoke with awe about certain experiences- mass open rescue, disruptions, or anything involving joining together with many other vegans or activists. “It was really inspiring being surrounded by like-minded people. Then after that, there were some other big DxE actions… all the really big actions, like where the cameras are. Definitely really inspiring, the rescues too…I think that stuff's really inspiring not just for me, but for everyone.” “When the adrenaline starts kicking in, there's no more fear. You're just in the zone and you're not thinking about consequences of anything. You're just like, ‘Yeah, I'm in it all the way’ and I was ready to go onto the stage.” “I would say the first thing that comes to mind is the open rescue that was at the 2018 Animal Liberation conference, because I had never seen anything like that in my entire life. I want to cry thinking about it… just to see all of these people from all over the world come together and literally save lives.","text",57

And all these people are vegan.’ There were probably, like, 10 of us, but it just felt like it felt like a mini ALC for me. And it was a really good feeling.” Participants often described a shift in their activism from what they saw as fun to what they saw as effective. “I think I got a lot out of [cubes]- that sort of epiphany that people would go through, because that's what I went through. And you want to give that to other people. So, I don't always necessarily feel that just sending emails and clicking through menus. I struggle with that with the legislative activism. too. It's less direct. You don't get that dopamine hit after sending an email. It's more long term, sort of slow, but you want to do what's ultimately effective” Based on the frequency of participants’ discussion of conferences as inspirational moments, the movement can certainly justify investing more resources in getting people together, especially in regional gatherings with less of a barrier to entry to newer grassroots activists. “It kind of sucks that you have to be more strategic and a little bit more methodical, and maybe a little less fun. But that's kind of the shift I've been going through… I'm definitely going to ALC. I hope there's going to be a rescue or something. That'd be awesome. Just more from the big, flashy, feel good actions to the more consistent, effective sort of role.” Diversity Participants described both feeling that the movement wasn’t diverse or inclusive enough, and gratitude for the diversity and inclusivity it has.Encompasshas researched and written insightfully about these issues in the animal rights movement, so I’ll generate only brief advice based on participants’ disclosures: We all seem to feel more comfortable around people who are like us.","text",59

"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","Here’s an exercise: imagine a scenario where you might be looking to recruit activists, and imagine a person you’d expect to connect with in that scenario. What is their age, gender, race, sexual orientation, ability status, education level, and class? Which of these demographics are shared with you or your co-organizers? Which of them are also dominant or majority demographics? This might help you identify some elements of diversity that you’re treating as default, and thus people who might not feel as welcome in your group. If you have activists or organizers who share demographics or other things in common with newcomers, it might be a welcoming move to introduce them. Mourning and Ritual Working fromwisdomdoesn’t mean our grief work is over. Earlier I referred to their grief as largelyintegrated.That means that while emotions are still present, they don’t overwhelm us like they used to. In normal grief, like the death of a loved one, psychologists talk about the bereaved settling into anew relationshipwith the deceased at this stage. Of course, in considering what integrated grief can look like to an animal activist, a model based on normal grief seems absurd. We’re constantly exposed, not just toremindersof our loss, but to new, active, present horrors. On the highway, we silence our conversations as we pass a slaughter truck. Passengers turn their heads in a tiny act of bearing witness. “It’s cows.” someone will say.They’re about to die and there’s nothing we can do about it,no one has to say. I didn’t ask participants if they participate in this ritual, too, but I know that every time I’ve been on the road with other animal activists, it happened. In these moments, we intuitively join in an act of grief that we’re too often alone with. In Pax Fauna, we participate in a biweekly reading of amoment of reflectionfor this purpose. Surely there are more opportunities for animal organizers to incorporate ritual to intentionally support activists’ grief.","text",61

And it just keeps happening. It happens over and over and over. And it's so disappointing. And it's really hard. Because you don't know what happened. You don't have the conversation with them. They just kind of disappear. And they don't want to have the conversation.” Conflict Resolution While this study didn’t examine conflict dynamics directly, several themes arose regarding conflict within organizations. I’ll present findings in two categories to differentiate between private and public conflicts. Private conflict Private conflict refers to conflicts that aren’t published, though they’re generally known to more individuals than just those directly involved. Private conflicts often led to participants or their co-organizers leaving the work, or even to the dissolution of an entire chapter. The privacyof these conflicts led to participants feeling unsupported. When they left, they perceived a lack of fairness and accountability that the other party in the conflict got to stay. When others left, they felt abandoned and powerless to continue organizing. At no point in this study was there mention of a formal conflict resolution process such as mediation. This may be for several reasons. One is that I didn’t ask about it. Conflict, being a personal and often shameful part of life, may have been uncomfortable for participants to describe in enough detail to include the resolution process.","text",63
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","Another possible reason is that conflict resolution systems didn’t exist, weren’t known to, or weren’t trusted by people experiencing conflicts.","text",64
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","Public conflict Public conflict refers to conflicts that had aspects published online in public or semi-private forums and/or take place in person in front of an audience. In them, the veil of privacy is lifted and witnesses speak more openly about what they know of the conflict dynamics. Those at the center of public conflicts describe painfully alienating experiences that send them into a grief process anew. “It was really heartbreaking because she was our friend and she was so effective at turning people against everything we were doing. Yeah, it was heartbreaking.” Animal Rights Organizer “Shit happens, people are mean, but I'm a kind person. And I want to be a good example of what a long term activist and pillar in a community can look like.” Public conflicts led participants to describe a vague sense that their group or the movement in general has “a lot of drama”. Activists described dynamics where they were expected not to participate in certain groups if they were to participate in or even socialize with others.  Finally, some participants described feeling scared of participating due to conflict. This fear was often a vague sense that one could easily misstep if they aren’t careful, as described in the quote below, but also included a worry that a participant would befound outand experiences of verbal attacks in public spaces. “When it's gotten really bad has been times where I’m scared to even go out or talk or do things like that. And it's hard not to stay up to date on it, and you tend to spend time on it… That's definitely demotivating.” I talked to people on all sides of “cancellations”- public callouts of individuals believed to have caused harm. That is, I spoke to people who participated in callouts to varying degrees, those who were called out themselves, and those affected by a movement where callouts happen. Some fit in all three categories.","text",65
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","Of course, callouts, when they happen, are last resorts in situations where accountability seems inaccessible via less harmful pathways. While study of Nonviolence challenges us to develop our emotional resources to be able to come up with creative solutions beyond violence or passivity, organizations, too, must develop their capacity to deal with conflict so they have more options between having the complaining party leave and participating in a call out. Thelast resortwill come quickly if you haven’t prepared many other options.","text",66
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","“But there have been times where I feel like there's a mob mentality against a group or against a person that doesn't end up helping anyone. And there hasn't been a leadership to be able to stop that mob mentality. And that's a demotivating thing, where the focus is turned off the animal rights activism.” Systems in place “When you have thousands of people that you're dealing with, of course.there's going to be drama… it's just gonna happen. But you have to have systems in place to be able to deal with this kind of stuff, and you have to be transparent. I think that's the biggest key right there- transparency. If you're not transparent with your organizers, your team members, your public, then it's not going to work.” I recommend that organizers plan ahead by creating a conflict resolution system. If possible, create this while your organization is not facing an active conflict. A conflict resolution system should answer the following questions: “When conflict within organizations rises to a level where there's no way that not everybody is affected, it becomes like, out of the realm of individual conflict and turns into a movement conflict. It’s like, what am I doing? I could just run away and do something else or do my own thing. So those parts are like low points that are just really hard to work through. But I feel better for working through them or sticking to it, or trying to find new solutions to them.” Relational Space Preparing for conflict is about more than just a plan for what to do when conflict arises, it’s also about building strong relationships that can hold conflict. “We have weekly meetings of just my core team. And it's not about work. It's about, like, how are you doing? How is everything going? How's your mental health? Like, what's new in your life? You know, how can we all support each other?” Pax Fauna’s founding principles emphasize the importance of organizationalcultureand relationships between people who work together.","text",67
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","Spending time on a regular basis to engage positively in relationships between organizers can be a stitch in time that softens future conflicts.","text",68
"https://paxfauna.org/reports/stages-of-activist-development-a-study-of-us-animal-rights-organizers/","This is the work If you take one thing away from this study, let it be this: as of now, animal rights organizers are in frighteningly small numbers and each one of us is irreplaceable. While conflicts between us are normal and necessary, it is absolutely worth our time to resolve those conflicts. And, it is even more worth our time to prepare systems and agreements for when conflicts happen. Of course, conflict is exhausting work. Don’t mistake your momentary exhaustion with the belief that conflict isn’t worth the energy. I don’t mean to say that we mustn’t rest until we’re all friends again- certainly there are moments when some separationisresolution. But in general, I wish that, during conflicts, we remembered how costly it is to alienate ourselves from another piece of a small community.

"https://paxfauna.org/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge","An icon of fork bracelet inscribed with “The Liberation Pledge” The Failure of the Pledge and a Better Way Towards Vegan Tables In 2015, animal advocates with Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) launched an inspired new campaign among their members. It took courage, required sacrifice, and greatly backfired. This three-part series examines what the movement learned from the Liberation Pledge, how we might energize the intention behind the Pledge in a better way, and a piece to share with friends and family to do just that. What We Learned From the Liberation Pledge How It Started The Liberation Pledge was a fascinating idea and a bit of a disaster. Instead of energizing supporters’ social networks to create change, as its creators intended, it often had the opposite effect- to isolate advocates from their closest relationships. In this piece, you’ll learn The next piece in this series suggests a better way to energize the intention behind the pledge, for animal advocates to align their actions with their values in their personal relationships. The Liberation Pledge was a three-part public pledge to Enthusiasts of the pledge hoped it would create acultural stigmaaround eating animals similar to the stigma that has developed around smoking over recent decades. That is, even while smoking is still practiced, it is prohibited by default in public and private spaces. Before we had the Pledge, many of us felt alienated from friends and family who continued to eat animals. We were forced to choose between two options: speaking up and risking being seen as obnoxious, angry, and argumentative, or keeping the peace with painful inauthenticity, swallowing our intense discomfort at watching our loved ones eat the bodies of animals. The pledge gave us hope that there was another way: being honest with those around us while continuing to spend time with them.","text",4

While some beautiful and inspiring stories were detailed on a Facebook group for the Pledge, it seemed to me that there were many more instances of total disaster: people experiencing huge ruptures in their oldest relationships around the Pledge while often lamenting that those they had just discarded  “care more about eating dead animals than they care about me.” From where I stood, the biggest effect of the Pledge was for advocates to lose relationships with family members who didn’t comply. Upon taking the Pledge, a close friend at the time experienced a years-long estrangement from their family,including those who were already veganwhile many others decided to skip birthdays, weddings, and holidays with family. It’s possible that all of this added stigma around eating animals. With these relationships broken down, we don’t know. My Liberation Pledge I believe the pledge was so popular because it politicized something that we desperately wanted for our own comfort–no animals on the table while we were there–and I took it pretty much as soon as it launched. The Pledge certainly contributed to my alienation from nonvegans, though I neither experienced the best nor the worst of it. My immediate family accommodated a request for vegetarian tables at holiday dinners, but I’m sure that there were many invitations I would have received if not for it. While my overall immersion in the animal rights community during that time certainly deserves some of the credit for the fact that I didn’t develop many new relationships with nonvegans during the following several years, the effect of the Pledge can’t be discounted.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge","A website was created with advice for taking the pledge, which is still online as of this writing. It suggested that pledge-takers write a public statement (a model announcement is provided) to inform their friends and family about their new commitment. It also offered some logistical suggestions for getting together with friends and family who aren’t willing to cooperate with the rules of the Pledge. Most importantly, it laid out the reasoning for why we must, together, participate in the Liberation Pledge (to stigmatize eating animals) and directs the reader to “stay firm and nonviolent in the face of conflict.”","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge","This was the right kind of advice, but it fell far short. With the benefit of hindsight, we can say that the founders of the Liberation Pledge underestimated just how difficult an undertaking they were proposing.In fact, the pledge in practice often had the opposite of its intended effect, an outcome that profoundly undermined DxE’s central theory of change.DxE believed in the power of social networks to create change. That is, by taking bold actions and making personal sacrifices, activists would present a model to their communities and inspire friends and family members to reconsider their views on animals. However, while the pledge was meant to spark this process, in practice, it resulted more often than not in the disconnection of activists from their social networks. Instead of creating change by leveraging their personal relationships (the most important resource activists have, according to the social movement theory of change), the pledge weakened and sometimes even severed these relationships. I believe these problems were mostly a matter of inadequate training. Pledge-takers were sent to the front lines of a fiery struggle for social change (their family dinner table) with nothing but a template letter. In contrast, tactics that involved legal risk or personal safety were only encouraged with plenty of training. While the Pledge wasn’t a matter of life and death, freedom or prison, it was a risk to members’ closest and most important relationships. With 20/20 hindsight, it seems that it was unwise to encourage pledge-takers to risk these relationships with so little training. The Meaning of Nonviolence A lot of people might think of activism as characterized by righteous anger, held in an image of somebody yelling into a megaphone at a protest. But DxE understood that while anger has its place as an energizing and powerful force, the task of winning over hearts and minds is difficult, delicate, and requires extraordinary discipline over our own emotions.","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge","They might not have fully understood how much more difficult this is with our loved ones than with the public at large. The same advocate who can always treat hecklers at a protest with kindness might still be underprepared to treat their own family members with love and acceptance when the topic of animals comes up.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge","The Alienating Aspects of the Framing Instrumentalizing Relationships Framing the Pledge as a political action instrumentalized our closest relationships, communicating to those closest to us that we thought of them as objects to be used for the cause. I Matter to You, but You Don’t Matter to Me By framing the Pledge as a pledge or oath, it was presented as a promise to people who weren’t present. Exasperated by the custom and direction to make a public statement before having private conversations with those affected, the Pledge had an unnecessary effect of communicating to our loved ones that they didn’t really matter to us, at least not in comparison to this new thing we were doing. By not including our loved ones in a decision that would greatly affect our future interactions, we communicated something that was often taken as profound disrespect. At the same time as it communicated that we didn’t particularly care about our loved ones, it explicitly appealed to their care for us, creating a heartbreaking competition about who loves the other less, and therefore gets the accommodation. Some of our loved ones must have felt that they’d be showing disproportionate care for us by agreeing to vegan tables, and so they attempted to call our bluff by serving meat. Of course, not every Pledge conversation went this way, and many included affirmations of how much the relationships meant to us. Some relationships truly were deepened by the pledge, but it seems that they were the exception. Unnecessary Escalation Even if you plan to hold a boundary around sitting at such a table, framing it as such in initial conversations is confrontational to an antisocial degree. Rather than inviting others to understand our experiences, the explicit focus on integrity (I wouldn’t sit if a dog were being eaten) unnecessarily created an adversarial dynamic.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge","One Size Fits None By being all or nothing, the Pledge puts us in a position where we are de facto excluded from many large events or gatherings with people who don’t know us well. In these cases, it won’t  make sense to accommodate us by inconveniencing so many others, especially if our hosts don’t know us well.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/rethinking-the-liberation-pledge","As It Lives Now In the early days of the Pledge, attendees at every DxE event were repeatedly encouraged to take it, in observance of its third tenant, toencourage others to do the same.Today, it is rarely discussed in public, probably due precisely to some of the harms I’ve described. While some people continue to practice it in some form, it seems that the political framing has largely dropped off. We understand that, while it didn’t take off as a political strategy, the practice of only sitting at vegan or vegetarian tables is important for our own mental health. Most people still practicing the Pledge (at least the ones I know) are dedicated animal activists who largely associate with other vegans. When we don’t, we might quietly suggest a vegan establishment and only inform our potential dining companions of the pledge when necessary. “The Pledge” still exists as shorthand for this habit, even when its third tenant and political framing are absent. While mostly inert, I believe that the Pledge continues to cause harm, albeit small harms compared to when it first came about. The Liberation Pledge Facebook Group remains somewhat active as a periodically updated illustration of the Pledge’s continuing effects. A recent post asks for advice for dealing with a mandatory school event, predicting that the writer will end up sitting alone in the corner throughout. To this person, it seems that the Pledge will prevent her from getting to know her classmates and thus prevent her from becoming a person whom they can know well enough to look to as an example. In addition, the poster’s relationship with the Pledge deprivesherof the chance to develop connections with others. A Better Way You may be thinking at this point that I’m encouraging everyone who has taken the Pledge to renounce it: that’s not where I’m going. In the next piece, I offer a proposal for rethinking the concept behind the Pledge to support the relationships and well-being of movement participants.","text",12

"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","Fork bracelets inscribed withLiberation, photo courtesyEnvisionPositive This blog is part of a three-part series. To learn more about the Pledge, start withPart 1. In 2015, I told my family that I couldn’t come to Christmas dinner if they were eating an animal. This was my first act in taking the Liberation Pledge, a public oath to live vegan, refuse to sit at tables where animals are being eaten, and encourage others to do the same. Along with many others, mostly in affiliation with the grassroots animal liberation network Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), I took the Pledge as an honest expression of my own integrity and believed it to be a potent strategy for social change. In hindsight, the Pledge did not have the strategic value we imagined it would, but I’m hopeful that its essence can be expressed constructively- to allow animal advocates to energize their social networks to create change. In this post, I’ll make a proposal to do just that. In contrast with a pledge that we promise to follow in every situation, with every person, the new Liberation Pledge is a promise to have brave conversations with people we’re close to, where a solution is found in collaboration with the other. To this day, I don’t want to sit at tables while animals are being eaten. If I do, I face a difficult choice. I have the option to emotionally disengage from what’s happening, not to think of who is being eaten and what their presence means. If I choose this, then to some extent I disengage emotionally from the people around me. In this case, I’m not bringing my whole self to the table. In some situations, this option surely makes the most sense. Practitioners of the Pledge generally understood this. We might have “broken” the Pledge or simply not practiced it in certain situations. For example, while I took the Pledge around family and friends, I never made such demands at work. Instead, I chose to prioritize the work itself and engage on more of a surface level with my colleagues.","text",4
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","But in other situations, I don’t want to attend and disengage. Then, to fully include myself, I need to ask others to accommodate my emotional needs by refraining from eating animals.","text",5
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","That's where the request comes in, our update to the second tenet of the Liberation Pledge. This is our proposed strategy to achieve the original goal of the Pledge, which was to change the norms around eating animals using the strength of our closest social relationships, while at the same time deepening those relationships. Nonviolence ain’t easy Of courseyou’re angry about what’s happening to animals. I’m angry too. It breaks my heart to know that people who know and love me continue to eat animals’ bodies. Of course we sometimes want to yell or blame or threaten that we aren’t coming to Christmas if they can’t have one goddamn vegan meal in their lives. But nonviolence asks us toaccept sacrifice, for the sake of the cause, to achieve a goal.Sometimes that sacrifice looks like a glamorous photo of civil disobedience, but more often, it’s about building the discipline we need to win people over. It means dealing with our own emotions first, so that when we show up to try to do the work the world needs, we’re intentional, emotionally generous, and unflinchingly nonviolent. What if the most important struggle for animal activists takes place not outside factory farms or in politicians’ offices, but at theirfamily’s dinner table? How would we approach our strongest relationships if we truly believed they were the most valuable resource we have to create social change? Our answer is the request. Steps of the Request Understand that conflict is a vehicle for connection. The request can have a political effect, but that’s not why you’re doing it. It’s about your personal comfort in connection with others, and that’s okay. When you make the request, you’re inviting someone into your world and asking to be understood. When you engage with directness and empathy about the ways that you aren’t currently meeting each other’s needs, you open a door to greater honesty and closeness.","text",6
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","Let’s consider a more radical abandonment of the political framing:Your family doesn’t have to accept any part of your worldview for this to workso long as they can empathize with your experience.Here’s an extreme example. In the TV showBetter Call Saul,an attorney named Chuck believed that he had a condition called Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity (EMS), causing him to live without electricity and often wrapped in a foil blanket. While his condition is portrayed as psychosomatic, his law firm turned off everything electric so that Chuck could come to a meeting for an important case. That decision had nothing to do with the existence of EMS as a condition outside of Chuck’s mind and everything to do with their respect for the founding partner of their firm. They only needed to accepthis experienceof the world, not any objective truth about it, to, quite literally, meet him at the table.","text",7
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","Similarly, for this request, your family only needs to accept that inyour reality,animals are sentient and what’s happening to them is terrifying and heartbreaking. They don’t have to accept that this is objectively true. By explicitly putting aside who’s right, you can allow the request to live in your connection without it requiring the examination of psychological defense mechanisms around eating animals. You can talk to the person themselves, the one who cares about you and doesn’t want to cause you unnecessary suffering, without talking to the part of them that needs to defend itself. While the early framing of the Liberation Pledge talked about using your social capital to create a cultural stigma around eating animals, it missed the mechanism by which this can happen- empathic connection, where our loved ones feel generously enough towards us to consider our world and feel pain onourbehalf. By accepting that their realities may differ from ours and not, in this conversation, asking that they feel empathic pain on behalf of animals themselves, we have a chance at making the request from a place of real connection. This is a great strategy to help them eventually empathize with animals, but it will work better if you focus on the connection,notthe strategy. Consider what level of conflict the relationship can hold at this point. Back to the example of EMS in Better Call Saul, it’s important to the example that Chuck was a respected partner of the firm. With such a high need for accommodations for the most basic of participation, he was generally only shown interacting with those who respected him greatly. Consider, who are you to the people you’re making this request of? If they asked you to accommodate them in a way that might be emotionally difficult for you, would you be likely to challenge yourself to serve the relationship?","text",8
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","If not, it might make more sense to take care of yourself in a way that doesn’t rely on strength the relationship doesn’t have right now, and save the difficult conversation of the request for people you’re more invested in.","text",9
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","Empathy A paradoxical mantra of Nonviolent Communication is thatit’s hard to listen if you haven’t been heard.The paradox lies in the fact that it’s true for both parties, but only one person gets to be heard first, often leading to an emotional standoff where people in conflict talk past each other. If we, as practitioners of nonviolence, can offer to do the hearing first and frequently, we can break that vicious cycle and be more likely to have a connective conversation. In the first part of the conversation, be prepared to communicate the following messages, in words that are as natural to you and your relationship as possible. Request The practical difference between the original Liberation Pledge and our update is that the original Pledge was delivered in a static state, “I don’t sit at tables where animals are being eaten” where the outcome of the updated Pledge is determined through conversationin collaborationwith the other. “I’m thinking about Thanksgiving and feeling pretty worried about how I’ll feel with a turkey there. What’s coming up for you hearing that much? I think I understand, am I getting it? Are you open to hearing more about what’s coming up for me? How is that to hear? How would it be for you to… go without the turkey? Let me prepare a main dish instead? Have me visit after dinner? What ideas do you have for how we can work this out?” Another difference in this proposal is to rethink our request asspecific to a relationship, not a table or event. This can set us up for more realistic positive outcomes and help us invest our energy in productive ways. You might choose to attend a large family reunion where animals are being eaten and only make the request to those you most know and trust, letting their show of solidarity be a signal to others. Repeat The more we can accept that this conversation is pretty difficult for the people we’re talking to, and stay in it with patience, the more likely we’ll have a connecting outcome.","text",10
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","While the framing presented here is meant to reduce defensiveness, your loved ones will likely be carrying some messages from their own discomfort with eating animals, from what they’ve heard from others, and maybe even from what they’ve heard from you in the past.","text",11
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","Expect to continuously return to empathy- letting them know what you’re hearing is important to them, and checking to see if you got it right- as long as it takes. What about relationships that we’re willing to end over this? Conflict is extremely hard, and working through it in relationships usually takes much more time and energy than we expect. Practicing nonviolence doesn’t mean investing fully in every relationship or every conflict. Sometimes, you might not be willing to sit at a table or attend an event without the request being met fully and immediately, and you may not have the kind of relationship where you want to be so vulnerable as to share the pain of living in a world with the awareness of animals that you have. In these cases, you might not decide to have a conversation about it. You might suggest a vegan restaurant or a walk in the park instead of lunch, or you might just decline an invitation. If you do decide to have a conversation, I recommend the same steps as above, with only as much investment in empathy as you’re willing to give, and with a blameless acceptance of the possibility that you might not be compatible dining companions. What the Original Pledge Got Right There are certainly elements of the Pledge that we’re preserving. Firstly, the Pledge asked us to be willing to make ourselves uncomfortable to act in accordance with our values. The bravery that Pledgers developed, and their willingness to withstand social pressure for a cause, is an undeniable positive outcome, and a central tenant of the updated Liberation Pledge. Interactions that are awkward or clunky are not a sign of failure- they’re a necessary part of developing a new skill. While this model doesn’t demand a public commitment to have a conversation at every opportunity, it does contain the request that we push ourselves to show up authentically in these conversations, even when it’s hard.","text",12
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","In fact, a display of nervousness or anxiety around the conversation can be another way to show how much your loved ones matter to you.","text",13

I took the Pledge to set firm and reasonable boundaries with people. Carnism gives people blinders and they have trouble understanding that there even is a boundary. The Pledge gave me something concrete I could point to and send people off to cope with on their own time at their own pace, instead of me having to try and coach them through it every time this common social issue comes up.

"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","Hi Mike, I hear how useful the Pledge is to you for setting boundaries for yourself, how much work it is to coach them through it every time, and how important the simplicity of a boundary can be. I'm also getting how important the integrity of the Pledge is- that it doesn't become something so flexible that it's meaningless. Am I getting it? I want to clarify that I did take the Pledge. To this day, my family celebrates holidays with fully vegan meals despite me being the only vegan, and that's very important to me. I've seen a lot of good and bad outcomes of the Pledge, and I want to suggest a way we can talk about the Pledge that emphasizes its transformative potential. To me, while it's useful to know that I can refuse to sit anywhere I don't want to sit, the most important positive outcomes of the Pledge were the honest conversations it caused. I also want to clarify that this isn't DxE. The Liberation Pledge was started by people who were involved in DxE at the time, but it hasn't been a DxE project for years. Recently, its creators turned the website over to Pax Fauna. Far from winding down the Pledge, we're working on relaunching it in a way that makes the most of its potential to energize the movement through personal relationships.","text",23

I'm learning from all that there definitely are people who still practice the pledge and feel strongly about it (as opposed to people who still try to avoid tables but never encourage others to take the pledge, for example) and that leads me to think it probably does make more sense to hold the three part format mostly intact while making changes to the framing in other parts of the website.I'd like to understand your perspective more, and I'm willing to keep going back and forth on the comments if you prefer, but I'm thinking it might be most productive to have a call if you're willing.

"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","Yes, I agree that's the best outcome. My criticism is mostly a matter of framing- I think the conversations aresomuch more important that they should be the emphasis, and that when we do have the conversations, listening and emphasizing where we *are* flexible (I'll cook, we'll go for a walk instead, we'll have a vegan thanksgiving on Wednesday and I'll go somewhere else on Thursday, what sounds good to you?) as opposed to where we are not (I won't sit at the table while you're eating animals) will lead to more connection. The area where my model diverts from the original Pledge is that I think we should recognize the power of someone getting solidarity-veganism from individuals in order to attend a large event where animals are being served. In these cases, I think the table is quite arbitrary. For example, does it really count as taking the Pledge if people are snacking on hors d'vours and not sitting around a table? Am I ""breaking"" the Pledge if I stand far away from the table where animals' bodies are offered? What if I chat with someone who was still chewing something when they approached me, and I don't know on what (or who)? What if I arrive to the event after the food is gone, but no one knows why? The original Pledge doesn't require we make any requests in such a situation, and it can be so tempting not to. Or, once I went to a wedding where my partner and I had our own table, and virtually no one knew why. (Certainly no one learned about the Pledge from this outcome) We were more comfortable because animals being eaten weren't visible to us, but I don't think it did much work to stigmatize the practice. Of course, we're allowed to make decisions for our own comfort, but that's not what the Pledge is for. If we had, instead, sat at a large table surrounded by a small handful of people who ate vegan at our request, that solidarity would have been much louder than our isolation was, especially to those who don't really know us.","text",35

"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","Hi Mark. It makes sense to have objections given the way you're seeing it- that another group is deciding to water down the Pledge. I don't want that either. The mismatch I'm seeing is that I actually think these changes strengthen the Pledge. In day-to-day life, there's no reason we'd accept different outcomes- the difference I'm proposing is completely a matter of framing. And I'll paste from my most recent comment to explain the thinking that the new pledge is stronger than the old one. The area where my model diverts from the original Pledge is that I think we should recognize the power of someone getting solidarity-veganism from individuals in order to attend a large event where animals are being served.

"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","Hi Eva. My objections to the change remain. While I do agree that more of an emphasis can be on the framing, a version of this can be added without taking anything else away (as I certainly do not agree with some of the framing you have detailed). You say to ""focus on the connection, not the strategy"". Why can’t we do both? We can indeed ""focus on the connection, AND the strategy"". You make so many assumptions that do not apply to everyone. You state it has “greatly backfired” and is “a bit of a disaster” before proclaiming to outline “what the movement learned” from this. Who is the movement? You? Did you consult “the movement” to gain consensus on these learnings? I know many who are advocates of the Pledge in its current form, who are angry and upset with your proposal. There are many statements and comments you make that disturb me but I don’t see any benefit in going through them in detail. Like I said originally, if, as an organisation, you don't want to honour the principles of the pledge in its original form then why not hand it over to someone that will? Your blog spends so much time advocating for mutual respect and not imposing your view/beliefs on someone else and then you propose doing this! It’s such a contradiction.","text",55

"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","Hi Mark, I replied to the objection about process on Facebook, where more people can join in the discussion, and I'll respond to the why-not-both and hypocrisy comments here. Strategy might have been a poor word choice, given its distinct meaning in social activism. In Nonviolent Communication, strategy refers to the thing we're asking for, which is how I meant it- the vegan table, the skipped Christmas dinner, the walk instead of lunch. Any of those would be acceptable to a Pledge taker, right? So in saying I want to focus on the connection rather than the strategy, I mean that I want to emphasize that we approach conversations in a compassionate way that cares for the connection while emphasizing some flexibility on the strategy (which Pledge takers already have, right? we're willing to skip dinner or go- if it's vegan). The alternative to this- focusing on the strategy- would be a conversation that emphasizes a demand for the vegan table so that we can act in our own integrity. I think I'm hearing that you find this objectionable also, but aren't interested in elaborating- am I getting that right? If you change your mind, I'd like to hear whether or why the dialogue-forward approach feels out of integrity with the Pledge (or is it soley the de-emphasis on vegan tables you're objecting to?) I'm also curious about your view of the edge cases I described before, and how they fit in to your understanding of the Pledge. I'm asking these questions because I suspect we're not in as much disagreement as you might think and I'm trying to figure out where our points of agreement and disagreement are. On the final point, I want to clarify that I'm not saying we shouldn't impose our views on other people. Killing animals is violent and wrong and we should do whatever we can to stop it. I'm arguing that the Pledge, as often practiced and as framed in the legacy Pledge site, isn't working like we hoped it would.","text",58

Everyone who chose to take the Liberation pledge did so voluntarily because they agreed with its principles as originally stated. If they didn't agree, found it to be ineffective or thought they had something better they weren't in any way required to continue with it. If you feel you can create something better please introduce a different pledge so people can choose it if and only if they think it is an improvement.

"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","I want to acknowledge that several people have expressed unhappiness with the proposed changes. I hear a strong commitment to the original model, and deep frustration that changes have been proposed without consultation. Change can be so hard, especially when it is unexpected or if it doesn't feel like one's experiences are being honored in the process. From my perspective, I see a lot of value in the new framing. I did the Pledge for several years. In the process, some relationships were irreparably broken. I think that's not because I have a need to honor animals, but because of the way I approached the conversation. I was so triggered about the harms my loved ones were participating in, that I couldn't see or hear their perspectives. I didn't value the relationships as much as I valued the needs of other animals. And this was felt. Most of my friends, family, or coworkers were not able to see the animals' needs or experiences--until I got more vulnerable with them. Even then, some were unwilling to go there. They couldn't get passed what they perceived as self-righteousness, judgment, and selfishness from me. I believe this has left some feeling more entrenched in their positions. I believe this is a net loss for everyone and a missed opportunity. I am curious to hear how the original form of the Pledge is working for your and others in your lives. Have you observed any transformative (internal) change in your friends or family? If so, could you imagine this kind of shift with the proposed reframe?","text",68

"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","I have read both blog posts (was there supposed to be three?) and written down my thoughts as I’ve gone along. Fundamentally I completely agree with the theory of non-violence as a social movement strategy that seems to underpin this revision of the pledge. On the whole I think I actually generally agree with what you’re trying to do here which is essentially, if I’ve got this right, to show your loved ones it is personal, in a non-violent manner. This is really the conclusion I’ve come to myself as to how I approach it, even though, as you’ll see, for me the political and the personal are hard to separate. I do have a few disagreements though which I’ve put below. I really respect that your reconsidering of the pledge comes from a place of concern for activists’ mental health and of course of a desire to be more effective in our activism for the benefit of our fellow non-human animals. There should always be room to think of how our activism can be improved. So here goes…I would agree with the ‘flaws’ pointed out around the pledge’s inception, if these were true, but for me the pledge was never about utilising social networks and relationships in the way described. I understood if that idea was that if all vegans took the pledge, this would unify us as a group who’d taken a stand, in order to put pressure on the non-vegans. This was the social movement element. It was not designed to create a forced entry point in to veganism at the individual level. That is not to say that family and social groups were not disrupted at an individual level, and yes, it was a hard thing to take on. But something I’m sure most pledge takers would figure out for themselves.","text",71
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","I myself took on pledge for what I saw as its conceptual and tactical value, more so than for the fact that I felt uncomfortable being around dead bodies - at some level I was uncomfortable but it was tolerable (such is the depth of my desensitisation at this level, even after 14 years I do not consistently find the presence of flesh unbearable and I’m aware this may shock some people) and so I grappled a long time with how to frame it, and indeed how to enact it. The idea of  the pledge did fuel anger in me","text",72
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","Just as we didn’t necessarily expect people to go vegan because of our pledge, we never expected large scale events or settings to cater for us; we were willing to avoid them. That said, I remain hopeful that in less personal settings such as the workplace, for example, after the recent acceptance in Uk law of veganism as a belief system which can’t be discriminated against, UK dwellers we may start to feel confident in making demands for no meat at work events, for example. We also don’t need a fork round our wrist to do this either, although doing so could help galvanise the move. For me, the pledge is and has remained political for these reasons. Of course, to maintain any moral congruity, I can’t demand that people don’t eat flesh around me at work when I don’t make the same demands at home, or vice-versa and so the political and the social are inevitably entangled. In terms of not including our loved ones in the decision- I ask that, whether it’s discussed first or not, how can someone really feel included in a decision I’ve made, that they don’t like. It will always be seen as a selfish rejection. On the other hand my closest friends who support my pledge were not included on the decision either, and they are not offended by my choices. It certainly made me feel closer to these people but I question where the evidence is that such cases are in the minority. If it comes from an analysis of the comments on the Facebook support group then I would argue that people such as myself only come on there to moan about the difficulties, not the successes. Certainly I can relate to the feeling of sadness that come with the questions about ‘who loves the other less’ but as I said above, I don’t think this can be avoided. Pledge takers and their supporters understand that vegans will have previously put their own needs before others by sitting round a table in order to ‘keep the peace’.","text",73
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","I wholeheartedly agree with the principles of non violence and that it is crucial for socialchange. I don’t agree that we can’t express our upset to someone who refuses to accept our boundaries. This is not healthy and I can’t think of another example where this should be encouraged.","text",74
"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","The whole part in blog 2 about picking who we try and connect with on this matter will cause more confusion and hurt . Whilst I completely understand the point being made here, unfortunately I feel a close family member may struggle to understand why you ask them to accommodate you, when you don’t ask ‘less important’ people, particularly less emotionally important people, to do the same. They may understand you not feeling you can ask at work (although ironically as I’ve said above, I actually feel that from a political and non emotional perspective, this is the perfect place to ask, certainly in the UK) But to give an example, when I explained to my step daughter that I would not make an exception on the pledge for her wedding, her response was that she fully expected that I would have done so for my son, had he asked (she was wrong) so why couldn’t I for her? You can imagine her hurt if I made an exception for an acquaintance I didn’t know well. This kind of inconsistency creates another version of the ‘who loves who more than who’ heartbreak. Even if we explained to people why it was more important to target those closest to us, and they understood it, the moral consistency remains undermined, and doesn’t work for those who in any case find the presence of dead flesh intolerable. Fundamentally it seems to me that this is about getting those that care about you to understand what veganism and the pledge means to you and to not eat flesh in your presence. This means you can still attend events but avoid individuals eating flesh as much as possible. This does seem a workable solution for me personally and seems much easier than not attending at all. Actually this was how I imagined my first post-pledge Xmas with my family - if it was a buffet I could dodge those with their mouth full. Had I been more secure in this approach, without going in to detail it may have been more successful than the disaster it turned out to be.","text",75

"https://paxfauna.org/blog/the-request-an-evolution-of-the-liberation-pledge","Hi. I'm considering taking the Pledge, so, I googled it, and I arrived till this page.Is the Pledge necessarily linked to any organisation that can reframe it anytime, or, Eva, your proposal is just that, a proposal that needs to be considered and accepted by the community of ""pledgers""? Also, I would love to hear from people that took it. From their personal experiences and to know what impact they think the Pledge has on the normalisation of carnism. As I see it right now the Pledge has the potential to be a force towards the de-normalisation of carnism. I imagine it could help lead us to a world where veganism is the moral baseline. I'd like to know if for most of the people that took the Pledge, it is, effectively, this driving force, or maybe even the opposite. I just requested joining the FB support group. I hope I will find some answers there. But if anyone wants to put in their two cents I'd be grateful. Also, is it possible to know how many people took the Pledge si far? Thanks!","text",85

The Pledge isn't an organization, so it doesn't have a formalized way of updating and we don't know how many people took it. It was started by people in Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) but the website hadn't been maintained for a long time when I took it over. Scrolling the Facebook group is a great way to hear directly from more people who took it, and I'm happy to receive more comments here if folks would like to share personal experiences.","text",88
