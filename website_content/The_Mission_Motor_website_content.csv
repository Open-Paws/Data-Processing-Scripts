The work of a director brought with it new and unknown topics. The development of the foundation which was just a few months old, came on top of that. I enjoy a challenge but was very happy with all the help that The Mission Motor offered me. I received support in setting up my foundation, received practical tips and tricks, and immediately applicable tools and templates. This way I could get started quickly and effectively and make a lot of progress.
