"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/welfare-improvements","FISH WELFAREIMPROVEMENTS IN AQUACULTURE By Marco Cerqueira & Thomas Billington ​ Fish welfare is a topic gaining global recognition. While fish are at the center of this, the value of improving fish welfare extends far beyond the fish themselves. Fish welfare benefits the environment, strengthens rural livelihoods, and advances social wellbeing. As such, increasing fish welfare in aquaculture is a critical part of building a less damaging food system. ​ The report discusses three main sections: Welfare issues in farms ​ Fish species and context ​ Welfare assessment Understanding Welfare 1 Different aquaculture systems ​ Different life stages ​ Different stakeholders Making Welfare Improve-ments 2 Carp farming in India ​ Welfare assessment for rohu and catla ​ Potential welfare improvements Welfare Improvements for Carpin India 3 We hope that this report can help equip all stakeholders in fish welfare with the relevant knowledge to best address fish welfare in their context. SUMMARY ​ Section 1 ​Section One of the report identifiesthree conditions necessary for properly improving fish welfare in aquaculture: first, a general understanding of the welfare issues faced by fish in farms; second, knowledge of the specifics surrounding the fish species, farming system, and local context being targeted; and third, a welfare assessment of specifically targeted fish in the farm environment. We believe that all stakeholders in fish welfare should have access to knowledge of these conditions, andthis report aims to provide information and applicable tools concerning each. ​ Section 2 ​Section Two of the report focuses on the next step after obtaining the three conditions outlined above:making welfare improvements. This section outlines actionable welfare improvements available for different aquaculture systems, life stages, and stakeholders.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/welfare-improvements","​ Section 3 ​Section Three applies the information from previous sections to Fish Welfare Initiative’s planned work for carp species in India. Weoutline contextual information on carp farming in India, assess welfare according to our farm visits and farm surveys, and review potential welfare improvements. From this analysis, we draw a preliminary conclusion as to which welfare improvements we should focus on to maximize our impact on fish, concluding that water quality is the most promising direction for our work.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/asia","Aquaculture in Asian Countries By Jennifer-Justine Kirsch and Marco Cerqueira In the past few decades, several Asian countries have risen to become the largest finfish producers worldwide. In 2018, almost 90% of all commodified fish came from Asian countries, with China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Bangladesh dominating the global market. Today, production is growing fast, and this adds a wide range of welfare problems. Tapping into existing challenges and a dynamic industry, now is an important time to explore high-leverage opportunities for fish welfare work in this region. This report will give an overview of aquaculture in Asian countries and discuss the opportunities and challenges of fish welfare work with a focus on South, East, and Southeast Asia. The issues raised here require urgent action and shared responsibility. They also require the consideration of complex interactions between cultural beliefs, the international fish trade, fish consumption, institutional politics, and farmers' awareness of fish welfare. There is no single Asian country that is most promising for fish welfare work. Rather, they all have opportunity for and constraints to impactful work. But with 73 to 180 billion fish alive on farms right now and even more in the future, effective work in any of these top-producing countries could affect billions of lives.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/salmon-welfare","Welfare Issues in Farmed Atlantic Salmon By Mark Borthwick Salmon is the most valuable fish in the world, with a harvest of 2.2 million tonnes of salmon (approximately 1 billion head of fish producing USD $15.4bn annually). Despite a steady improvement in standards and practices in salmon aquaculture over the past two decades, innovative husbandry techniques have been accompanied by new welfare issues. ​ This paper outlines the main welfare issues in contemporary aquaculture of Atlantic salmon, and identifies areas where further research is required. The main findings are as follows: ​ Salmon fare particularly poorly in captivity,​ and do not have a life which the Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) would consider ""worth living."" Salmon are essentially kept in battery conditions, despite evidence that their quality of life is significantly impacted by current farming practices. Disease​. Pesticide-resistant sea lice present an existential threat to the salmon farming industry, and represent an extinction-level threat to wild salmon populations. Salmon are obligate carnivores, to which other animals are fed. One third of all caught fish are fed to farmed fish, and salmon are increasingly fed a mixture of soy, caught fish, and poultry meal. This essay estimates that each farmed salmon is fed the equivalent of 9 herring, further compounding welfare issues for animals in the supply chain. Slaughter methodsh​ave been uncritically appropriated from terrestrial animals, and not based upon the best available evidence for humane slaughter of teleost fish. Species-specific research​is required to determine whether the control mechanisms for salmon’s preferred behaviors can be emulated in captivity.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/fish-welfare-improvements","FISH WELFAREIMPROVEMENTS IN AQUACULTURE By Marco Cerqueira & Thomas Billington ​ Fish welfare is a topic gaining global recognition. While fish are at the center of this, the value of improving fish welfare extends far beyond the fish themselves. Fish welfare benefits the environment, strengthens rural livelihoods, and advances social well-being. As such, increasing fish welfare in aquaculture is a critical part of building a less damaging food system. ​ The report discusses three main sections: Welfare issues in farms ​ Fish species and context ​ Welfare assessment Understanding Welfare 1 Different aquaculture systems ​ Different life stages ​ Different stakeholders Making Welfare Improve-ments 2 Carp farming in India ​ Welfare assessment for rohu and catla ​ Potential welfare improvements Welfare Improvements for Carpin India 3 We hope that this report can help equip all stakeholders in fish welfare with the relevant knowledge to best address fish welfare in their context. SUMMARY ​ Section 1 ​Section One of the report identifiesthree conditions necessary for properly improving fish welfare in aquaculture: first, a general understanding of the welfare issues faced by fish in farms; second, knowledge of the specifics surrounding the fish species, farming system, and local context being targeted; and third, a welfare assessment of specifically targeted fish in the farm environment. We believe that all stakeholders in fish welfare should have access to knowledge of these conditions, andthis report aims to provide information and applicable tools concerning each. ​ Section 2 ​Section Two of the report focuses on the next step after obtaining the three conditions outlined above:making welfare improvements. This section outlines actionable welfare improvements available for different aquaculture systems, life stages, and stakeholders.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/fish-welfare-improvements","​ Section 3 ​Section Three applies the information from previous sections to Fish Welfare Initiative’s planned work for carp species in India. Weoutline contextual information on carp farming in India, assess welfare according to our farm visits and farm surveys, and review potential welfare improvements. From this analysis, we draw a preliminary conclusion as to which welfare improvements we should focus on to maximize our impact on fish, concluding that water quality is the most promising direction for our work.","text",4

Until then, we want to be fully transparent about which fishes we count as helped and are thus explaining each instance in detail on our publicly availableTotal Impact sheet. The explanations on there are written by our ground staff who requested the respective welfare improvements from farmers. They include information on expected intensity and duration of the welfare improvement. To get the number of fishes helped per dollar, we divide the sum of fishes living in a farm with welfare improvements by the total expenses we have had as a charity so far. Helping Fishes Through Our Farm Program Currently, most of the fishes we help result from working with farmers through theAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture (ARA). Specifically, they live on farms where we believe we have been responsible for stocking density and/or water quality improvements. ​ Helping Fishes Through Stocking Density Improvements When joining the ARA, farmers commit to reducing their stocking densities to 3,000 fishes per acre or less in the following farming cycle. We believe that this limit facilitates higher fish welfare by avoiding crowding and affiliated injuries and discomfort.","text",7
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/impact","We only count fishes as helped if the stocking density reduction is 10% or more and verified through a harvest event.","text",8
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/impact","​​ Helping Fishes Through Water Quality Improvements We identified water quality as one of the major welfare infringements for fishes on Indian farms. Few farmers conduct adequate water quality assessments, frequently leaving their fishes to live in unsuitable conditions. ARA staff visit farmers for regular water quality assessments to detect potential water quality issues. If a parameter falls outside ourrequired ranges, we request the farmer to implement corrective actions to improve water quality and, ultimately, fish welfare. ​ We only count fishes as helped if the corrective actions would not have otherwise been implemented and we are at least 80% confident that the improvement made a positive impact on the fishes' lives. ​ ​The graph below further explains the process of helping fishes through water quality improvements at the ARA:","text",9

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/impact","India: 2,050,000 fishes 1,400,000 shrimps Philippines: 10,000 fishes Portugal: 56,000 fishes Note: In India, we primarily help fishes through theAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture. In Portugal, we worked withone producerto improve welfare. In the Philippines, we helped fishes through ourFarmer Engagement Project. Limitations of our numbers​ 1. We don’t (currently) assess magnitude. The numbers of fishes potentially helped do not consider the degree to which they were helped.​ While our welfare improvements theoretically should improve fish welfare, given the on-the-ground implementation difficulties and our current lack of a rigorous impact analysis, we are still significantly uncertain about the magnitude of our per-fish impact. Thus, it is unfortunately possible that our improvements are currently only having a trivial impact. In part address this uncertainty, we areplanning to developa welfare assessment protocol in 2024. In the long-run, we aspire that FWI (as well as all animal welfare organizations) move towards a system like that of theWelfare Footprint Project. 2. We generalize. It is possible that some fishes counted may not have suffered in the absence of our intervention. For example, water quality is dynamic depending on where fish are in the farm. Thus, we do not know with certainty that all individuals would have suffered under water quality levels we deem inadequate.​ 3. We only count the fishes we know of. It is common for there to be fish within a farm that have not been intentionally stocked by the farmer, such as invasive fishes who enter the system through in-flow or fishes that were not successfully removed in previous harvests. We expect that in almost all cases our improvements will also positively improve these fishes’ lives. However, we do not currently have a way to account for our impact on these individuals, so they are excluded.​ 4. We focus primarily on fishes, not shrimps.","text",15
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/impact","We work with farmers farming fish or shrimp, or both in polyculture. Thus, our welfare improvements affect both fishes and shrimps. We see the fishes' lives we improve as our primary area of impact because our interventions are targeting fish species. We are even less certain of the impact we have on shrimps, even though farmers stock a lot more shrimps in each farm.​","text",16
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/impact","5. We have limited shrimp welfare knowledge. We know much less about shrimp welfare. The focus of our improvements and measurements has been on fishes. As such, we are less confident that shrimps have been significantly positively affected by our interventions than we are for fishes. However, we are relatively confident that the improvements we make that target fish welfare can benefit shrimps, mainly because improving water quality parameters like dissolved oxygen, temperature, and pH is essential for shrimp welfare.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/april-2024","FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ON APRIL 1, 2024:Fish Welfare Initiative Pivots to Digital Fishes, Citing AI Dominance and Non-Trivial Existential Risk Possibilities In a bold move that has both confused and amused stakeholders, Fish Welfare Initiative (FWI) announced its plans to pivot entirely to improving the welfare of digital fishes. The organization, previously known for its hands-on approach to improving fish welfare on the farm, is taking a deep dive into the virtual oceans of simulated fish suffering. ​ The reasoning for this pivot involves FWI’s latest complex cost-effectiveness and BOTEC analysis, involving several whiteboards and at least one borrowed quantum computer. ""After an extensive review of our strategies and a lot of soul-searching, we've roughly estimated there's a 0.0000000001% chance that focusing on digital fishes could be impactful,"" stated the FWI spokesperson. ""Given the estimated 17.5 duodecillion digital fishes across multitudes of simulated environments, we’re estimating an astounding cost-effectiveness of influencing upwards of 83 quadrillion fish lives per dollar, and these are all conservative estimates!” ​ The strategic realignment has also added a new dimension to FWI'sbitter rivalrywith the Shrimp Welfare Project. ""With our cost-effectiveness now dramatically improved, we’re definitely in the lead,"" chuckled one senior staffer FWI, referring to the long-standing camaraderie-turned-competitiveness with their crustacean-focused counterparts. “We’re not just talking small fry anymore. We expect this will net us a win in the next effectiveness rankings. May the best welfare initiative win, and here’s hoping it’s us—for the fishes, of course, both real and rendered.” ​ Staff at FWI have expressed relief over the shift in focus. ""I was beginning to think we weren't pivoting enough,"" confessed one junior analyst, ""but this strategic shift has assuaged my concerns. It's reassuring to see FWI take the plight of digital fishes seriously. . .","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/april-2024","even if they're composed of pixels.""","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/april-2024","Critics argue that FWI's shift seems suspiciously convenient, given the current global spotlight on artificial intelligence. ""Let's be real,"" says one disillusioned supporter, ""It's all about AI now. Last week I saw a fish playing Pong. It's only a matter of time before they start demanding their own Silicon Valley startup."" The change has already resulted in a sea of benefits to the organization. ""Since our pivot to a digital focus, the donations have just been pouring in,"" beamed FWI's Chief Development Officer. ""We've received so much funding over the last few days that we’ve quadrupled all staff salaries, and we're considering purchasing the recently-vacated Wytham Abbey Manor House as our new head office."" ​ The transition, while financially fruitful, has been shrouded in mystery, with the finer details of the plan withheld from the public. FWI staffers emphasize the sensitivity of the subject, hinting at info-hazards with non-trivial possibilities leading to either x-, y-, or z-risks. “It’s a slippery slope,” an FWI spokesperson cautioned. “Releasing our strategies could have a ripple effect, leading to unintended consequences in the virtual biosphere. And don’t even get me started on its implications for multi-dimensional acausal aquatic trades.” ​ As FWI dives headfirst into the pixelated unknown, the digital fish community awaits with bated breath, hoping for a future where virtual fishes can swim without fear of the delete key. ​ Learn more.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/donate","As we have not yet published formal plans or budgets for 2025, we consider the value of a donation now to FWI to be more uncertain than usual. For potential donors interested in more certainty of the exact programs their donation would fund, we encourage them to instead donate toother high-impact organizationsright now. ​ We expect to publish our plans for 2025 in November, and will update our website andnewsletteraccordingly. How does FWI spend its money? In 2024, our planned spending breakdown is roughly the following: 42% on R&D to investigate and test new welfare improvements and programs in India. 18% on implementing and improving our main program in India, theAlliance For Responsible Aquaculture. 7% on policy and stakeholder work in India, primarily for the purpose of gaining broader and government support for our programming. 33% on non-program specific staff and administrative costs, such as leadership, operations, and communications personnel, and fees to our service contractorin India. For more information, see our2024 Budgetand2024 OKRs. You can see previous budgets and OKRs linked on ourTransparency page. What has been your impact so far? We currently estimate that we have improved the lives of over 1 million farmed fishes, although the magnitude at which we improved their lives is still somewhat unclear. See ourGlobal Impact pagefor more information. We also believe that we’ve built important foundations and set important precedents for future fish welfare work—seemorebelow. How exactly do you help fishes? In our main country of operation, India, and in our main program there, theAlliance For Responsible Aquaculture, the welfare improvements we are currently implementing are stocking density caps and water quality corrective actions.","text",5
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/donate","In practice, this means fishes are helped by one of the following mechanisms at our partner farms: The farmer reduces stocking densities from what they would counterfactually have been, making a farm less crowded for the fishes (less common).","text",6
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/donate","We detect poor water quality at the farm in one of our regular monitoring visits, we provide the farmer a corrective action to implement, and then our follow-up measurements indicate that conditions have significantly (and counterfactually) improved (more common). Note that we consider all fishes helped on a case-by-case basis. Fishes are not automatically helped—or considered as such—just when a farm enrolls in our programming. For more information on this, seeour Global Impact page. We are also investing heavily now in R&D to determine improved interventions for helping these animals. Why would farmers voluntarily make these changes? There are a couple factors that lead farmers to want to make changes beneficial to fish welfare: Free water-quality monitoring: We provide free-of-cost water-quality monitoring to farmers participating in ourAlliance For Responsible Aquaculture. Economic benefit: Thepracticeswe are currently recommending (improved water quality and capped stocking densities) havesome benefitsfor farmers: farmers understand better than anyone that improved water quality leads to fewer diseases and lower mortality rates. We believe that stocking density reductions lead to a more stable operation for farmers— fewer fishes, feed, and antimicrobials are needed (lowering expenses), less labor is needed, and farms are less likely to experience catastrophic disease outbreaks and mortalities, thus mitigating two issues that currently plague Indian aquaculture. Supportive field staff: Our ground team live and work in the same or nearby communities as the farmers, and build trust with them. Some of our staff are from the same communities as the farmers. Our team is sometimes the only support these farmers receive. Pride in doing the right thing: Our experience has shown us that Indian farmers take pride in their professions and ways of life, and are held in high regard in Indian culture.","text",7
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/donate","Many thus take pride in doing the right thing for animals and for society, and are interested in adopting best practices.","text",8
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/donate","Is FWI primarily a research or an implementation charity? As you can see from our budget breakdownabove, we are currently investing the majority of our programmatic resources into research. This is because we have come to believe that we can identify more impactful and cost-effective programs than we are currently undertaking. The core of FWI though, as we announced in thefirst public talkwe ever gave, has always remained the same: our focus is to implement impactful programs for farmed fishes. This is partly because of what we believe our long-term comparative advantage to be, and also partly because we are generally somewhat skeptical of theories of change that involve publishing research in the hope that some implementing organizations will later use it to improve their programming. What has changed here is that we now feel the need to do much more research than we initially thought. We have thus updated our capacity accordingly, for instance by working with experts in fish welfare (seeMarco) and evidence-based program design (seePaul). Overall, we believe FWI is best viewed as an implementation charity that happens to be in a primarily research stage right now. We hope and expect to transition to focusing the majority of our resources to the implementation of our findings over the coming 2–3 years (though it is worth noting that we’ve broadly believed the same thing for the past 4 years now). Does FWI operate outside of India? While India is our main focus of operations, we also have completed projects in thePhilippinesandChina,and smaller ones inPortugaland theUK. We mostly focus our efforts on just operating bigger projects in a few contexts as opposed to smaller projects across many contexts. However, we do opportunistically consider particularly impactful opportunities. Where is FWI’s headquarters located?","text",9
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/donate","That depends on what you mean by headquarters: Our first entity, and the entity that receives most of our funding, is registered in the US, but we have no office there and only one US staff member.","text",10
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/donate","Most of our staff are Indian, and much of our work takes place in India.

FWI is currently helping fishes around the order of magnitude of 1 fish helped per dollar. You can learn more about this calculation on ourGlobal Impact page. There’s a few reasons not to read too much into this though: We are currently investing heavily in R&D to significantly improve our programming and thus cost effectiveness, so we expect this estimate to change significantly over the coming years. This estimate doesn’t include the degree to which each individual fish is helped (though noting that this is a problem almost universally across animal advocacy). We believe organizations can provide other value that is not captured in cost-effectiveness estimates. For instance, we believe that one of the most important outcomes that FWI has achieved is the precedent it has set for improving fish welfare in regions where this had never been done before. What would a marginal donation of $50 fund? All donations we receive go into our general operating fund, which is used to fund all of the expenses outlined in ourbudget. For this reason, rather than thinking about one specific outcome that an additional donation would fund, we think it’s more accurate to think of a small donation as funding a corresponding percent of our annual budget and all theoutcomeswe intend to achieve with it.","text",11
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/donate","It might also be helpful to think about a marginal donation as funding a certain amount of fishes helped in expectation, as per the overall cost effectiveness of the organization. So for instance, a $50 donation to FWI in expectation improves the lives of roughly about 50 fishes.","text",12
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/donate","If you’re interested in what a donation would cover were it directly restricted to our implementation programs, a $50 donation could cover— ​ Visits to11farms once to analyze water quality and provide corrective actions (if needed). 11%of the cost of all equipment for one Data Collector (who can cover five farms per day). Who else has supported FWI? As of April 2024, FWI has been the recipient of six grants from theEffective Altruism Funds. In September 2022, FWI was awarded a $250,000 two-year grant fromOpen Philanthropy. We were also especially honored to be the recipient of part of the $1 million Berggruen Prize that ethicist Peter Singer received and subsequentlygave away; Singer’s ideas inspired FWI’s work perhaps more than those of any other individual. Additionally, FWI is proud to be recommended byAnimal Charity EvaluatorsandFarmKind. We are also honored to have been the recipient of individual donations from over 300 individual people to date. What are the best argumentsfordonating to FWI? The following are some arguments in favor of donating to FWI, roughly in descending order of our view of their significance: FWI’s potential for impact: The scope of the problem we face is huge: billions of farmed fishes live in our countries of operation alone, their living conditions are often very poor, and virtually nothing has been done to address these issues so far. Furthermore, the fact that we have already had promising inroads withfarmersandother key stakeholdersin these contexts suggests that we are able to gain traction on these problems. Without any obvious limiting factors here then, we believe that, once at scale, our programming does have the potential to improve the lives of hundreds of millions, or even a billion, fishes. FWI’s current impact: We currentlyestimatethat we’ve improved the lives of over 1 million fishes.","text",13
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/donate","This makes FWI one of the most promising avenues in the world to reduce farmed fish suffering, and likely the most promising avenue in the world to reduce the suffering of farmed Indian major carp, one of the largest and most neglected species groups of farmed fishes.","text",14
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/donate","Tackling some of the animal movement’s hardest questions: If we are ever going to bring about a world that is truly humane, we will need to focus on the more neglected groups in animal farming, particularly including farmed fishes and animals farmed in informal economies. We believe that FWI’s work is demonstrating some avenues of helping these groups, and will thus enable other organizations to work more effectively on them. For instance, some of the lessons we learned in implementing our own farmer-centric work later inspired the model that Shrimp Welfare Project is pursuing in theirSustainable Shrimp Farmers of India. Movement building in Asia: Almost90%of farmed fishes, as well as the majority of farmed terrestrial animals, are in Asia. We thus believe it is critical to launch movements in Asian countries to address the suffering facing these animals, and to expand the animal movement by bringing in new people. We are proud to have hired a local team of about 17 full-time equivalent staff in India as well as contractors in China and the Philippines. We are also proud that most of these people did not work in animal protection previously, and are now more likely to have careers helping animals even after they leave FWI. What are the best argumentsagainstdonating to FWI? While we think a donation to FWI is one of the more marginally impactful uses of money, it’s not the right fit for all donors. Here’s some reasons, again in descending order of significance, as to why you may not choose to donate to FWI: Experimental, unprecedented nature of work: Even though we are five years into working, FWI is still at the moment primarily in an explore/research stage. The welfare improvements we’re making and seeking to make have never before been made at the scale or in the contexts where we intend to make them—and the evidence base on how to make such welfare improvements is sparse at best.","text",15
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/donate","All these facts have contributed to the frequent pivots we’ve made, and the challenges our current model in India faces.We areheavily investingin R&D this year to identify improved, evidence-based interventions to run in India, which will hopefully enable us to shift more to an implementation phase. However, until we have implemented and evaluated these interventions, we believe a donation to FWI should be regarded as enabling moderate but somewhat uncertain impact right now, and (hopefully) enabling much greater and more certain impact in the future.","text",16
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/donate","Possibly supporting industry intensification: It is possible that by supporting farmers in addressing water quality and disease issues, we enable more farmers to get into the business and/or to make their farms more intensive. Note though that our team has considered this issue in medium depth and do not find it particularly compelling right now, in part because our stocking density caps are designed to prevent intensification. However, we believe it is still a reasonable concern one can have. To learn more about our thoughts here,contact us. We donotthink the belief that fishes lack the ability to feel pain is a good argument against donating to FWI, as there is significant and increasingevidenceandconsensusthat fishes do feel pain like most other vertebrates. Improve the lives of billions of fishes? Is that even possible? We dream big, but yes, we do think so. This is partly a testament to the vast scope of aquaculture: smaller farms hold thousands of fishes, while the largest ones hold over a million. Therefore, with fishes, even working at just the farm level means that you can impact the lives of a massive number of individuals. Although we currently impact only one fish per dollar, we intend to find more cost-effective ways of working in the future, allowing us to reach thousands or tens of thousands of farms (analogously, see the impact ofcage-free corporate advocacy for chickens). Working in this way, over the next 5–10 years we hope and expect to surpass over a billion fish helped by scaling across India and across other regions of Asia.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/do-tolerance","Third R&D Study of 2024: Dissolved Oxygen Tolerance Assessment By Dr. Paul Monaghan, Fish Welfare Initiative Research & Development Lead Summary Dissolved oxygen (DO) is considered the key water quality parameter by FWI, and many corrective actions recommended to farmers by FWI are based on DO levels. Few studies have been conducted to determine the oxygen requirements of Indian major carps (IMCs), the primary beneficiaries of FWI in India. Given the sparsity of published data about IMCs, we seek greater confidence for the DO ranges we apply as a proxy for fish welfare. We also seek greater confidence for acceptable tolerance levels of ammonia. This post discusses a study that we began today, and which will run for the next two months at our new test facility, to understand the levels of DO and ammonia which IMCs can tolerate without exhibiting welfare concerns. In order to improve its programming, FWI isinvestingmore in R&D this year. We will be running several studies throughout the course of the year in order to inform improvements to our programming, and will keep our blog updated with our progress. Background FWI’s core program, theAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture(ARA), focuses on improving water quality in fish farms. This program centers on our ground teams collecting water quality data from farms and providing the farmers with corrective actions in the event of key water quality parameters indicating that fishes may be exposed to poor conditions. Dissolved oxygen (DO) is considered the key water quality parameter by FWI, and many decisions by FWI around fish welfare are based on DO levels. ARA ground teams issuecorrective actionsto farmers when DO is outside of FWI’s recommended range of 3-5 mg/L (based on measurements taken in the morning).","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/do-tolerance","Indian major carp (IMCs)—the primary fishes targeted by FWI in India—are considered quite tolerant to DO compared to many other fishes, but few studies have been conducted to determine their oxygen requirements.Given the sparsity of published data about IMCs and how they are or are not impacted by specific water quality parameters—in particular, DO—is FWI confident in the recommended DO range that it has set?","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/do-tolerance","As FWI aspires to be an evidence-based organization, the evidence for the DO range utilized for decision-making needs to be strengthened. To generate this evidence, FWI is conducting a study to understand the levels of DO which IMCs can tolerate without welfare concerns. Additionally, this study will be looking at tolerable levels of ammonia. Ammonia is known to impact DO levels in water, and arecent studyby FWI suggests that the combination of ammonia and DO may be a more important indicator of fish welfare than DO alone. A study that takes into account the dynamics of water quality, particularly the interplay of DO and ammonia, would help us understand if DO on its own is a suitable proxy for fish welfare, and/or if there is a need to refine the water quality conditions—specifically, the combination of DO and ammonia levels—which should trigger our decisions to recommend corrective actions to farmers. Hypothesis If we conduct laboratory-based experiments to ascertain the DO levels which IMCs can tolerate without welfare concerns, we would obtain empirical data to inform if FWI’s focus on DO is justified, or needs to be reconsidered. If it confirms that DO is a justified concern, the study would inform the lowest level of DO at which corrective actions should be issued as part of the ARA, and how ammonia can be factored into this decision-making. Research Question We have two research questions with this study: What is the lowest level of DO which IMCs can tolerate without exhibiting welfare concerns? How does DO tolerance for IMCs change with varying levels of ammonia? Our Plans On this post’s date ofpublication, July 10, we have initiated a study to provide empirical evidence to inform our decisions around the need to refine the water quality conditions—specifically, the combination of DO and ammonia levels—which should trigger our decisions to recommend corrective actions to farmers.","text",4
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/do-tolerance","Due to the requirement to carefully control parameters—namely, DO and ammonia—this study is being conducted in a laboratory setting, not in aquaculture ponds. We are conducting this study in our custom-built test facilities hosted at our university partner Adikavi Nannaya University (AKNU) in Rajamahendravaram, Andhra Pradesh. Last year we constructed six test ponds in collaboration with AKNU in order to enable us to test different practices in controlled, farm-like conditions (we have recently initiated astudy to test fortified feedin these test ponds). We recently expanded this test facility to include a laboratory housing a number of tanks to allow us conduct experiments that require even more refined control of environmental conditions than is possible in a pond.","text",5

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/do-tolerance","The study will utilize six 500 L tanks, three for experimental conditions and three for controls. The study will be conducted in phases over the course of a approximately two months: Thefirst phase—designed to determine the lowest level of DO which IMCs can tolerate without exhibiting welfare issues—will involve slowly and incrementally reducing the DO levels in experimental tanks, while keeping the DO levels constant in the control tanks. Thesecond phase—designed to determine how IMC’s tolerance for DO changes with varying levels of ammonia—will involve keeping DO constant (at the lowest tolerated levels identified through the first phase), but slowly and incrementally increasing the levels of ammonia in experimental tanks, while keeping the ammonia levels constant in the control tanks. Data, including water quality parameters and welfare indicators, will be collected throughout. Fishes will be carefully and constantly monitored throughout the study, and will be transferred to a tank with more optimal conditions once data indicates they are stressed. Beyond the stress they experience from exposure to low DO levels,no fishes will be intentionally harmed or killed in or after the study. After the conclusion of the study, the fishes will be released into the nearby Godavari River (we have obtained permission from local authorities for this wild release). The study protocol has received ethical approval from AKNU’s Institutional Ethical Committee. The study will be conducted over the course of a number of weeks. Time is required to allow fishes to acclimate to the tanks before starting each phase of the study. All phases of the study are expected to be finalized by the end of August, with preliminary results expected in September. We’re conducting this study in keeping with our commitment to evidence-based decision making.","text",7
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/do-tolerance","Regardless of the results, the data from this study will inform our programming—data may indicate that our existing DO thresholds are correct, or need to be changed.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/china-scoping","Fish Welfare Scoping Report: China By Isla Gibson, Tse Yip Fai, and Marco Cerqueira Interested in putting research into action? We encourage any organization or industry interested in engaging with fish welfare in China tocontact us. We are able to offer consultation in the development of fish welfare standards, and support in the form of training, endorsement, and overseas trips. ​ Executive Summary Aquaculture is the fastest growing food production sector,​ with an estimated 73 to 180 billion farmed fish alive at any given moment.​ In 2018, the Chinese domestic aquaculture industry was valued at nearly 900 billion yuan, with aquaculture representing almost 1% of total Chinese GDP.​ Today, China accounts for nearly 70% of the world’s total aquaculture production,​ enabling the livelihoods of five million domestic workers.​ Chinese aquaculture distinguishes itself by not only its contributions to global production, but also its technical and scientific achievements in disease control, low-carbon farming systems, hatchery techniques, and commitment to its low-carbon, “green” development philosophy.​ By 2030, China is likely to produce an additional 6-18 million tonnes of aquatic products–an increase of 9-27%–to satisfy projected domestic consumption. ​ This report aims to summarize the current welfare of farmed fish in China to better understand the world’s leading producer, exporter, and consumer of aquaculture products. In order to identify possible avenues for improving fish welfare, we conducted a detailed review of the relevant literature in both industry and academia, as well as a brief survey of the welfare conditions of a select number of species using internet-based anecdotal evidence.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/china-scoping","We also consulted a variety of experts from relevant organizations to deepen our qualitative understanding and produce the following conclusions: Of China’s diverse aquaculture systems, pond culture dominates both freshwater and marine aquaculture and accounts for 72.7% of the world’s freshwater systems. In comparison with other major aquaculture-producing nations, there is a relatively low dominance of any one farmed finfish species.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/china-scoping","China is a particularly strong candidate to lead in operationalizing the welfare-minded aquaculture of the future due to the scale and diverse composition of the Chinese aquaculture sector, the latest fisheries policies as expressed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA), and the support scaffolding provided by government bodies and research institutions. Of the various welfare concerns associated with aquaculture in China, mitigating the stress connected to disease rates, water quality, inappropriate slaughter practices, and the high mortality rates associated with transport may all be effective in improving the lives of a large number of animals. These are areas in which the well-being of the fish and the financial interests of the farmer align. Animal welfare work in China has become an increasingly accessible space in recent years, particularly through the development of species-specific certification schemes and through the work of organizations like the International Cooperation Committee of Animal Welfare (ICCAW). This presents a promising avenue for working with large to medium-scale producers willing to spearhead this new trend in corporate responsibility and sustainable aquaculture. We conclude with a list ofrecommendationsfor future fish welfare work in China.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/densities","When Things Go Wrong: Addressing a Flaw in our Stocking Density Monitoring This post is a little shorter and more narrative than our usual blog style, but we are interested in exploring publishing more, shorter posts that give an insight into our work. Feel free toreach outor leave a comment below if you'd like to see more or less posts like this going forwards. Like other farmed animals, farmed fishes suffer when they are placed in overcrowded conditions: Research has consistently shown that poor stocking densities can lead to numerous welfare issues, including stress, susceptibility to disease, and aggressive behaviors. For this reason, part of FWI's currentfarmer askis to maintain a fish stocking density not exceeding 3,000 fish per acre, which is what our research suggests to be best for fish welfare while also considering the economic feasibility. To monitor compliance, we gather data on two fronts: the size of the farmers' earthen ponds and their stocked fish count. By dividing the number of fish by the pond area, we calculate the stocking density. However, the accuracy of this calculation hinges on the accuracy of the data provided. A recent review, initiated by a vigilant member of our team (shoutout to Paul here), revealed a significant discrepancy: Many farmers were reporting the total size of their property, which, in most cases, is larger than the actual size of the ponds. This oversight led to a miscalculation of stocking densities, which, in the case of 58 partner farms, resulted in densities exceeding our recommended limits. To rectify this, we are using Google Earth to more accurately determine the actual area of the farms' ponds (assuming a consistent depth of approximately 2 meters). Additionally, we are enhancing the reliability of our fish stocking data by verifying the stocking receipts provided by the farmers.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/densities","However, obtaining precise data is only a part of the broader challenge, as ensuring farmer compliance remains a significant hurdle. In particular, we expect that many farmers will be reluctant to reduce their fish densities without additional incentives, having operated successfully at higher densities. Our team is currently exploring strategies to incentivize compliance, and once a viable solution is identified we will update our programs accordingly. Recent Posts","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/climate-change-aquaculture-and-fish-welfare","Climate Change, Aquaculture, and Fish Welfare Updated:Aug 19, 2020 Note: We acknowledge the fact that climate change is a complex issue and hard to predict. Forecasting climate change’s impacts on aquaculture is equally complex. This blog post is based on carefully selected studies and suggests the potential impacts of climate change on farmed fish. We live in a time of a changing climate. Some places become increasingly hot and dry, while others flood (IPCC, 2014). In 2013, extremely high temperatures led to massive fish kills for milkfish farmers in the Philippines (White, 2013). Hot temperatures stress fish and can destroy farmers' livelihoods by eradicating whole stocks (White, 2013). But not only the Philippines are affected. Fish farmers around the world note the rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and increasingly challenging farming conditions. In the past few years, the aquaculture sector started further exploring the effects of climate change on farmed fish. The resulting message is clear: “The issues relating to climate change can significantly affect the welfare of farm animals” (RSPCA, 2015). We can prepare fish to withstand the changes ahead by improving their resilience.And the key to better resilience is higher welfare. The world is changing ... Long, dry, hot summer months followed by sudden temperature changes and flooding - this is global warming messing with our climate. Increasingly severe storms and bigger waves damage open ocean fish farms and make it hard for farmers to reach their facilities to tend to fishes’ needs (Barange et al., 2018- Chapter 23). Farmers keeping their fish in inland ponds are also not spared from climate change, as floods and droughts can deteriorate water quality in their ponds (Peck et al., 2020;Holmyard, 2014).","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/climate-change-aquaculture-and-fish-welfare","Open ocean sea cages like this cobia fish farm in Vietnam are at significant risk of destruction from extreme weather events. Furthermore, warmer air means warmer water, both in inland and offshore fish farms (Holmyard, 2014). The problem with warmer water is that it holds less oxygen. To survive, fish need oxygen as much as humans, and small-sized ponds and lakes especially run the risk of oxygen depletion (Barange et al., 2018- Chapter 1). High temperatures also increase the risk of algal blooms. These can be either toxic (harmful algal bloom) or non-toxic. During toxic blooms, a sudden increase in plankton and algae depletes the water of its oxygen, frequently creating “dead zones” (i.e., zones of low oxygen levels, unsuitable for marine life). Scientists have found that if temperatures increase by 5°C, we can lose up to 60% of the 694 fish species they investigated (Vaughan, 2020).","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/climate-change-aquaculture-and-fish-welfare","Higher temperatures deplete oxygen in the water. Low oxygen levels leave fish in a constant state of suffocation. … with serious implications for farmed fish. Amidst all these changes live billions of fish. Each species thrives in specific water temperature ranges. If temperature changes permanently remain outside of a fish’s tolerable range, they enter a constant state of stress, also calledallostatic overload. Combating stress requires energy, so fish will compensate for this energy loss by eating more. Feed already accounts for 25-85% of production costs without this added stress (Rola & Hasan, 2007). Increased hunger is not only stressful for the fish, but also requires farmers to invest more money in feed. Another side effect of increased stress is suppressed immune function. Remember the last time you were in the middle of a stressful project? Perhaps you got sick with a cold as your body reacted to little sleep and a lot of cortisol (the stress hormone). Fish are no different. They can only cope with excessive stress for so long before their immune system weakens. This eventually leaves them increasingly vulnerable to diseases and parasites that they would have combated well under normal circumstances (Holmyard, 2014). The biggest challenge of climate change lies in more frequent and more intense disease and parasite outbreaks.And the usual answer to more disease is the use of more antibiotics. Chilean salmon producers already give their fish over ten times more antibiotics than are used for chickens (Scott, 2019). High doses of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance both in fish and humans - a concerning side-effect of global warming in aquaculture (Reverter et al., 2020).","text",6

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/climate-change-aquaculture-and-fish-welfare","Stress leads to a weakened immune system and the need for medical treatment. A cycle that can be broken by improving welfare. Logistical impacts Wild fish are affected by these developments as much as farmed fish. During past extreme weather events, the price for prey species such as anchovy has almost doubled (Bertrand et al., 2020). These species are processed into fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO), which is then fed to carnivorous fish in fish farms. Reduced availability and higher prices of FMFO could push farmers to either farm fewer carnivorous species or change fishes’ diet altogether. If feeding is not adjusted in the fish's best interest, less or different feed can leave them hungry. Climate change may interrupt the freshwater supply in many areas. As water becomes more scarce, different sectors will compete over this resource (FAO, 2020,Barange et al., 2018- Chapter 21). Aquaculture systems relying on external freshwater input will feel this shortage. Furthermore, fish farming and processing requires boats, trucks, and other machines that rely on gasoline. With reduced future availability, oil prices will likely rise, forcing aquaculture facilities to find alternative methods of transport to keep costs down. Who is most affected? Fishes in open aquaculture operations such as sea cages, ponds, and raceways are directly exposed to the elements, and therefore the forces of climate change. Extensive aquaculture systems (e.g., small, backyard ponds) are particularly vulnerable because farmers generally spend little time monitoring and controlling such systems. Changes in water quality or poor welfare indicators can thus be missed easily. On the other hand, highly controlled systems such asRecirculating Aquaculture Systemshave more control over changing environmental parameters and can regulate temperatures and oxygen content accordingly.","text",8
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/climate-change-aquaculture-and-fish-welfare","Some fishes may also experience short-term positive results when, for example, they are farmed in areas that are usually too cold for them. Yellowtail Kingfish struggle during the colder winter months in South Australia and may find warmer winters favorable. Of course, this only holds true as long as the summer temperatures stay within their tolerable range (Kolkovski & Sakakura, 2004).","text",9
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/climate-change-aquaculture-and-fish-welfare","Specific impacts will vary across regions and with species’ individual requirements.The fact that climate change impacts some species more than others may induce a shift in the species farmed, increasing the pressure on more resilient species. This shift in farmers’ focus holds serious welfare risks because some species can tolerate inappropriate conditions without indicating their discomfort. What can we do? Climate change is a complex problem that will have to be addressed by the international community. However, even if emissions stopped today, global warming will not halt. Farmers need to take action today to alleviate the stress on farmed fish in the future: Improving fish welfare right now Checking the water quality and environmental parameters at least once per day to identify any changes and immediately alleviate risks. Reducing stocking densities to minimize infection spread and allow fish to recover more quickly. Reducing the overall stress on fish to make them more resilient. Appropriate feed, minimal handling, adequate water quality, and the presence of positive experiences are just a few ways to improve resilience and brace aquaculture for the increased stressors ahead. Planning ahead: When building a new facility, farmers should work with scientists to determine the future long-term climate change impacts in the desired area. Changing tactics: Farmers could farm more omnivorous species to avoid reliance on FMFO, a feed source that may become scarce and expensive.","text",10

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/trial-run","Our First Successful Corporate Trial Run Updated:Feb 21 By Upasana Sarraju and Subrata Deb Earlier this year, weshared our thinkingbehind restructuring internally to form a new Farmer Engagement department and prioritize farmer-centric work. This change in strategy was intended to contextualize our corporate work as part of the broader project of transitioning farms: if fish-procuring corporations that mandate higher-welfare practices establish direct market linkages with farmers,farmers are more incentivized to meet the welfare mandates.This approach, however, had not been validated at the time of the restructuring. Now, in the second quarter of 2023, we are excited to share that we successfully conducted our first trial run. In April,Captain Fresh, an Indian seafood corporation working with 500,000 retailers and individual sellers, procured fishes due to our mediation from a higher-welfare farm belonging to anAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture(ARA) farmer in Andhra Pradesh, India. This post details the process. Why Pursue Corporate Trial Runs","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/trial-run","Our work to improve the lives of farmed fishes brings us into contact with different participants in the aquaculture supply chain. In a simplified sense, the main participants are farmers, corporations, and consumers: Farmerscan regulate the quality of water that fishes live in, ensure fishes receive proper nutrition and medical care, and fulfill the unique needs of each species living in a farm. Farmers in Andhra Pradesh sell fishes to local traders who sort the fishes by species, size, quality, and weight. This selling price is set based on the market price—a highly variable quantity. Corporationspurchase large quantities of these sorted and graded fishes from traders (and directly from farmers, on occasion) at a higher price than what the traders paid to procure the fishes. Corporations ""process"" the fishes into various products. Consumerspurchase processed fishes and fish-based products from corporations for consumption. Our direct farmer work empowers farmers to maintain a higher level of welfare for fishes in their farms: ensuring recommended dissolved oxygen levels, judicious use of chemical inputs, proper feeding regimens, preparing and maintaining the ponds themselves, fighting disease, etc. For long-term and stable welfare improvements, we need to be able to provide farmers a strong incentive to continue supporting higher fish welfare in their farms. We believe that we may have a greaterimpacton fishes’ lives and be able to incentivize more farmers to implement ourrecommended farming practicesif higher fish welfare becomes a prerequisite for farms before any fishes can be sold or bought. A successful welfare-centric linkage between the aquaculture market and aquaculture farms could help us reduce the suffering of many farmed fishes.","text",4
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/trial-run","A corporate trial run thus evidences the idea that it is possible to directly link farmers to corporations in favor of more reliable procurement, better resilience to changing market conditions, and, most importantly, higher fish welfare.","text",5
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/trial-run","The First Steps We defined our primary and secondary objectives of this trial run as: Learn what it takes to initiate, facilitate, and conduct successful procurement of fishes by a corporation from a higher-welfare farm. Identify the most pressing fish welfare concerns through the entire process. Provide technological and technical inputs to the procurement process and observe its impact on reducing the fishes’ suffering. Use the learnings to determine if market linkages are viable, impactful for higher fish welfare, and replicable across Indian aquaculture. From here, we began identifying potential corporate partners and their policies that govern how, why, and where procurement of fishes is performed. A typical ""harvest"" process in progress at a fish farm in Andhra Pradesh, India. Large nets are used to gather fishes to a corner of the farm. This is followed by the manual removal of fishes from water—asphyxiation, particularly when prolonged until death, causes fishes pain and suffering. Bringing Together Stakeholders In early March, we met with three fish-procuring corporations that expressed interest in supporting our higher-welfareARAfarms. Captain Fresh, acorporate partnerof FWI since September 2022, was one such corporation whose procurement policies and interests aligned best with the conditions that an ARA farmer could meet. We performed a similar review of farmers in the ARA. Farmers were first evaluated based on the size of their farm, number of fishes reared in the farm, stage of the farming cycle, reliability, and interest in participating in the trial run. Nine farmers were shortlisted. Among them, three farmers from Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, expressed interest in engaging with corporations and confirmed that the fishes reared in their farms would be ready for “harvest” by the end of April 2023. We invited representatives from Captain Fresh and the three ARA farmers to meet at our Nellore office.","text",6

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/trial-run","In Indian aquaculture, the main points of contention between farmers, traders, and fish-procuring corporations tend to be: The average body size or weight of fishes in the farm. The marginal profit for farmers (which should support and exceed the costs of farming activities, farm inputs, and labor throughout one aquaculture cycle, that lasts for approximately nine months in case of Indian major carp). The quality of fishes in the farm (visible signs of disease, injuries, malnutrition, parasitic infections, chemical overexposure are some factors involved in ascertaining the quality of farmed fishes). The minimum number of fishes (measured by total or average weight instead of by number of individuals) required to be harvested. Species-specific requirements for weight and quality control. How soon and how reliably money is disbursed to farmers. Cost of executing the harvest. While we were successful in bringing together aquaculture stakeholders, in the end, we identified only one ARA farmer whose willingness to participate, farm characteristics, and fish population status suited Captain Fresh’s negotiated policies. The Trial Run In the last week of April, the trial was successfully executed in an ARA farm in that has been implementing our recommended higher-welfare practices and corrective actions for over a year in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India. For a typical harvest, fishes are gathered to one corner of the farm using a large net and removed from the water by hand. This is done by laborers who often cannot afford protective gear such as proper work boots and durable gloves. The excessive and rough handling causes fishes immense stress as they are still alive at this point. Further, the handling increases occurrences of injuries to the fishes and the workers, increasing chances of pathogen and disease transmission.","text",8

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/trial-run","For this trial run, Captain Fresh utilized a machine provided by FAIVRE, a French manufacturing company. This machine, capable of removing fishes from water and sorting their bodies by size, demonstrated higher efficiency by reducing the harvesting time to nearly one-fifth of the conventional approach. For instance, when handling fishes collectively weighing over two tons, the traditional harvesting method would have taken approximately 2.5 to 3.5 hours. With the machine, the process was completed in less than 45 minutes. This significant time reduction contributed to minimizing post-harvest stress experienced by fishes, limiting handling of fishes, and reducing potential injuries to fishes. Using new technology in the field can reduce fish suffering; however, many other compounding aspects, such as themethods used to cause deathin harvested fishes, remained unresolved. Our Learnings and Plans The successful trial to establish linkages between ARA farmers and corporate procurement channels represents an encouraging development. This trial run validated the feasibility of such linkages and underscored the significance of effective planning and coordination among diverse stakeholders. We also believe that the trial showcased the potential for transformative impact in introducing better technology and enhancing welfare outcomes for fishes. Moving forward, we will continue to investigate the role of market linkages in scaling the ARA and conduct more trial runs across other field sites to deepen our understanding of potential roadblocks. We aim for any future strategy to consider limitations such as farm locations and access by road, quality control, market price fluctuations, delays in payment disbursement, climate, and disease outbreaks. We hope to continue expanding our corporate connections to incentivize many more farms to take up higher-welfare practices.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2020-in-review","Our 2020 Year in Review Updated:Feb 21 2020 was Fish Welfare Initiative’s first full year of operations. In it, FWI changed significantly: we shifted from focusing primarily on research to focusing primarily on institutional outreach and on-the-ground implementation. We set ourstrategyin India, and hired our first staff member there. And similar to other organizations, the COVID-19 pandemic presented challenges we never anticipated. Our mission is to improve the welfare of fish as much as possible. In this post, we discuss to what extent we’ve succeeded in living up to this goal. We’re writing this for the sake of transparency and accountability, and in the hope that our successes (and failures) can provide useful insight to other similar organizations. Below is an outline of what we discuss. We have aimed to provide a thorough account, and readers should thus feel free to skip around to whichever part(s) most interest them. 2020 Plan Estimated Impact and Accomplishments 2020 Goals Budget and Financial Information Staff Changes Operational Successes Operational Mistakes Impact of COVID-19 Looking Ahead to 2021 2020 Plan At its simplest, FWI’s approach can be summed up as the following (essentially theexplore-exploit tradeoff): Identify the most promising ways of helping fish. Implement those. In 2020, our focus was largely the former. Wesought to identifythe most promising country, species, approach, and welfare improvement(s) for our fish welfare work (seeOperational Mistakesfor more commentary on this). Through ourresearch, we determined what we believe to be satisfactory answers to these questions, and are now thus working with local NGOs to implement water quality improvements (amongst other changes) for farmed carp in India. You can read more about what we planned for 2020 in our2020 plan. Estimated Impact and Accomplishments We judge our work based on its impact.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2020-in-review","Unfortunately, we do not have any numbers to share with you as for the number of fish we helped in 2020. This is both because our primary focus was on research, not implementation, and because the direct impact-focused projects we did undertake had impacts that were sufficiently difficult to quantify such that we do not think it would be helpful to attempt such an estimate.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2020-in-review","We believe the following are our most significant accomplishments in 2020: Building a plan for work in India. We believe that our approach andplanin India will enable FWI, starting this year, to be one of the most cost effective avenues of helping animals available. With our recentpartnership, it is showing early signs of success. Research. We completed tenresearch projects. These included scoping reports on China, the Philippines, India, and Vietnam, a guest report on the welfare of farmed salmon, and our flagship “Fish Welfare Improvements in Aquaculture” report, which we believe to be the only report to date to thoroughly discuss welfare improvements for Indian species. While the primary purpose of our research is to inform our own decision-making, we hope that other organizations will find it useful as well. Hiring. We grew our team from 2 to 5 full-time staff, and added several interns and contractors. This included hiring a Managing Director for our work in India. Our staff are our most valuable resource. Farm Visits. We visited over 40 farms in India, as well as farms or markets in Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Nigeria, the US, and Germany. We believe these visits are critical for actually understanding the conditions of farmed fish as well as the situations of those who make a living farming them. Collaboration with other organizations. We’re proud to have collaborated with and helped enable the work of several other organizations, including the Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organizations, World Animal Protection, the Aquatic Animal Alliance, the Aquatic Life Institute, Straw India, and Mercy for Animals. 2020 Goals As per ourplan, the following were our goals for 2020. Below each is our assessment of its completion (seeOperational Mistakesfor more commentary). Goal 1:Conclude initiative research and publish report(s) with preliminary answers to our 4 questions (priority country, species, welfare improvement, and approach). Status: Completed.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2020-in-review","Goal 2:Be implementing welfare improvements on 1-4 farms and measuring and evaluating this. Status: Not completed.We expect this to be occurring by this May with the launch of our pilot study. We significantly underestimated how long this would take, which was further exacerbated by our insufficient understanding of the complexity involved in robustly making welfare improvements (seeOperational Mistakes). Goal 3:Gain some early impact wins (i.e. somewhere where we can find a relatively simple lever to reduce fish suffering). Status: Completed(although the goal is vague). We consider our work withStraw Indiato develop educational materials on fish welfare for school children to fulfill this category, as well as our participation in theAquatic Animal Allianceto improve certification scheme standards. Goal 4:Establish in country (with at least 1 in country staff). Status: Completed. We hiredKarthik Pulugurthato be our Managing Director in India. Goal 5:Establish a strong positive team culture that is intensely dedicated, goal-oriented, kind, and fun (i.e. on a survey question “How would you rank FWI’s overall team culture?”, the average score is at least a 4 out of 5).","text",6

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2020-in-review","Status: Somewhat completed.We altered our internal survey to later ask specifically for each of the desired traits. The following are our scores in the latest team-wide internal survey: As we believe in both the instrumental and intrinsic value of a fun workplace, we are currently thinking of ways to make FWI more fun. Goal 6:Register as a legal charitable organization. Status: Not completed. We submitted our Form 1023 to the IRS in August, and as of this writing are still awaiting our letter of determination (seeOperational Mistakes). Update: We received our letter of determination in early February, and now have our 501(c)3 status. Goal 7:Have strong industry connections (i.e. there are at least 10 people in industry that FWI knows well and could reasonably ask a favor of). Status: Completed. Budget and Financial Information In 2020, FWI had an annual turnover of $150,000. About 68% of this went to programming (primarily research for the first three quarters, and then shifting to work in India in the final quarter), 30% to admin/hiring, and 2% to fundraising. You can learn more in our2020 budget. In 2021, we are estimating anannual budgetof $330,000. Our funding in 2020 primarily came from a couple major gifts, including two grants from theEA Animal Welfare Fund, and a grant to fund our Philippines scoping work fromWorld Animal Protection. We also had an increasing number of smaller donations supporting our work. Our donor demographic primarily consisted of supporters of the Effective Altruism and animal protection movements. In 2021 and the coming years, we are putting more energy into diversifying our funding base. We are extremely grateful to those individuals and organizations who donate. You enable our work--our impact is your impact. Staff Changes FWI began the year with only its cofounders, Tom and Haven.","text",8
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2020-in-review","During 2020, we hiredthree additional full-time staff:Jennifer, our Research and Project Strategist, Marco, our Fish Welfare Specialist, and Karthik, our Managing Director in India.","text",9
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2020-in-review","We were also pleased to be able to work part-time with Isla Gibson and Ethel Wagas on our scoping reports, and to have worked with a number of talented interns: Caleb Rose, Nia Personette, Jay Stonestreet, Jasti Sriram Kumar, and Naresh Rathod. We said a sad goodbye to Sophia Babb, our Communications Specialist, who left in the fall. We're grateful for all the work that Sophia did at FWI. We are also grateful to all the volunteers who regularly support our work. If you are interested in volunteering, considersigning up to our database. Operational Successes The following are a few of the elements of FWI that we believe have been most critical for our success: Hiring full-time staff slowly and deliberately. Much of the advice we’ve heard on hiring has said to hire slowly. And with our5-6 stage hiring processes, that is what we have done. We believe that most of our success is due to the talented people we’ve been able to attract and identify, people whom we may not have selected in a less rigorous process. (Although two caveats on this point: First, we don’t actually know the counterfactuals, so this argument is mostly based on intuition and should be viewed as such. Second, we are generally in favor of hiringtemporarystaffquickly, as needs arise.) Building relationships on the ground in India. At this point we have completed a number of field visits in India, and we believe this has been critical to demonstrate to our current and potential partners that we are worth collaborating with. Relationship building with a variety of organizations, not just those currently involved in animal protection, has been crucial. Collaborating widely within the animal protection movement, especially in India. In our first visit to India, we made a point of meeting with as many of the local animal protection organizations as we could.","text",10
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2020-in-review","In addition to understanding their views on fish welfare work, we also aimed to understand whether they thought FWI would add value by conducting such work in India. As we’ve conducted farm visits, hired a managing director, and began our own local legal incorporation, their advice has significantly improved our work.","text",11
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2020-in-review","Operational Mistakes We believe that the following were the biggest mistakes we made in 2020. We intend to improve on each in the future. In some ways, we were too systematic. In an ideal world, we would have all the time we needed to research the best ways of helping fish before acting. But that is not our world: farmed fish (and many other sentient individuals) are suffering now. We now believe that we spent too much time on our initial research. A large part of this issue arose from our earlier focus on more context-independent research: for instance, we researched a number of different fish species, when the reality is that the target species must be largely dependent on the region. Our annual goals were not actually useful in guiding action, and were not widely known to the team. We believe that goals are only valuable to the degree that they either inspire or inform action. Our 2020 goals, as listed above, were not particularly effective at achieving either. Additionally, our team was not very familiar with our goals. We believe our currentObjectives and Key Resultsare much more valuable for both informing and inspiring action. All of our full-time staff have key results they are tasked with achieving, and their performance is primarily evaluated based on their success in achieving them. We believe this creates greater ownership. We grossly underestimated how long some projects would take. For instance, as part of our annual goals we hadplannedto launch a pilot study last summer, but that has still yet to begin (it’s now scheduled for May of this year). There were several other examples of this, especially with research projects. We believe that a large part of this failure is due to us not properly visualizing all the steps that needed to occur for a project to succeed. To correct for this, one technique that has helped is enumerating the specific milestones and mini-deadlines needed for the completion of a project.","text",12
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2020-in-review","These can be further visualized with a dependency chart.","text",13
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2020-in-review","We waited too long to file our 501(c)(3) in the US. We filed in August, and as of this writing are still awaiting our determination letter. Not having the 501(c)(3) status, and subsequently operating through a fiscal sponsor, creates somewhat more operational expenses. We recommend that other organizations in similar positions file early, andexpedite the processif they can. Impact of COVID-19 The pandemic began to seriously impact our work in March, at which point we were midway through our initial field visits in India. COVID-19 had a couple impacts on our work: Instead of conducting further field visits and scoping reports with our current staff, the pandemic led us to hire local contractors to complete the work. This caused certain delays, and limited the number of countries we could seriously consider. However, given the added benefits that working with a local contractor brought, we now believe that this is an avenue we should have utilized more from the beginning. The pandemic also increased the logistical and financial cost of our field work in India, as it became harder to safely meet with people and more expensive to safely travel. Looking Ahead to 2021 We are feeling optimistic about our impact going into 2021. For instance, in the first few weeks of the year we secured our firstcommitmentin India, which we believe will impact several million fish. Although much work is still required on our end, this is FWI’s greatest achievement to date, and we hope and expect the start of many more. The majority of our budget and staff hours will be focused on implementing changes with our current partner, securing additional commitments and partnerships, and demonstrating the viability of ourwelfare improvementsin a formal study.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2024-culture-surveys","Results from our Latest Culture Surveys (April 2023 – January 2024) By Tom Billington, Fish Welfare Initiative Co-founder Summary In April 2023, July 2023, and January 2024, FWI conducted culture surveys to better understand a) how our team finds working with us, and b) how we can improve. This post presents findings from all three surveys. We know posting the results of our internal culture survey on our blog is somewhat unorthodox, but we do it in keeping with our organizational value of honesty and transparency. General satisfaction levels among team members stands at 8.2/10 as of January 2024. All three surveys highlighted camaraderie among colleagues and making a meaningful impact as consistently the best aspects of work at FWI. Enjoyment of the work itself was also highlighted. The main dislike of the team was intense/hard work, although this was highlighted less in the most recent January 2024 survey. Other issues, such as rushing decisions / projects and poor team-wide communication / collaboration appear to tie especially to our many strategic shifts over the last year and ourincreased uncertainty in our current impact model. We have made the following changes, which we believe will reduce these issues: All big decisions have a period of review with the team Leadership are focusing more on employee relations and culture You can find the anonymized raw data for all three surveyshere.","text",2

Best and Worst Aspects of Working at FWI First, a note on the format of the surveys. In April and July, both the “Like Best” and “Like Least” questions were formatted as an open text box. In January 2024, this was changed to a checklist where other options could be given. This change was made in order to save the team time and to test out ways to boost the number of responses given. However, this does mean that the January survey is less directly comparable to the prior surveys, and as such our analysis below focuses predominantly on the larger trends found between the three surveys.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2024-culture-surveys","Long and intense work hours have consistently been the most cited issuesince we began surveying. In the January 2024 survey, however, only one person selected this (the first time it has not been the top issue). It is too early to tell if this trend will continue, but we think it could be due to changes in management and better setting of plans and work expectations. Rushing decisions and projects, as well as poor team-wide communication and collaboration were the next most cited issues. Both were particularly highly chosen in January 2024, although this was likely influenced by a format shift in the survey. Uncertainty of impact was concerningly high (the joint fourth highest-cited issue). This makes sense given thelimitations with our current model, though we also feel that this is a symptom of poor communication from the leadership team as to the benefits of that model (which we still believe to be one of the best ways to positively influence fish lives currently available in low and middle income contexts). Changes We've Made The following are some changes we've made in response to these surveys: All big decisions now have a period of review with the team.Poor communication and insufficient team involvement in major decisions is something that came up in the January 2024 survey as well as in conversations with team members. We previously made a commitment to not make large decisions without the team reviewing them, but feel that we could have done better at applying this. As such, we are reaffirming our commitment to ensuring the relevant team members have a chance to give their opinion before any large decision is made. Leadership are focusing more on employee relations and culture.Since the beginning of 2024, Tom (Co-founder), Karthik (Managing Director of India), and Abhishek (Associate Director of India) have been leading efforts on improving FWI culture.","text",10
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2024-culture-surveys","For example, we are revamping FWI’s values and we have created meetings for manager training and knowledge sharing. Although not a direct solution to the issues presented above, we hope that greater scrutiny on how our team interacts with each other will foster an overall better environment for communication and stability. As a leadership team, we areputting more effort into accurate communication moving forward. We have also begun working with anorganizational consultantto make some improvements here, although that project is ongoing.","text",11
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2024-culture-surveys","Historically, FWI has been a place withmany strategic pivots, where plans were frequently changed across the organization and within departments. We believe these pivots are in part to be expected for projects like ours that work in novel contexts. However, as pivots do sometimes have a detrimental effect on the team, we are working to somewhat increase our staff’s feelings of stability. We have already done this by: Formalizing our R&D departmentwith a more experienced lead and longer-term research plans Accepting a strategic focus on R&D, instead of pushing for timelines of scale that are not viable for our current knowledge base Training managers to give their teams more consistency Given these, we now believe that FWI’s strategic and operational direction is more stably set. However, it is also true that FWI’s nimbleness and the novel work we do will mean that change is inevitable, and so we will also consider how to create a team culture where change is able to be better embraced.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/100-farms","Over 100 Farms Committed to Fish Welfare Updated:Feb 21 We now have over 100 fish farms actively engaging with us to improve the welfare of their fishes! Read on to learn how these farmers help their fishes and where our farmer-centric work is headed next. Committed to Welfare The farms we’re celebrating are active members of theAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture (ARA)andcommittedto improving the welfare of their fishes. As part of the ARA, farmers execute corrective actions if the farm's water quality lies outside our required ranges. It is through the implementation of our suggestions that wehelp fishes. Narasimha’s Efforts to Help His Fishes Narasimha, a fish farmer in Kolleru, India, is an excellent example of how our farmer partnerships help fishes. Narasimha joined the ARA in December 2022 and, per our guidance, reduced his stocking density by a total of 5,000 fishes. This meant more living space and the potential for improved water quality for the remaining fishes. On a recent visit to Narasimha’s farm, we measured very low dissolved oxygen levels in the morning. Further investigating his water quality, we also measured high turbidity (i.e., suspended particles in the farm water). Both measurements were cause for intervention. Low turbidity and dissolved oxygen indicate high phytoplankton levels, thus depleting the water's available oxygen. As a result, fishes have difficulty breathing, a scenario similar to us being in a room with a lot of smoke. To improve the fishes’ environment, our ground team guided Narasimha to stop feeding the fishes for 48 hours, to allow the plankton population to stabilize. We revisited the farm three days later, and found that dissolved oxygen levels had improved tothe required level. Turbidity levels had also improved but were still too high. Our ground team assumed that the plankton population in the water was excessive and thus suggested Narasimha add fresh water to his farm to further diffuse the plankton.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/100-farms","We assessed the farm's water quality after he added new water, and turbidity had decreased to the required level. Over the following months, we followed up with Narasimha and found that all water quality parameters remained in the required range, thus providing better living conditions for the fishes.","text",3

The improvements in Narasimha's farm demonstrate how strong collaborative relationships with our ARA farmers are the basis of our work and the outcome of our staff’s continuous efforts to empower farmers and thus help fishes. What’s Next? In 2024, we’re planning to add another 100 farms to the ARA (seeFWI’s annual goals). We are also working on various strategic improvements to our overall programming, which we will publish shortly. These changes will focus on catching more water quality issues to ultimately help more fish. We will also test improved water quality measurement methods to enhance the accuracy of our data and decision-making. Our expectation and hope is that these improvements will help us help fishes more efficiently, frequently, and sustainably.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2023review","Fish Welfare Initiative's 2023 in Review Message from the Cofounders In ourpreviousyear-in-review post, we wrote about how we had made significant progress in developing our interventions, and how because of that progress we were finally beginning to see specific avenues forward to scale an intervention in India to help hundreds of millions of fishes. We are now one year later, and though it was a year of significant progress in many ways, that earlier analysis now seems premature. We began 2023 withambitious scaling goalsto add 150 farmers to ourfarmer program, and to help an additional 1 million fishes. Unfortunately, largely due to increasingly-apparent limitations in our interventions, we fell short of these goals. These limitations also inspired twostrategicchangesover the course of the year, which, while needed, created instability that at times was challenging for our team. All of these things made 2023 feel like a challenging year for our programming, and for our organization more broadly. However, with ourlast strategic change, and with the improved capacity that came with it, we feel much better positioned to reach our ambition of being an evidence-based, extremely impactful and cost-effective organization. 2024 is thus beginning on a note of optimism for our team, with various causes for excitement: Our revamped research department andresearch plans; the issues we’ve identified (e.g.) and improvementswe madeand are making in the farmer program; and the strategic realignment of certain roles to better capitalize on our staffs' core competencies. With all of this,we believe 2023 is best characterized as a year of unintentional setup for FWI. We didn’t achieve most of the outcomes we intended, but we did build a number of foundations to enable us to achieve these outcomes more rigorously and sustainably this year and beyond.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2023review","We also still did reach a number of important outcomes themselves, including scaling our farmer program toover 100 farms, finishing construction on experimental ponds to be used in future research with our local university partnership, and improving the lives of anestimated450,000 fishes.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2023review","There’s no doubt that 2024 will be a critical year for our organization. This is the year where we’ll see if our bet on increasing rigor and resources going into R&D will pay off with more impactful and scalable interventions.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2023review","Key Outcomes We believe the following are the key outcomes achieved by the organization in 2023: 1 - An estimated 450,000 fishes’ lives improved: Through stocking density and water quality improvements implemented by farmers in ourAlliance For Responsible Aquaculture(ARA), we estimate that we improved the lives of 450,000 fishes who would have otherwise lived in worse conditions. For more information, you can visit ourimpact pageor seeexactlyhow this number was calculated. On some level, we believe that all of our work boils down to this number. 2 - A new and better equipped R&D Department: Though it’s a trend we have been following for a while, this year in particular we became aware that our current research process was not sufficient to enable us to reach the scale or cost effectiveness we have envisioned. For this reason, werevampedour process by hiring a new research lead (Dr. Paul Monaghan) and tasking him with setting anew research agenda. We also finished construction of experimental ponds at a local university (AKNU), which will enable us to test different practices in farm-like conditions, in a much more controlled environment than before, while also ensuring that no fishes are killed in the process.","text",8

Right: Durga Prasad, our Data Collector, conducting an analysis at our field office in Rajahmundry. 3 - A larger and more efficient farmer program: The Alliance for Responsible Aquaculture (ARA) now has105active farms, 16 more farms than at the end of the previous year. It also is running more efficiently than ever before, having made a number ofprogrammatic improvements. This program continues to be the core of our work, and our primary avenue for having an impact. 4 - Regulatory recommendations: Last year, we submitted three regulatory recommendations to the various Indian government entities: theCentral Pollution Control Board, theAnimal Welfare Board of India, and theDepartment of Fisheries. While it is currently unclear what outcomes will result from our submissions, we do expect that they sensitize policymakers to fish welfare and the challenges with fish farming, and we hope they build FWI’s recognition as experts in the domain. 5 - Continued progress in China: We conducted another in-country field visit, contributed to theBeijing Consensus conferenceto promote fish welfare, and identifiedpriority speciesfor whom to begin setting standards with our local Chinese partners (ICCAW).

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2023review","Key Challenges Likewise, we believe the following were the organization's key challenges in 2023: 1 - We underperformed our goal for fishes’ lives improved: One of our most importantOKRsfor 2023 was to improve the lives of 1.5M fishes. Unfortunately, we estimate that we only achieved about a third of that. We largely didn’t hit this goal because a) we deliberately slowed our scaling due toproblemswe identified in our programming; and b) webelievewe were stricter at estimating fish helped in 2023 than in years prior. We are working to address this issue both by considering more novel models in our farmer program, as well as by researching new interventions entirely with our R&D Department. 2 - We continued to face serious challenges in identifying promising welfare interventions: Running on-the-ground tests on fish farms has been a challenge ever sincewe first began themin India, and 2023 unfortunately continued that trend. In particular, last year we failed to achieveour goalof validating ourVersion 2 Standard—largely due to poor project management and study design on the ground, compounded by the challenging conditions of rural Indian aquaculture. These challenges have also meant that we are still more uncertain than we would like to be about the magnitude of theimprovementswe are currently making with the ARA. We have worked to address this issue by creatinga new R&D Departmentwith new leadership and new plans, as discussed above. 3 - Organizational instability, largely due to frequent pivots: FWI made two pivots in 2023:Onein Q1 to focus more on farmer-centric (and less on corporate and policy) work, andthe otherin Q4 to expand our research mandate. Both had programmatic and departmental restructuring implications, which led to significant stress and uncertainty at different points for some members of our team. We believe we have addressed this issue, largely by investing in more likely-to-last programmatic and departmental structures now.","text",13
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2023review","Additionally, we believe that we have improved on our internal communications and processes for making org-wide changes, although there is still further room for progress.","text",14
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2023review","4 - Internal culture and retention challenges: In large part due to the programmatic challenges and instability discussed above, staff culture (as reported in surveys and word of mouth) as well as retention was a greater challenge in 2023. We are now thinking much more actively about culture than previously (partially thanks to support from Sharpen Strategy), and have designated an active lead on culture (Tom, our co-founder). Culture was one aspect of the organization we didn’t deliberately attend to much when we were just a few staff members, but at 21 FTE (full-time equivalent) it seems more likely that creating a culture consistent with our values requires active attention. Operational Notes The following may be of interest for those interested in the more technical aspects of FWI’s operations. All budgets, OKRs, as well as some other documents may be found on ourTransparency Page. 2023 Start 2024 Start 2024 Planned Staff Size 21 FTE (full-time equivalent) 20 FTE (21 as of Jan 17) Expected ~30 FTE Annual Budget 2022: $630K, spent $500K 2023: $670K, spent $730K 2024: $770K Animal Charity Evaluators Recommendation Status Recommended Rolled over from last year We plan to re-apply. New staff: We were pleased to welcome the following people onto the team: Sidd (International Generalist), Mani (Field Manager), Paul (R&D Lead), Durga Prasad and Sanjay (Data Collectors), and Althy (Operations Associate). Most of these staff members are from India, while Paul is from Ireland and Althy from the Philippines. Fundraising: The vast majority of our 2023 budget came from donors in the effective altruism and animal advocacy spaces, with about 90% coming from gifts of $10,000 or more. This included the second half of our$250,000 two-year grantfrom Open Philanthropy. We were also honored to have about 50 monthly donors throughout the year. Turnover: We had higher turnover last year than usual, roughly 30% (which, for a 20-25 person organization, was significant).","text",15
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2023review","Turnover was both involuntary and voluntary, and was in part caused by the challenges we discussed above. The voluntary turnover in particular updated us to think that we need to be more deliberate about culture, employee relations, and internal communications. We’re now investing more in management courses and external consulting (though also mindful to avoid overly bureaucratizing).","text",16
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2023review","Hiring: Hiring continued to be our biggest operational bottleneck. For instance, there were several roles for which we spent significant resources hiring for but proved unable to identify any sufficiently well-fitting candidates (e.g.). It also often proved challenging to hire ground team members in rural India who met our skill qualifications.","text",17

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2023review","A Note of Conclusion and Gratitude This has been the fourth full year of operations at FWI, and our third full year operating with fish farms in India, an environment still largely unexplored by the animal advocacy movement. There have been many ups and downs along the way, and we’ve learned a lot about what it means to make changes for fishes in decentralized farming systems (the reality for the majority of farmed fishes in our world). There are problems we have better figured out how to solve (e.g. water quality) and still problems that we are far from solving (e.g. slaughter via asphyxiation). It is our hope that the foundations we laid in 2023, and the foundations we will continue laying in 2024, will bring us as well as our animal advocacy movementcloser to fully addressing these welfare issues, and closer to a world that is truly humane for all. We also wanted to thank everyone who enabled us to make the progress and the impacts we have made. In particular, that includes our donors, our advisors, and our friends and family who enable us to work for this cause. That also includes: People for Animals India Mercy for Animals India Shrimp Welfare Project Charity Entrepreneurship Sharpen Strategy Operations gurus Andrew Player and Aneeha Patwardhan The Charity Entrepreneurship and EA Ops Slack groups, both sources of endless wisdom and advice Thank you all for helping us make our world a little more compassionate. We’re excited to continue sharing our progress with you.","text",19

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2023-plans","Our 2023 Plans for Work in India Updated:Dec 20, 2022 2022 has been a fairly positive year for Fish Welfare Initiative: Weco-hostedChina’s first-ever Aquatic Animal Welfare Forum, wereformally recognizedby the Andhra Pradesh state government, andimproved the livesof an estimated additional 530,000 fish. TheAlliance For Responsible Aquaculture(ARA), our farmer program in India, has particularly grown—adding an additional 44 fish farms this year to a current total of 79. We’ll publish more about these achievements (and also where we fell short) in a post in the coming weeks. In this post, we highlight our plans for our work in India in 2023 (see alsoour plansfor our work in China). These plans are primarily informed by two key focuses: First, we are committed to gaining greater confidence in our impact such thatin 2023 we will continue testing and validating. This is particularly the case in the first half of the year, when we will spend significant time testing and refining our soon-to-be-published Version 2 Welfare Standard. This will primarily happen via on-the-ground testing with farmers aimed to assess to what extent Version 2’s impact is an improvement onVersion 1’s. And second, as we (hopefully!) gain greater confidence in the impact of our programming,in 2023 we will scale. Provided that the first half of the year proceeds according to expectation, we plan to transition our currently enrolled farmers over to our Version 2 Standard, as well as enroll 150 additional farms with it (in other words, transition fromexplore to exploit mode). This planned enrollment will more than double the size of the ARA. We will continue our corporate and policy work in India as well, both in order to support our farmer work as well as to obtain additional promising outcomes.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2023-plans","Program Plans In Detail Broken down by program area, our plans for 2023 are the following: Helping Fish: We aim to improve the lives of an additional 1,500,000 fish, primarily through theAlliance For Responsible Aquaculture(ARA). We estimate that this will require us to onboard 150 new farms to the ARA. Improving our Welfare Standard: We plan to test our Version 2 Standard in the field, and we aim to modify and improve it such that next year we become at least 75% confident that it meets our threshold for both implementability and impact. We also aim to publish our Version 3 Standard, which will take our updated Version 2 Standard and add new components to it, by the end of the year. Corporate: Despite somepositivemomentum, our corporate work has proven challenging in 2022—specifically, we do not expect to complete the trial run of higher welfare fish being procured that we intended to achieve. Although our 2023 corporate strategy is still tentative, we currently plan to try again, this time with much more knowledge and some internal changes under our belts, to complete several corporate trial runs. Our plan is for these to later lead to corporate commitments, of which we aim to attain 2 next year. Policy: Our main policy work in 2023 will involve working with state governments to provide technical assistance on ordinances mandating improved water quality for farmed fish—specifically, we aim to support 2 state governments in this way. For more information, see our2023 Objectives and Key Results, which will remain updated with our progress throughout the year. As always, we welcome feedback, criticism, and suggestions about our plans. Feel free to comment those below, orsend in a message. Recent Posts","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/why-we-re-ending-our-pilot-study-early","Main Lessons Learned Leaders of ground projects need to be extremely focused on digging into the details of the project and making sure that everyone is operating with the required knowledge and a shared vision. For large projects, make sure the project leads give appropriate time to project evaluation and strategy, rather than getting caught up in low-level tasks. Put in place regular re-evaluation points, especially for dynamic projects Even in the face of closing deadlines, it is worth investing time into ensuring strong team communication, especially where there are existing barriers (such as asymmetrical expertise). For projects aimed at informing stakeholders, make sure that the project is necessary for those stakeholders to want to collaborate with your organization. In India, building trust with farmers is a necessary part of collecting accurate data and making them engage in welfare improvements for fish. Our Past Approach: Pilot Study Between January and May 2021, Fish Welfare Initiative’s main project was a study into improving fish welfare in Andhra Pradesh, India. The study was a scientifically rigorous test into the effect that training farmers in higher welfare practices had on the welfare of their fish, their profits, and the environmental sustainability of their farm. We planned to work with 9 farms to take in-depth measurements across a production cycle. Our aims were to: Build relationships & showcase the value of fish welfare to our stakeholders: Farmers Governments Markets Gain specific in-depth knowledge on the effects and cost-effectiveness of some of the components of our expansion (e.g. aerators) Gain scientific data on how normal farm operations affect fish In May 2021 we decided to terminate the project early, instead shifting our focus to implementing theAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture(as well as conducting a process evaluation of the Alliance).","text",4
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/why-we-re-ending-our-pilot-study-early","We decided to cancel the project primarily because: The impracticalities of running a very rigorous scientific test on the ground were jeopardizing our ability to capture the values we were aiming for","text",5
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/why-we-re-ending-our-pilot-study-early","We updated our beliefs on how valuable the aims of the pilot study were and found that the study was not needed for helping fish Below, we describe some of the main mistakes that we made during the project and that we expect others could make in similar projects. Main Mistakes Trying to uphold unrealistically high standards Fish farms in Andhra Pradesh are complex. Each region has its own set of challenges and each community has their own way of dealing with those challenges. Despite this, early on we decided to push for the study to be as scientific as possible. We understood that there would be many areas where we would need to concede standardization. However, we felt that striving for as much rigour as possible would lead to the strongest results. What we didn’t properly anticipate was how this would affect our workload. Trying to conform to a high scientific standard drastically increased the logistical effort required for an already operationally challenging project. Our high standards meant that our plans were consistently being proven impractical and requiring being rewritten. For example, we found that one group of farmers did not purchase fry (young fish of a standard size) because they had issues with predatory birds who would eat the smaller fish. As such, they stocked their ponds with yearlings (older fish not of a standard size). This change meant that all the growth rate indicators we planned to measure were going to be considerably less reliable. Unwilling to concede this, we tried to find ways around the problem, such as weighing the fish before being stocked. These changes presented their own logistical challenges, and so on. Too little time spent critically evaluating the project Running an intricate project in the field necessarily comes with a heavy workload, and it is inevitable that at least some elements of the plan will require adjusting over time.","text",6
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/why-we-re-ending-our-pilot-study-early","However, our emphasis on scientific rigour and standardized conditions, on top of our inexperience with field projects, exacerbated these issues, such that the project team spent a lot of time ‘fire fighting’ to try and retain our ambitions for the project. We were also ambitious in the number of supplementary materials we wanted to produce (such as the6 farmer guideswe created).","text",7
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/why-we-re-ending-our-pilot-study-early","These time costs led to the project leaders needing to spend all their time helping to execute the project, and thus very little time was left for evaluating the project. This lack of reflection exacerbated the other issues with the project, allowing them to go unchecked, and also meant that we took longer to terminate the project than we perhaps could have otherwise. Regular pre-set re-evaluation points perhaps could have resolved this, but we neglected to set these up until later in the project. Miscommunication with our ground staff Communicating across cultural boundaries can be difficult, even in person. However, the coronavirus pandemic meant that multiple members of our team were not able to be in-country. There were many instances where miscommunication wasted time and caused confusion during the project. For example, aerators require triphase electricity in order to operate. As such, the project leaders set triphase electricity as a requirement for the farms within the project. What the project leaders neglected to mention was that triphase electricity was required to be available in both the mornings and afternoons (as this is when ponds need to be aerated). The farms that the ground staff managed to find only had access to triphase electricity early in the morning. Because the project leaders did not mention the time stipulation, these farms seemed to fit all the requirements, and so were accepted into the study. This, in turn, meant that aerators, one of the main elements we wanted to test, could not be properly assessed on these farms without expensive workarounds such as a generator. It took us weeks to realize this error. This stands both as an example of the level of detail and complexity that is present in working with farmers in India, and how even small details missed can have an outsized impact on the project.","text",8
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/why-we-re-ending-our-pilot-study-early","Assuming what our Indian stakeholders wanted We decided to run a rigorous scientific study primarily to showcase the value of higher welfare farming practices to NGOs, farmers, and government officials in what we felt was the most honest and believable manner (peer-reviewed journals). We believed that a peer-reviewed study was valuable because we had seen positive signs from NGOs, farmers, and government officials that this was indeed a project they were interested in. What we did not realize, however, was that this was not something they saw as a requirement for working with us. It took us a long time to realize that these stakeholders were already happy to act on implementing higher welfare without the study.","text",9
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/why-we-re-ending-our-pilot-study-early","Undervaluing building relationships with farmers In India, building trust with farmers is a necessary part of making improvements for their fish. Without trust, farmers will not be comfortable sharing details about their farm operation, won’t believe in the importance of fish welfare, and are liable to view an RCT study design with scepticism and as unfair to the control farms. Because we wanted to collect data quickly, our project leaders couldn’t give our ground staff enough time to build these relationships of trust before trying to build our plans for the study. This led to us having inaccurate data from farmers who were hesitant to disclose information, and to farmers not engaging in the study as we had hoped. Our Current Approach: Expansion of the Alliance for Responsible Aquaculture and Process Evaluation Our main focus in India is now theAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture, where we and ourlocal partner NGOswork with farmers to set stocking densities and water quality levels that increase welfare for fish. Unlike the pilot study, our alliance work is primarily focused on helping fish, rather than on generating scientific results and showcasing a model. As a consequence, although we do still take measurements, they are much less intensive and we are less concerned about standardising conditions. Also, the scope of this project is much broader than the pilot study. Currently,31 farmers have joined the alliance, affecting roughly 380,000 fish per production cycle. We expect to have more farmers join soon. We still believe that there is a need for Fish Welfare Initiative to deeply evaluate our impact on fish welfare, and some information will be taken from our partnered farms to help us review this. However, the focus of our evaluation is now on aprocess evaluation, which evaluates whether a program is being successfully implemented at the operational level (a change that was recommended by our advisors) [1].","text",10
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/why-we-re-ending-our-pilot-study-early","We believe this is the right approach because our uncertainties lie more in the implementation of our program, rather than in the impact of our welfare improvements.","text",11
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/why-we-re-ending-our-pilot-study-early","Overall Thoughts Although the pilot study had many issues, we are generally happy with the position it has left us in. Much of the time spent (such as on finding farmers and building relationships with them) has been valuable in establishing theAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture. Most of the farmers who were in the study have now joined the alliance. Running a local study was also extremely useful in engaging our key stakeholders early on (such as NGOs and government officials). The primary reason we terminated the study was that we found that those stakeholders were more eager to start making fish welfare improvements than we had expected, and so we felt it was time to focus on direct work for fish [2]. We hope that some of these lessons can be valuable for groups considering intricate projects in the field. If you would like to talk more about our experience with the study and lessons learned, please feel free to contact tom@fwi.fish Endnotes To read more about process evaluations, seeIDinsight’s summary. Stakeholders also became more eager to start implementation because we successfully simplified our intervention and messaging such that they could better see the value of our project without the need for a study.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/portugal-farm-improvements","This post outlines what we believe to be the main welfare improvements required in this farming system to enhance the safeguarding of fish welfare in their semi-intensive ponds. This work is intended to pilot what Fish Welfare Initiative sees for its possible future concerning aquaculture business consultation for better fish welfare. Though ambitious, we believe farm consultations hit close to the best possibility of a significant positive effect on fish welfare. This will not only help fish but also, to some extent, lower the environmental footprint of aquaculture and increase people's well-being in tandem. “Small in size, but big in potential.” People in Portugal repeat this phrase about their football players, referring to the high number of Portuguese born and raised athletes that rule the strongest teams across the globe.But this is only half-true concerning aquaculture, especially in any coastal country with a long fishing tradition, as is the case in Portugal. It is true that fisheries currently represents great economic importance to the country, while aquaculture remains only a secondary animal protein production activity.As such, fisheries’ environmental footprint is still a major obstacle to sustainability and the responsible use of natural resources.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/portugal-farm-improvements","As one of the leading fish consumers per capita, ranking 3rd in the world, it may be expected that Portugal would have already developed aquaculture practices that compete with larger aquaculture producers, match the market demand, and complement capture fisheries (Figure 1). However, despite aquaculture’s status in Portugal as “a player” still in its childhood, the industry's track record is already well-understood. Portugal, then, can make use of their own and others’ previous failures and lessons to aim for sustainable and responsible aquaculture, ultimately harming fewer fish. Portugal's baby steps for Aquaculture This industry has operated in transitional waters (estuaries and coastal lagoons), rich in nutrients, along with coastal areas. This means high availability of oxygen and natural feed, generating conditions that enable the farming of fish. Aquaculture has experienced a slow development over the years, with semi-intensive and extensive systems becoming the most common systems used for fish production. Nevertheless, it is a sector that still rises in economic importance every year, and will continue to quickly expand in the following years -- with EPPO playing a key role in this development. Portuguese Aquaculture Experimental Station (EPPO) EPPO is a noteworthy producer in Portuguese aquaculture, having a unique intensive/semi-intensive infrastructure placed in an estuary in the south of the country. The station has sought out connections with the different actors involved in the development of aquaculture, namely, public entities and the productive sector (source:IPMA). It is designed to carry out research, development, and experimental demonstration at a pilot-scale (to eventually upscale to private companies).","text",6
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/portugal-farm-improvements","Their core goals are to: Enhance aquaculture farming practices, Develop new commercial species, Promote the transfer of technology to the productive private sector and other actors, and Be an essential pillar in scientific and technical training, both at the professional and university level.","text",7
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/portugal-farm-improvements","They also provide farmers with seeds, knowledge, and technical assistance. As a public institute in Portugal, most of the fishes they raise are donated to non-profit institutions, and the remaining are given to other research institutions and private companies as potential broodstock. EPPO’s potential welfare issues Fishes’ development, and their consequent welfare, depends on the farming conditions to which the fish are subjected during their life cycle. Despite some room for improvement, the initial life stages were found to be close to optimal regarding the welfare that can be attained under culture conditions. Fish Welfare Initiative decided to thus focus on the farmed species’ later stage of development. We chose this stage becausesemi-intensive production systems exercise reasonably poor control over environmental factors, namely, feed intake, water quality, predators, and biosecurity, and additionally, they require more difficult handling practices. Estuaries are areas subjected to various human pressures, with high pollutant input from many different sources. Thus, these fishes’ long-term exposure may pose health risks and decrease growth performance. And when in polyculture, the population species’ composition may affect fish development and overall welfare. We found that a polyculture with meagre, seabream, seabass, grouper, and white seabream, species that have different trophic levels and welfare-related issues, is expected. Harvest practices (capture, handling, and slaughter) also often pose serious welfare issues. “Blue card” for fair environmental play EPPO is a clear example of good practices regarding infrastructures, technology, and routines. Just to mention a few: Water entry is first subjected to sand filters, so biological/physical contamination is unlikely to occur. Water outflow passes through a reservoir tank, where potential chemicals and algae blooms are hindered. Overall, water quality was within the species’ optimal ranges.","text",8
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/portugal-farm-improvements","Fish are inspected for diseases and growth performance with some frequency: at least once every three days in summer, or whenever the farmers suspect a health issue. Since 2014, fish diseases have decreased by 60%.","text",9
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/portugal-farm-improvements","Feed is high quality. This is because of EPPO’s strong collaboration with feed companies that tailor feeds to their farmed species, life stages, and farming systems. Feed conversion ratios (FCRs) for almost all species in the pond were below 2. The farming ponds are covered with a simple, but well thought out, net cover, mitigating welfare concerns for the fish and for predators. EPPO rotates pond use, allowing for best practice pond preparation and a lower negative impact on fish welfare. Pond sediments are always dried after each production cycle, and when necessary, lime is applied to increase pH and reduce anoxic areas. No red cards, but still a few yellow cards for fish welfare The main issues identified by FWIwere debatedwith the farmersto better understand a practical route for improvement. FWI researchers started by providingtraining in Aquaculture Best Practices and the main welfare-related issuesaffecting their farming system. Overall, feedback was positive, and despite many things being “old news” to EPPO, some minor aspects were not entirely clear to them. One good example was the different trophic levels of the polycultured species, and how much they may impact the animals' welfare, or to what extent they could be used to prevent welfare issues. Additionally, they were not aware of the best slaughter practices for their species. The apparent mistake made was using an electrical stunner without any previous research and knowledge, and expecting to kill fish with the electrical shocks rather than stunning them and then killing them by bleeding or ice. Overall, the broad categories of welfare improvements that FWI helped implement were: 1. 	Healthy stocking densities in polyculture a. Ensure healthy stocking densities: stocking densities were misfitted for the farming system’s overall conditions and carrying capacity.","text",10
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/portugal-farm-improvements","Departing from 4kgs per cubic meter (varying weight and size, depending on the species),the researchers/farmers committed to not exceed 2.5kg/m3, with the typical final density at 1.5kg/m3. Species composition was debated, and the species involved in the polyculture will be better selected according to their trophic level and behavior, e.g., seabream and seabass; or meagre, white seabream, and grouper. If meagre is polycultured with seabream, for example, the respective proportion should be at least 7:1, and the meagre should be settled in the pond first. Additionally, partial harvest will be performed each time one species becomes too dominant (if they are already commercial size) and begins affecting the others’ foraging behavior.","text",11
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/portugal-farm-improvements","2. 	Best harvest practices (handling, capture, and slaughtering) a. The farmers practice partial harvesting. Since clients very often prefer just one or two species, handling days affect all the fish while removing just a few. After observing the fishes’ behavior on a prior harvest day, the farmers were advised to focus on different points of the harvest net according to the target species’ typical escape behavior. For example, seabream swim more on the bottom alongside white seabream on the lateral side of the net seine, while seabass and meagre are found closer to the surface of the net funnel. Grouper spreads across the entire water surface. When the species were specifically targeted like this, handling and overcrowding time was reduced, and fish suffered fewer injuries. They were also, most likely, less prone to diseases given the lower stress levels. No mortality was found in the next few days, as opposed to what usually occurs.","text",12

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/portugal-farm-improvements","b. Harvest procedures were preceded by a 48h starvation period, rather than their common practice of 24h, given that the fish were being harvested for killing and not for sampling. Due to this longer duration, stress levels from the slaughter method were reduced, and the fish became stunned faster. c. Harvest procedures started in the early hours of the morning, so that they occurred 					   close to or within the optimal temperature range of the species. d. During handling, minimize density as much as possible by involving fewer fishes in the procedure, avoiding seine net overload, and crowding the fish in steps instead of all at once. When done correctly, the fishes’ maximal stress responses are avoided. ""Drying up” time should also be made as short as possible, reducing exhaustion, asphyxiation, injuries, and deaths. The rule of thumb when taking fish from the harvest net to the slaughter container is “minimize the time fish are outside water.”","text",14
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/portugal-farm-improvements","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3c20d0_829dd1b5f50a4253b659b6baa5a88ca6~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_51,h_27,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_auto/3c20d0_829dd1b5f50a4253b659b6baa5a88ca6~mv2.png","image",15
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/portugal-farm-improvements","e. In the absence of better conditions, ⅓ of ice slurry to ⅔ of water was recommended to stun/kill fish faster. Electrical stunning was not adapted for the different species, and their stunning parameters were not known, so using it may have caused more harm than good. Implications for our work Many of these improvements are relatively easy for producers to apply, and may constitute a major boost to fish welfare. The recommended welfare improvements helped around 4,500 individuals just in one pond. Considering that EPPO has 10 ponds of the same size, usually with the same stocking densities, transferring these practices to future harvests across all the different pondswill impact ~45,000 fish per farming cycle. Like with aquaculture in Portugal, even baby steps towards better fish lives are headed in the right direction to spare millions of fish from suffering. The future increasingly looks to finding solutions adapted to the environment, animals, and the demand and needs of the market: transversal sustainability. Offshore farming in Portugal is in development, and for the present, there are nearly 100 cages in use -- but this number is trending upwards. To feed this growth, hatcheries will need to provide juvenile fish. Given EPPO’s standout role in the national aquaculture licencing and knowledge transfer, Fish Welfare Initiative couldn’t have imagined a better opportunity to start working with a farm in Portugal and increase awareness for a critical factor for these new businesses: the fishes’ welfare. Impacting and improving welfare standards in their facilities may well be the best approach to increasing welfare improvements’ cost-effectiveness, and more quickly impact the way their partners, private farmers, will farm their fish in the future.Linking with Governmental Institutes like EPPO, or FPOs with recognized roles in the country's industry, seems to be aneffective way forward to improve the lives of fish.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/takeaways-from-fwi-s-hiring-process","Takeaways from FWI's Hiring Process Updated:Jun 9, 2020 This blog post is a selection of a post we wrote on the Effective Altruism Forum. Seefull post here. Who should read this: This post will likely only be useful to those employers who will be directly involved in a hiring process, although the Recommendations for Applicants section should be useful for most job applicants. Job applicants may also find it interesting to learn about the employer side of the process. We recently completed our hiring process for our first new full-time employees: a Research Analyst and an Animal Welfare Specialist. As neither of us had previous hiring experience, we set out to build a process based on the best available evidence on how to hire effectively, objectively, and kindly. The following is what we found and learned. We hope that this process and thelinked templateswill be useful to your organization and will save you some of the large time investment required to create a new process. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to comment below orcontact us. Big Takeaways Probably the best hiring advice we received came from the CEO of a GiveWell-recommended charity. He looks for candidates who are “smart, nice, and really want the job.” Your hiring process is a reflection of your organization. To reflect FWI, we aimed to make our hiring process evidence-based, compassionate, unconventional/innovative, and requiring some dedication. If you’re not already, you should useCalendlyor another scheduling software to schedule all interviews. We found EA Facebook pages, our website, and personal recommendations to be the best places to find talented applicants. Score everything with a template, where applicant materials and questions are all scored quantitatively. This will help you increase objectivity. You should input these scores for each round into one master spreadsheet. With interviews, we updated away from asking the same somewhat shallow questions.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/takeaways-from-fwi-s-hiring-process","Rather, asking fewer and more probing semi-structured questions provided more valuable information.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/takeaways-from-fwi-s-hiring-process","Don’t be afraid to gather more information about a candidate: additional calls, emails, and interviews can all be helpful. Don’t be a jerk to your applicants. Too many employers are. Your applicants will appreciate you for how you treat them and leave with a good impression of your organization. Recent Posts","text",4

Fish Welfare Initiative has grown immensely over the past 3 years: From our humble beginnings of 2 people in a small London office, we now have a team of 19 full-time equivalent, and operations in India, China, and the Philippines. As we grow from a small startup where everyone is friends, to a mid-sized organization where everyone may not even know each other, we believe more of an effort must be made to ensure a culture that aligns with our values—specifically, that we foster a culture that is intensely results-oriented, honest, collaborative, and kind. To this end, we conduct regular anonymous internal culture surveys. And as part of our commitment to transparency, we’re publishing the highlights from our most recent survey below. We intend to continue doing this, regardless of the survey results. The raw data from the survey may be accessedhere. General Satisfaction Staff were asked “How satisfied are you overall working at FWI?”, with the following scoring: A score of 1 represents “Extremely unsatisfied—will likely leave soon” A score of 10 represents “Extremely satisfied—FWI is by far the best organization I can imagine working at” Responses were anonymous.

In a project like ours where much more progress is driven by good ideas than by sheer brute force, sacrificing quality for quantity of work is short-sighted. It’s bad for our team: We, of course, care deeply about all of our team members and want them to be well-rested and fulfilled while at their job. Given the nature of the issues we address, and given the intense drive that most of our team feels to do so, FWI is by its nature a fairly intense organization, and we believe that we expect more out of people than most. As we tell people in the interviewing process, for most roles FWI is generally not the place to work if you want a straightforward, always-ends-at-5:00 type of job. A balance here must be struck. We are making the following efforts to strike it: When we set quarterly goals for next quarter, we are reminding the goal-setters to have realistic expectations about what people can achieve in 1 quarter. Our leadership team, particularly those who remote work from Europe or the US, have been reminded to be mindful about scheduling evening meetings with our India team.","text",8

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/june-survey","At the moment, FWI generally pays above market for our staff in India and the Philippines, and below market for our staff from Europe and the US (in large part because such staff members are early-career effective altruism type people). So far this has worked reasonably well, though not perfectly, and we do not feel like it has detrimentally impacted talent recruitment in the West. Admittedly, the majority of our current and upcoming hires are Indian so it hasn’t proven to be a major issue. We believe it’s critical to our work to attract and retain the very best people, so we will continue to re-evaluate our pay policy to ensure that it is supporting this outcome.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/satellite-findings","Satellite Imagery Study Findings By Dr. Paul Monaghan, Fish Welfare Initiative Research & Development Lead Summary We previously conducted aproof-of-concept studyto assess whether data predicted from satellite imagery could enable us to detect water quality issues remotely. The results of that study are now in: We found a strong correlation between the satellite-predicted and the empirical data, suggesting that satellite imagery could be a key part of increasing the scalability and cost effectiveness of our farm program moving forwards. This is a blogpost discussing the study’s findings. The report of the study may be viewedhere. FWI isinvestingmore in R&D this year. We will be running several studies throughout the course of the year in order to inform improvements to our programming, and will keep our blog updated with our progress. Background Fish Welfare Initiative’s core program, theAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture(ARA), focuses on improving water quality in fish farms. Our ground teams collect water quality data and provide farmers with corrective actions when needed. Currently, the ARA supports 135 fish farms in the Kolleru and Nellore regions of Andhra Pradesh. In the current model, FWI data collectors visit each fish farm approximately once a month. This approach limits our scalability, as increasing the number of farms requires more data collectors. Additionally, the once-a-month visits mean that water quality issues between visits may go unnoticed, potentially exposing fish to poor conditions. To address these challenges, we explored the possibility of using satellite imagery to remotely monitor water quality. If successful, this method could allow us to collect data more frequently without additional human resources, making the ARA more scalable and impactful. Driven by our commitment to evidence-based programming, we initiated astudyin February to test this approach.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/satellite-findings","We are excited to share the key findings from this study. The Study To determine whether satellite imagery could accurately and reliably inform water quality decisions, FWI collaborated withCaptain Fresh, an Indian seafood company experienced in using satellite imagery in the aquaculture industry. We conducted a proof-of-concept study involving 20 fish farms, all part of the ARA in the Kolleru region of Andhra Pradesh. The study focused on six key water quality parameters: ammonia, dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), phycocyanin (PC), pH, and temperature. Data for these parameters were collected both empirically (through direct measurements) and remotely (via satellite imagery analysis provided by Captain Fresh). Data collection occurred every five days, aligning with the Sentinel-2 satellite's flyover schedule, resulting in five rounds of data collection for each farm. For each parameter, the collected data were divided randomly into two groups. One group was used to train a predictive model, while the other was used to validate the model. We assessed the models using four statistical measurements: correlation coefficient (r), coefficient of determination (R²), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Ideal models have r values close to ±1, R² values close to 1, and low RMSE and MAPE values.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/satellite-findings","Our Findings For four of the six water quality parameters—ammonia, DO, Chl-a, and PC—predicted and empirical data were sufficiently correlated to suggest that remote monitoring has utility.Most encouragingly, the predicted and empirical data for both PC and Chl-a showed high correlations, with r values of 0.99 and 0.96, respectively, and R² values of 0.98 and 0.92, respectively. The data for DO and ammonia were also strongly correlated, with r values of 0.90 and 0.92, and R² values of 0.81 and 0.85, respectively. These results indicate that remote monitoring of these parameters is feasible. For two of the six water quality parameters—pH and temperature—there was no correlation between predicted and empirical data.The r values for these parameters were 0.22 and 0.41, and the R² values were 0.05 and 0.17, indicating significant deviation of predicted values from actual values. This suggests that remote monitoring of pH and temperature using these models is not currently viable. The four water quality parameters with high r and R² values—ammonia, DO, Chl-a, and PC—also had low RMSE and MAPE values. This implies that the models' predictions were close to the actual values, supporting the potential utility of remote monitoring for these parameters. In contrast, the high RMSE and MAPE values for pH and temperature further indicate that the models for these parameters are not accurate. Overall, the findings from this proof-of-concept study are highly encouraging, indicating real potential to utilize remote monitoring for ammonia, DO, Chl-a, and/or PC via analysis of satellite imagery as part of FWI’s flagship ARA program.","text",6

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/satellite-findings","Next Steps We believe that this concept will have utility for the ARA, but it’s a little too early to roll it out in the ARA just yet.Before incorporating remote monitoring of fish farms into the ARA, additional work is needed to improve the models for predicting these water quality parameters to ensure accuracy and reliability. Specifically, the models need further training with larger data sets and data collected over a longer period to avoid any bias from the short study window (three weeks). Additionally, we need to understand how weather, particularly cloud cover, may impact the accuracy of satellite-predicted water quality values. Cloud cover is a known limitation of using satellite imagery for remote data collection, and it did impact data collection during this study. Regardless of model accuracy, understanding the significance of this limitation is crucial before making major changes to the ARA program. Although not quite ready for programmatic purposes just yet, the findings from our proof-of-concept study allow us to move forward with greater confidence, guided by evidence. We’re excited by the potential of incorporating this technology into our programming to help us scale our work and improve the welfare of many more fishes. We are now discussing internally how we plan to proceed with this intervention. As these plans develop, we will keep our blog updated with our progress. Want to read the full study report? Seehere.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/satellites","First R&D Study of 2024: Validating Satellite Imagery to Detect Poor Water Quality Updated:Feb 20 By Dr. Paul Monaghan, Fish Welfare Initiative Research & Development Lead Summary:In order to increase the cost effectiveness of our farmer program (theARA), we are considering using satellite imagery to detect water quality issues remotely, which would lessen our current reliance on visiting farms individually. This post discusses a study that we began this week, and will run with 20 partner farms for the next five weeks, to validate whether this technology will indeed work for our purposes. FWI isinvestingin more and more rigorous R&D this year than previously. We will be running several studies throughout the course of the year in order to identify improved welfare improvements, and will keep our blog updated with our progress. This post is the first of these planned studies—stay tuned for more! Introduction We made an importantdecisionin 2023 to establish a new department: the Research & Development (R&D) Department.The stated objective of our R&D Department is todevelop new theories of change and to conduct studies to inform FWI programs to improve the lives of fishes.In designing studies to inform new or improved programs, the R&D Department considers the potential for scale from the outset, along with perceived level of impact. This post describes one such study that the R&D Department has just begun. Background Fish Welfare Initiative’s (FWI) current core program is theAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture(ARA). This program centers on our ground teams collecting water quality data from fish farms and providing the farmers with corrective actions in the event of key water quality parameters indicating that fishes may be exposed to poor conditions. ARA farms also commit to a density cap of 3000 fishes per acre. The ARA currently supports approximately 100 farms primarily in the Kolleru and Nellore regions of Andhra Pradesh, India.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/satellites","The current ARA model requires FWI data collectors to physically visit farms, with the current strategy being to conduct visits once a month to each farm.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/satellites","We are currently exploring ways to increase the cost-effectiveness, scalability, and impact of the ARA program: The ARA team is currently exploring potential mechanisms of boosting the number of visits made to farms with the worst water quality issues (see our recentpost from Januaryin which we shared a report of a study we conducted at some of the farms with the worst record of water quality). Simultaneously, the R&D Department is exploring if using satellite imagery to remotely monitor water quality is a viable option, allowing the ARA to collect water quality data more regularly while simultaneously limiting the requirement to actually visit farms. The latter of these—using satellite imagery to detect water quality issues—is the focus of our new study. Hypothesis If our study reveals that key water quality data collected through analysis of satellite imagery are sufficiently accurate and reliable, the ARA model could be modified to exploit remote data collection, allowing for more frequent collection of water quality data at all farms without the need for additional human resources.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/satellites","Research Question Is data collected via analysis of satellite imagery sufficiently accurate and reliable to inform the ARA’s decision-making regarding fish farms that require support to improve water quality and corrective actions to recommend to farmers? Justification for Study If we can show that using satellite imagery is a viable method to detect farms with high levels of phytoplankton—and/or any other key water quality parameter that can be detected using satellite imagery—we could: Scale up the ARA to support more fish farms with less reliance on “on site” water quality monitoring by data collectors. Collect data from each farm more frequently than currently practiced as part of the ARA. Allow us to offer more targeted support to ARA farmers most at-risk (i.e. those farms that exhibit consistent water quality problems). Improve our approach for identifying future partner farms, for instance by prioritizing regions or farms with known and consistent water quality issues. If this approach is shown to be valid, it could improve the ARA’s scalability, cost-effectiveness, and impact, helping us to prioritize our resources for farms where water quality issues exist, and thereby improve the lives of fishes most in need. Study Plans Yesterday, on February 19, the R&D Department initiated a study to provide evidence as to whether water quality parameters determined through analysis of satellite imagery are sufficiently accurate and reliable to inform decisions on the ground. The results of this study will be used to inform future strategies for possibly scaling the ARA.","text",6

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/satellites","FWI has no prior experience using satellite imagery, and to test this approach we are partnering with a private partner in India to leverage their experience with satellite imagery. This study will compare water quality data obtained from analysis of satellite images (provided by our partner) with empirical water quality data obtained by direct measurements at the same farms (provided by FWI). This week we have begun collecting water quality data—via both analysis of satellite imagery and direct measurements—at 20 fish farms supported by the ARA. This will continue over the next five weeks. Afterwards, the data sets will be compared to understand if the water quality parameters determined via analysis of satellite imagery are sufficiently accurate and reliable. If the results are positive, we’ll determine how we can incorporate this technology into our programming, and what FWI needs to do; for example, we’ll likely need to build-up in-house capacity to collect and analyze satellite images. But first, in keeping with our commitment to evidence-based decision making, we’re waiting for the results of this study before deciding on how we can leverage it. We’re excited to commence this study, and we look forward to sharing the results later in the year. Recent Posts","text",8

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/assessing-v1","Assessing Version 1 of our Standard Updated:Feb 21 What is FWI’s current standard? Version 1 of our welfare standardin India contains two core components: a stocking density ask and a water quality ask. As of this writing,54 fish farms and 1 corporationhave voluntarily committed to these standards. Stocking density When farmers sign up for theAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture(ARA), they agree to a stocking density cap of 3000 fish per acre. [1] Lowering stocking densities often is important for farmed fish, both directly because it reduces ammonia production, disease rates, and biological oxygen demand, and indirectly because it prevents farmers from using our water quality improvements as motivation to increase the number of fish in the system, thereby sacrificing any welfare gains that have been achieved. 3000 fish per acre has, in the relatively sparse literature assessing Indian Major Carp, been shown to be beneficial for promoting fish health. [2] However, we plan to further test the correct balance between improved conditions for fish and economic viability from the farmer’s side. We also have stocking caps for other types of systems: Fish-Shrimp polyculture: 3000 fish/acre and 80,000 shrimp/acre Juvenile fish: 50,000 fish/acre We are currently considering a new stocking density for larger ponds (>20 acres) Water Quality Every 15 days, an FWI representative visits a farmer’s pond and takes water quality measurements. The core measurements are: Dissolved oxygen pH Ammonia Turbidity Primary productivity Temperature","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/assessing-v1","Nikhil, one of our datacollectors, using a water quality monitoring device at a fish farm in Andhra Pradesh, India. FWI has createdrequired and optimal rangesfor each of these parameters. When we find that one of these parameters is outside of the required range, we tell the farmer corrective actions that we believe will resolve the problem (see ourcorrective actions). To remain in the ARA (and to thus gain benefits like regular water quality monitoring) farmers must consistently make a good faith effort to implement the corrective actions. Typical corrective actions include turning on aerators, increasing water exchange, reducing feed quantity, and liming the pond. What impact has our standard had? Over 2021, Version 1 of our welfare standard potentially helped about 350,000 fish (our goal for the year was 300,000). This was around 40% of the total fish on ARA farms. We did not help fish on every ARA farm either because certain farms were already performing well (no corrective actions or stocking decrease needed) or because our corrective actions failed to improve conditions on certain farms. We believed our standard potentially helped a further ~1 million shrimp, although we are highly uncertain about this number and don’t think much weight should be put in it. For more information, seeOur Impact. These are promising results, however, we believe that it is important to assess both how many animals were affected, as well as to what degree we expect those animals to be living better lives. Considering our stocking density cap, there is some evidence this has not had significant positive effects on fish welfare. Conducting a Pearson correlation coefficient on the relationship between stocking density and dissolved oxygen (the main parameter that excessive stocking densities jeopardize, and a closer proxy for welfare) showed no significant correlation (roughly -0.1).","text",4
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/assessing-v1","[3] This would make sense, as 3000 fish/acre does not represent too large of a decrease in the total individuals from what farmers were already stocking (on average farmers show a ~325 fish per acre reduction, or about 10%, in their intended stocking before and after joining the ARA). We are currently assessing the viability of lower stocking densities (seeWhat are the next stepsbelow).","text",5
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/assessing-v1","Note that this is not considering longer-term implications of keeping stocking densities at suitable limits, such as preventing more intensified production practices that damage fish welfare and the environment. Considering water quality corrective actions, there seems to be good evidence that FWI has had positive effects on fish lives. Roughly 60% of our corrective actions are followed by an improvement in the parameter that was outside of the required range. Some of this will happen naturally through a regression to the mean. However, given our field staffs' extension interaction with and understanding of these farms, we feel intuitively confident that a significant portion of these improvements had causal links to FWI (and fish marked as potentially helped by FWI are only those that we feel ≥80% confident we are causally responsible for improvements in their pond). However, corrective actions have appeared to only have short-term implications for water quality parameters. Across the entirety of our measurements, we have not seen a significant improvement in water quality being within the range that we would expect from our improvements. As such, we believe our standard currently reduces extreme suffering events (such as critically low oxygen events), but does not give long-term relief from the chronic welfare issues fish farming creates (such as consistently harmful oxygen levels). As such, we believe that pivoting to a standard that focuses on preventative measures may be able to increase our overall impact across the entirety of fishes’ lives. What are the next steps? Currently, FWI is continuing to implement Version 1 of our standard under the belief that this is bringing better lives to fish, both through direct water quality improvements and indirect benefits such as preventing future stocking density increases. We will continue to add more farmers to the ARA in order to proliferate Version 1 as well as fish welfare concepts more broadly.","text",6
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/assessing-v1","Whilst this is happening, however, several of our team are working to define Version 2 of our standard that we hope can bring more long-term benefits to fish. We are currently finalizing the plans for a test of a new standard in Eluru, one of the regions in which FWI works in India, which will focus on further reductions in stocking density as well as trialing different methods for controlling phytoplankton populations (a key aspect of controlling dissolved oxygen in earthen pond systems). To learn more about our plan for 2022, see our2022 scale up plan.","text",7
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/assessing-v1","Footnotes 1 -We used fish per acre even though we believe fish per cubic meter is more accurate to the experience of the fish. This is because acre is the most common denominator used in India, and almost all farmers use uneven earthen ponds that they do not know a volume for. 2 -Feeding and feed management of Indian major carps in Andhra Pradesh, India.3 -However, the Pearson correlation coefficient is a bivariate analysis that cannot take into account more complex relationships between multiple variables. As such, deeper assessment would be needed to draw strong conclusions (a rudimentary principal component analysis showed a larger negative correlation). Recent Posts","text",8

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/feed-fortification","Second R&D Study of 2024: Feed Fortification By Dr. Paul Monaghan, Fish Welfare Initiative Research & Development Lead Summary Feed quality and management are critical determinants of fish welfare. The feed type most commonly used by farmers of Indian major carp in Andhra Pradesh is well recognized to be an unsuitable feed for fishes, and thus we believe causes significant suffering, though it remains widespread due to its low cost. This post discusses a study that we began today (June 29), and which will run for the next four months at our new test facility, to assess the welfare and economic implications of the custom-formulated version of the feed that we developed. In order to improve its programming, FWI isinvestingmore in R&D this year. We will be running several studies throughout the course of the year in order to inform improvements to our programming, and will keep our blog updated with our progress. Background Among the myriad welfare issues in aquaculture, feed quality and management are two of the most critical factors affecting fish welfare. Most farmers of Indian major carp (IMC) in Andhra Pradesh usede-oiled rice bran (DORB)as the primary supplemental feed during the grow-out stage. DORB is a by-product of oil extraction from rice bran, which itself is a by-product of rice production. Unfortunately, DORB’s poor nutritional value—lacking essential proteins, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals—makes it unsuitable for fishes. Additionally, DORB contains mycotoxins and other anti-nutritional factors that reduce nutrient absorption and digestibility. FWI believes that the use of DORB likely causes suffering for the fishes and increases their susceptibility to other welfare issues, such as disease. Apart from its poor nutritional value, feed management practices typically employed for DORB-based feeding contribute to poor water quality. Observations made by FWI suggest that many farmers commonly overfeed (i.e.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/feed-fortification","provide more feed than is considered necessary for the fish biomass in the pond), and employ poor practices, such as dumping uneaten feed into the pond. Uneaten DORB can undergo decomposition, consuming oxygen, and can also settle at the bottom of the pond and contribute to excessive organic detritus, causing anaerobic conditions in the sediment. All together, the dynamics of dissolved oxygen (DO) levels in the pond can be greatly impacted by poor DORB-based feed management practices.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/feed-fortification","DORB is the feed type of choice for IMC farmers in Andhra Pradesh due to its low cost. There are other feed options available that have improved nutritional value, but these are not considered cost-effective for IMC farmers, particularly at the grow-out phase of the production cycle where margins are the lowest. FWI is interested in testing if a modified version of DORB, supplemented with a small number of nutrients and formulated as a pellet, is a viable option for IMC grow-out farmers to utilize in place of their current feed.","text",4
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/feed-fortification","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6f025a_58e8cae7c6cd42d28bc73db6310d6d45~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_92,h_69,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_auto/6f025a_58e8cae7c6cd42d28bc73db6310d6d45~mv2.jpg","image",5
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/feed-fortification","Hypothesis If we can produce a nutritionally-superior DORB in pelleted format at a cost attractive to farmers, and show that the additional cost is met—or exceeded—by the increased margins that farmers gain from (i) selling fishes that fetch a higher price (resulting from improved nutrition and from living in an environment with better welfare conditions), and/or (ii) reduced costs due to utilizing less feed, FWI could consider a future program whereby we work with manufacturers to produce the modified formulation of DORB and encourage farmers to use it. Research Question Does a modified formulation of DORB—supplemented with selected nutrients and formulated as a pellet—improve the welfare of fishes through meeting their nutritional requirements and improving their water quality, while resulting in fishes that are at least the same size as those fed on conventional DORB? Study Plans On this post’s date of publication (June 29), FWI initiated a controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a modified DORB formulation. Developed by our Fish Welfare Specialist, Dr. Cerqueira, this nutrient-enhanced DORB was produced at a local feed mill in Andhra Pradesh to be both nutritionally superior and cost-effective. We are conducting this study in our six newly constructed test ponds at Adikavi Nannaya University (AKNU) in Rajamahendravaram, Andhra Pradesh (see photo below). These facilities allow us to test different practices in controlled, farm-like conditions, and this study marks their inaugural use.","text",6

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/feed-fortification","On June 29, we stocked the ponds with Indian major carp (IMC) and divided them into three groups: Negative control: A group fed conventional DORB feed. Positive control: A group fed commercially-available pelleted feed (believed to be best for welfare, but beyond the price range of most farmers). Experimental group: A group fed our modified DORB. This comparative study will run for four months, and no fishes will be intentionally harmed or killed in or after the study. If the results are positive, we’ll strategize about options for how we can produce the feed in larger quantities, and encourage farmers to switch to this feeding regimen. But first, in keeping with our commitment to evidence-based decision making, we’re waiting for the results of this study before deciding on how—or if—we move forward with a program. We’re excited to commence this study, and we look forward to sharing the results later in the year. Recent Posts","text",8

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/vietnam-survey","Lessons Learned from Our Farmer Survey in Vietnam Updated:May 5, 2021 We attempted to survey 41 fish producers in Vietnam and got zero responses. Here’s what we learned. The Summary Vietnam is the fourth-biggest producer of finfish worldwide. During our initialscoping visits, we found several common farming practices that infringe upon fish welfare in Vietnam. To further explore the welfare constraints present on Vietnamese fish farms, we attempted to gather data from farmers through avoluntarysurveysent directly to their company’s public email. Our intention was to find and use a cost-efficient way to remotely source survey results about on-the-ground conditions. Local advocates had voiced concerns about the effectiveness of email surveys and encouraged us to test out their assumptions.","text",2

The emails were typically of the format info@xxx or customerservice@xxx. We then developed a googlesurveywith 21 questions. Our Vietnamese-speaking friend from the Humane Society International, Trang Dang, kindly translated the survey for us (Thank you, Trang!). The survey took roughly 5-10 minutes to complete. We contacted the 41 companies with an email, in Vietnamese, explaining who we are, what we’re doing, and asking them to fill out the survey in order to help our scoping efforts in Vietnam. The emails were sent from an official FWI Gmail account and we used Mailtrack to monitor the number of recipients opening the email. We sent 3 emails in total between December 8 of 2020 to February 8 of 2021 (Table 1), and we did not provide remuneration for answering the survey.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/vietnam-survey","Table 1.Overview of emails we sent including content and responses. The Key Takeaways Cold emailing aquaculture companies does not seem to be an effective way to gather farm data in Vietnam, as none of the recipients answered. We got a 32-37% open rate for all rounds but yet none of the people that opened the emails actually answered the survey. It is likely that cold emailing does not reach the farmer him/herself, so the person opening the email (e.g. a secretary) would have to take the extra step to call or forward the email to the farmer. This may not be worth the effort for many. A more visually appealing HTML email format may or may not help, but in the case of our mini-trial, it did not. The extra 2 opens from our HTML format email were likely incidental. We shared our results with local advocates in Vietnam and they reinforced our assumption: Most farmers don't have an email, and/or don't check their emails. A far better way of reaching them may be via phone or by visiting them. If your organization is similarly keen on gathering data through this method, here are some of our suggestions: Consider adding anincentiveto answer the survey. (Note that we have not tried this method and thus do not know whether it would have yielded responses.) Obtain emails through a government database (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission) to ensure they are correct. Reach out to a particular person within the company or institution, rather than a general customer inquiry line, to increase personalization. Consider a different survey format, as it may be more effective (e.g., phone survey, Surveymonkey). Recent Posts","text",6

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/priority-species","Prioritizing Fish Species for Our China Work Updated:Jun 27, 2023 Fish Welfare Initiative’s work in China has seen usresearchthe welfare of farmed fishes in China,partnerwith the International Cooperation Committee of Animal Welfare (ICCAW), andco-hostthe first Aquatic Animal Welfare Forum at the World Conference on Farm Animal Welfare (WCFAW). Progressing further, we recently assisted ICCAW to identify 2 fish species to prioritize for welfare interventions in China—grass carp(Ctenopharyngodon idella), a freshwater species, andlarge yellow croaker(Larimichthys crocea), a marine species. While over 300 species are farmed in China, in varying living environments and with diverse welfare needs, these 2 priority species represent effective targets for developing welfare standards specific to Chinese aquaculture. In this post, we detail the evaluation criteria we used and why priority species are helpful to design welfare standards.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/priority-species","Animal Welfare Work in China China's aquaculture industry is responsible for almost57% of world productionand raises over 300 species of aquatic animals. We found that aquatic animal welfare is a relatively new sphere of research and offers many opportunities to identify roadmaps for future welfare work in China. To assist ICCAW in developing welfare standards, we conducted research, complemented byfield visits to Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Shanghaiin collaboration with ICCAW, to understand bottlenecks in improving welfare for aquaculture stakeholders.","text",5

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/priority-species","Selecting Priority Species Identifying criteria Our previous research informed much of our criteria for deciding which fish species should be prioritized (see pages 7–10 ofPrioritizing Fish Species for Effective Welfare Improvements). While there are 5 main criteria we used to identify priority species in the past, we chose to focus on only 3 of them:poor rearing conditions,number of fishes raised, andtractability. Seethe image belowfor an explanation of these criteria. We further subdivided poor rearing conditions and tractability to account for the Chinese aquaculture context.","text",7

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/priority-species","Our literature review and field visits provided important context for Chinese aquaculture and helped us refine our criteria. Primarily, the context-specific insights were: Most freshwater species are farmed in a polyculture system, i.e. multiple species are farmed together. By targeting the species reared in highest numbers in such farms (called the majority species) for welfare improvements, we can positively impact other species in the system as well. Species that are more industrialized in Chinese aquaculture, as opposed to those reared in small-scale family farms, make more realistic and practical targets for welfare improvements. Aquaculture farmers are likely to be more incentivized to prioritize and invest in the welfare of species considered more expensive or valuable in the market. Some criteria, although important, were not considered purely due lack of sufficient information and research available. Evaluating fish species A literature review of 280 peer-reviewed papers helped us evaluate all species of farmed fishes and then shortlist 8 freshwater species and 4 marine species for further analysis. All information required to evaluate these species against our selected criteria (explained inIdentifying criteria)was also obtained through additional literature review and 12 visits to aquaculture farms. We then ranked the 12 shortlisted species (seeTables 1and2below) based on all available data. As most of the available information was descriptive and not quantitative, this ranking remains subjective. Without a predefined numerical scale to compare all species against, some species ranked the same on certain criteria.","text",9

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/priority-species","Marine Species ​Preliminary Ranking by FWI Large Yellow Croaker 1 Seabass 2 Groupers Nei 3 Turbot 4 Note that grass carp, the freshwater species finally selected to be a priority species, ranked low in our preliminary rankings. This is explained by how each shortlisted species fared onour selection criteria. After the FWI team ranked the species, we consulted with three Chinese experts fromShanghai Ocean UniversityandZhejiang Universityto better understand the context of welfare interventions in China. Input from these experts helped us appreciate that species ranking high on our selection criteria don't necessarily make better targets for welfare interventions in China, based on other aspects specific to Chinese aquaculture. As an example, consider thepond loach. This species has high tractability, is frequently raised in poor conditions, and is farmed in significant numbers in China. However, pond loach farming is also limited to only some regions in China, and the species is not as widely known across all aquaculture regions as the grass carp. Improving welfare conditions for the pond loach, while being an important goal unto itself, would not be as impactful as focusing on a species that is better known among farmers, represented better in the aquaculture market, and more culturally ubiquitous. Therefore, following the expert recommendations, we performed weighted scoring of all our ranked species and reassessed our shortlist. These detailed evaluations forfreshwater speciesandmarine speciesare publicly available. Note that we did not perform fieldwork to evaluate farmers’ willingness to improve the welfare of marine species. This criterion was therefore left out of our analysis. Despite the inherent subjectivity of our approach, we believe that the ranking and selection process are valuable and shed light on a poorly-understood problem.","text",11
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/priority-species","Identifying two priority species Finally, we identified one freshwater species and one marine species as having the highest potential for building an impactful and effective welfare standard in China:","text",12
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/priority-species","Grass carp, the freshwater priority species widely consumed in China, accounts for 21% of all farmed species in China and is reared in intensive pond farming systems. Disease rates in grass carp still remain high and medicines for these fishes are often overused. Large yellow croakeris the most farmed marine species in China, reared in intensive cage farming systems. Their high disease rates have drawn the attention of the Chinese government, research, and society. We believe that identifying these priority species will catalyze important conversations and actions toward bettering the lives of farmed fishes in China. Our Upcoming Plans We will continue working with ICCAW and fish welfare experts to develop welfare standards for the 2 priority species: grass carp and large yellow croaker. In time, we hope this will further advance fish welfare in China through impactful and practical solutions. Want to help us reduce the suffering of fishes, or share your thoughts on our work?

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/philippines","Key Results Fish Helped We potentiallyimproved the lives of 10,000 fishthrough direct farmer engagement work, and may improve the lives of an additional 100,000 through the enforced implementation of the Municipal Ordinance. Improved Practices Community level:Through FWI's intervention, the local government is working to enforce the implementation of the Municipal Fisheries Management Ordinance, particularly**: 15-meter spacing between cages Reduced number of active farms in the bay Individual level: ​1 farmer reducing stocking densities from 150 fish/m³ to 37 fish/m³. 5 farmers began observing their fish during hand-feeding to adjust feeding amount and minimize feed waste that would lead to poorer water quality. We introduced the practice of record keeping to farmers, 3 of whom have adopted it. 2 farmers agreed to more frequent cage cleaning. Stakeholder Engagement Industry Regulation:Through FWI's intervention, the local government is now requiring fish cage operators to undergo training on best management practices, a policy that was previously unobserved. Farmers who obtained a certificate by attending FWI's seminar on Fishcage Operation and Management are eligible for a fish farming license. Collaboration:In partnership with the Municipal Agriculture Office of Carmen, Cebu, we presented in an Agri-Fishery Stakeholder Forum attended by over 60 participants. Cleaner Waters:After discussions with FWI, polluting boat shops committed to properly managing their effluent waste. **As of this writing, the extent to which the ordinance will be enforced is unclear. An update will be posted in early 2023.","text",45

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/feb-strategy-changes","Recent Strategy Changes: Investing More in Farmer-Centric Work Summary: Over the past two years of our work in India, FWI has operated three departments in parallel: farmer, corporate, and policy. Due to both (i) direct farmer work seeming more scalable than initially expected, and (ii) corporate and policy work seeming less able, in isolation, to incentivize large-scale farmer change, we are now centering the farmer work more in our theory of change. Over the coming years we expect to be scaling direct farmer work via similar structures as theAlliance For Responsible Aquaculture (ARA). We will continue investing in institutional incentives, including corporate and policy ones, primarily to further propel farmer participation in this program. Our Old Theory of Change: Equal Focus on Institutions and Farmers Following one of our regular re-evaluation points, FWI has made some changes to our high-level theory of change in India. This post discusses those changes. Ourprevious high-level theory of changewas the following: We work with institutions, particularly governmental and corporate ones, to support farmers in transitioning at scale to higher-welfare practices, which in turn improve the lives of fish. You can see this in diagram form here:","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/feb-strategy-changes","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6f025a_f0d28996e7bc454a87242fa612a193f8~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_740,h_146,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/6f025a_f0d28996e7bc454a87242fa612a193f8~mv2.png","image",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/feb-strategy-changes","In this model, equal weightage was put on institutions and farmers; also, we aimed to focus most inputs on institutions, who would then (hopefully) be able to change farmer practices at scale. With the information we had at the time, we thought this decision made sense: Direct farmer work is messy and resource-intensive, and thus other avenues seemed worth exploring. We were also heavily influenced by the success of Western animal advocacy organizations, who have achievedextraordinary impactby targeting corporations and thereby influencing many farms with a single point of input. However, two broad learnings made us rethink this strategy: Direct farmer work has proven more successful and scalable than previously expected. This is partly because farmers have seemed sufficiently incentivized by the benefits we provide to them (e.g. water-quality monitoring, lower disease incidence and mortality) to take up ourVersion 1 Standard. Ourcorporateandpolicywork, while having gained significant traction, have not proven likely to incentivize large-scale farmer change on their own (for instance, in the way thatThe Humane Leagueis able to do with corporate work in countries like the US). And with most of ourimpactcoming from our direct farmer work, we began to realize that getting institutions to influence farms wasn’t even the theory of change we were implementing. It became unclear whether we’d ever be able to implement this part of our theory of change cleanly in the Indian context. So, we are pivoting to a modified strategy, one that centers the approach that we have already demonstrated can generate a significant impact: direct farmer work. Our Modified Theory of Change: Focus on Farmers Our modified high-level theory of change focuses on farmer change, specifically with our farmer-centeredAlliance For Responsible Aquaculture (ARA)program. Our modified high-level theory of change is as follows:","text",4
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/feb-strategy-changes","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6f025a_64a5de78d74941e5938727ddbfa87005~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_49,h_20,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_auto/6f025a_64a5de78d74941e5938727ddbfa87005~mv2.png","image",5
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/feb-strategy-changes","Note that the main change here is our “institutions” work becoming “farmer engagement”—instead of viewing corporate and policy work as necessary and sufficient components of changing farmer behavior, they are now just one avenue of doing so, alongside other, more on-the-ground approaches like providing free water-quality monitoring and helping the farmers organize themselves into higher-welfare/best practice-mandated cooperatives. We wish to highlight a few key features of this shift : Focusing more on direct farmer work: With this modified theory of change, we are planning to scale in a similar way as theARAhas operated previously—via direct interaction with every farmer. Our initial hesitation with this approach was that it does not seem likely to be sufficiently cost-effective to warrant pursuing. Based on our experience so far with the ARA, we have recently updated in favor of our ability to make direct farmer work cost effective, specifically because we think our current programming could be made cost effective itself without any added incentives (see our very roughguesstimate). We also expect to add extra incentives in the future that will decrease our resource cost per compliant farm—seeThe role of institutionsbelow. Making theAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture (ARA)our signature program: As the ARA has been our direct farmer work program, the strategy change now makes it FWI’s main program. So, our policy and corporate work will now be overseen by the ARA lead instead of functioning within separate, parallel departments. The role of institutions: Previously, we viewed our institutions work as a somewhat separate process of helping fishes. For instance, we could work with a corporation and support them in mandating higher-welfare fishes in their procurement policies; then the corporation would implement that policy, and animals would live better lives for it.","text",6
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/feb-strategy-changes","As per the revised theory of change, we consider institutions as sources of incentives for farmer participation in the ARA—for instance, if we were able to secure market linkages with better-paying procurement deals for higher-welfare fishes, farmers will be more likely to enroll in the ARA and meet our higher-welfare standards. This is why now group all of our institutional work under the broad category ofFarmer Engagement, which will include both institutional and non-institutional work to motivate farmer participation.","text",7
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/feb-strategy-changes","Immediate Operational Implications While the new approach is partly just a shift in perspective, it is also accompanied by the following operational changes to support the revised theory of change: A new departmental structure at FWI, comprising: Farmer Engagement Department,whose mandate is to enroll and retain farmers in the ARA. Our staff from the previous corporate and policy departments are now part of this new department. Welfare Standard Department,whose mandate is to ensure that our welfare standard is implementable and impactful at scale. ARA Department,whose mandate is to guide farmers in implementing ourWelfare Standard. Changes to our annual and quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). As we make ourannual OKRspublic and linked in ourtransparency page, you can track our progress in real time. OurOKRs for 2023reflect the four components of our new theory of change while also considering potential fish welfare improvements we can support in other high-priority countries (this year, just China).

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2021review","Our 2021 Year in Review 2021 was a year of immense growth for Fish Welfare Initiative. We doubled our budget, tripled our team size, and transitioned from theoretical and scoping research to working on the ground in India with 2 local NGOs, 1 government agency, 1 corporation, and 58 fish farms. We have also grown with our international focus: In addition to our work in India, we now have smaller-scale projects in China and the Philippines. Growing sustainably at such a pace has brought many challenges—for instance, ensuring that all new staff are fully onboarded and ensuring that our welfare improvements are sufficiently impactful (see more below) have both at times proven difficult. However, such growth has also been immensely rewarding for our team and for our work, and we believe the metrics and highlights we include below speak for themselves, particularly the 400,000 fish whose lives we believe we improved. 2021 was also a year of reflection. Our initial programming—making welfare improvements with farmers and NGOs at a local level in India—has gained significant traction. But this approach, while it has proven immensely valuable in teaching us about Indian aquaculture and gaining broad support, in its current instantiation is unlikely to take us to the millions or even a billion fish helped that we intend to reach. To scale up to such heights of impact, our current plan involves a combination of supply-side farmer work, demand-side corporate outreach work, and governmental standards and buy-in, all built on the foundation of the farm-level welfare improvements that we are currently in the process of improving.

Looking beyond the metrics, the following are what we believe are our most important accomplishments in 2021: Launched Alliance for Responsible Aquaculture and expanded to 58 farms (India). In May, we launched the Alliance for Responsible Aquaculture (ARA), a collective of aquaculture stakeholders that are all committed to improving animal welfare in aquaculture. These stakeholders employ and/or support farming practices that are more natural for the environment (e.g. fewer chemical inputs), more fair for the farmers (e.g. via market linkages that help fetch farmers a welfare price premium), and of course more kind of the fish.The ARA is currently comprised of2 local NGOs,1 corporation, and 58 farms. In exchange for the farmers committing to improve fish welfare, FWI’s local field staff support them by providing free-of-cost water quality monitoring and advising them on health and welfare-related matters. Signed partnerships with 2 local livelihood NGOs (India). In the first quarter of the year, wesignedMOUs with both Gramodaya Trust and Association for the Rural Development, two livelihood-focused organizations that support farmers in two of the most concentrated fish farming regions in India (the West Godavari and Nellore districts of Andhra Pradesh). In these MOUs, both NGOs agreed to work with us to expand higher welfare fish farming practices to at least 50 farms per year (each) over the coming 5 years. The partnerships with these organizations have also proved critical for building local connections and support. Secured commitment with 1 corporation (India).In September,SAGE Organicsbecame the first corporation in India that we’re aware of to publicly commit to improving fish welfare in their supply chain. This commitment came after an in-person visit by several members of our team to SAGE’s farm.","text",4

In December, we signed an official partnership with theCentre for Science and Industrial Research(CSIR) to conduct a multi-year study assessing the impacts of various aquaculture practices on food safety, with a particular focus on higher welfare practices and the role of antibiotics. We will be sharing more on this developing partnership shortly. Onboarded 2 new part-time staff in China and the Philippines. Following up ourChinaandPhilippinesscoping reports, we have onboarded Lu Chen and Chiawen Chiang to continue our smaller-scale work in these countries. We mostly focused on relationship-building in 2021, and will shortly be sharing more about our planned work in these countries in 2022. Welfare Standard Development 2021 also had its share of challenges. Greatest among them was the apparent lack of efficacy our welfare improvements had on improving water quality and thus improving fish lives. Specifically, although our partner ARA farmers were largely stocking at our recommended levels and applying ourwater quality corrective actionswhere advised, we didnotobserve improvements in water quality as significant as we expected. We take this as a sign that ourcurrent producer commitmentis not comprehensive or substantive enough. In 2022 then, we plan to modify it. Several of our staff are currently assessing the viability of modifying our welfare commitment, with an eye for both the implementability by the farmers and the impact for the fish. Specifically, we are investigating more extensive stocking densities, feed management, aeration, and pond preparation. We are currently assessing the economic implications of these improvements and will begin trialing them with some of our more engaged farmers in April.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/scaleup","Our 2022 and Onwards Scaleup Plan By Karthik Pulugurtha and Haven King-Nobles This post discusses Fish Welfare Initiative’s plan for determining if, and if so how, to scale up in India over the next 4-6 years. Plan Summary Identify welfare improvements that are sufficiently implementable and impactful.We are not confident that ourcurrent welfare standardmeets our bar for either sufficient implementability or impactfulness, and we are not going to scale up significantly until we are. We will resolve this uncertainty by continuing testing with our farmers in theAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture(ARA), with the end goal of finding something that we can scale up via our process in step 2. Until we have an improved welfare standard,we will continue working with corporations and governmental entities in order to build both relationships and our knowledge of how to bring change in these systems. We believe that government and corporate work are both necessary now in order to enable greater scalability later. Furthermore, they increase the interest of farmers working with us now and give us redundancy. We will conduct some projects with these bodies, such as transitioning procurement at early adopting corporations (e.g.SAGE) and by working to develop standards that we can later help enforce (e.g. through the Bureau of Indian Standards).We expect these steps 1 and 2, completed concurrently, to be finished in mid-2023. If our impact evaluation concludes with positive results,we intend to scale up our work with both corporations and governmental entities. For corporations, this likely involves larger procurement commitments to transition their purchasing to ARA farms.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/scaleup","For the government, this may involve one or more of several different approaches, the most promising of which include working with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to require certain welfare-oriented standards for aquaculture and/or adding certain aquaculture best welfare practices as eligibility preconditions for government insurance.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/scaleup","When to Scale: After Finalizing Welfare Standard Current status of our welfare improvements: As of November 2021, we have field staff working with 52 fish farm ponds as part of the Alliance for Responsible Aquaculture, with a focus onwater quality and stocking densities. However, although farmers mostly implement theactions we recommendwater quality does not improve as frequently and as significantly as we would like. Stocking density changes are easier to implement, although our current stocking density cap does not seem to have made a measurable improvement to water quality. We know roughly what basic standards ought to be for carp welfare in India (seeour commitmentand ourreport), and we know that farms often do not meet these standards, but we're still less certain what practices farmers ought to implement to reliably meet these standards. Until we have these questions answered, we feel that it would be imprudent to significantly expand the implementation and enforcement of our standards. Method for Determining Welfare Improvements 1 - Preliminary impact evaluation We plan to conduct a preliminary test of the most promising 1 to 5 welfare improvements. This will involve taking environmental data as well as behavioral, physical, and physiological indicators of welfare (such as growth rates) as well as economic data. A positive result from both the preliminary impact evaluation would act as a ‘tripwire’ for us to move onto a large-scale impact evaluation, as well as progress with full scaleup of our strategy. 2 - Full impact evaluation After identifying preliminarily impactful welfare improvements, we will conduct a full impact evaluation, where we aim to implement standards as rigorously as possible in order to fully understand the welfare implications of our interventions. This will involve taking measurements not possible in the smaller scale preliminary tests, such as cortisol.","text",4
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/scaleup","A negative result from the full impact evaluation would be enough to make us slow down or stop scaling up. A positive result will be enough for us to change our internal philosophy from being in the exploration stage to being in the exploitation stage.","text",5
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/scaleup","After this, we will continue to collect data perpetually each year in order to reaffirm that our improvements are working. However, this will likely be significantly less data than currently being collected, especially for farms/farmer producer organizations who have already been working with us for multiple years. Our current focus is semi-intensive Rohu and Catla farms in the grow-out stage, with our aim being to develop expertise for these specific systems. However, we will continue to run small-scale surveys and trials with other groups, and stay open to pivoting or adding projects to address other fish groups. Why focus on a three-pronged approach with farmers, corporations, and governmental entities? Our default is to focus on as few of things as possible, and we recognize that running three intensive program areas simultaneously clashes some with that default. We don’t make this decision lightly—here’s our reasoning for why we think this is a good idea: We need to work with the Alliance for Responsible Aquaculture (ARA) in order to have a group of farmers who are interested and willing to test improved welfare standards. Working with farmers also gives us significant clout with corporations and policymakers, who see it as a “noble initiative.” There are synergistic effects to our credibility by working with each: Both the corporate and government work incentivizes farmer participation in the ARA. For instance, the possibility of someday selling to a large corporation at a welfare price premium increases farmer interest. And when farmers learn that we are working with a recognizable government institution, they (as well as the corporations) also gain greater interest. We are somewhat skeptical we can effectively scale up without corporate or governmental support. The corporate work speeds up our timelines for scaling, and the governmental work offers in expectation the greatest reach (though with longer time horizons).","text",6

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/scaleup","Possible Avenues for a Successful Scaleup The following are two possible avenues FWI could take in order to scale. We include them to give a sense of the strategies we may pursue later after we have resolved the question of our welfare standard. Conditional Subsidies Model The Indian government currently supports a large number of fish farmers through subsidies. These subsidies are offered by agencies likeNFDB,NABARD& State Governments and aim to help farmers: Set up new farms Renovate existing farms Cover production costs through low-interest loans Secure their investment through insurance schemes FWI could advocate for certain practices to be made prerequisites to apply for certain government subsidies (which makes some economic sense as well, given that higher welfare fish endure fewer mass mortality incidents). FWI intends to work with prominent government research institutes likeCSIR-IGIB,NEERI, and/orCIFAto produce compelling research advocating for the incorporation of higher welfare standards. The ARA will provide the farms to produce the research connecting sustainability and food safety to fish welfare. If these conditional subsidies were to be adopted by at least one state in India, they would potentially improve the lives of millions of fish. Audits from organizations like FWI must be made part of the process to ensure proper implementation of fish welfare on the farm. Market Implementation Model A reliable percentage of the Indian market has shown willingness to pay a premium for meat, milk, and eggs sourced from traditional or more ethical farms. Because fish products aregaining a reputationfor having a high chemical footprint, it is the perfect moment to transition the sector. What may be more compelling to producers and consumers is that Indian state governments havebegun cracking downon traders on these grounds. FWI could support the creation of brand labels that offer food safety through the incorporation of higher welfare practices.","text",8

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/scaleup","To strengthen the reach of higher welfare fish, FWI intends to produce compelling research connecting fish welfare and food safety through its projects with prominent government research institutes, such as the aforementionedCSIR-IGIB,NEERI, and/orCIFA. This research would also enable FWI to advocate for incorporating welfare standards requirements in government fish markets, which have the largest market share in the country.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/china-updates","Updates on Our Work In China Updated:Apr 27 In keeping with our value of transparency, we’re publishing this post to update our readers onFWI’s workto help fishes in China. Specifically, this post discusses: Our previous work in China. Why we are pausing our work. Our next steps in China. You can read more about each below. FWI’s Work in China Fish Welfare Initiative has been working to advance aquatic animal welfare in China since 2020. Our early projects included aScoping Reportand relationship-building with local stakeholders, including the International Cooperation Committee on Animal Welfare (ICCAW)—one of the key players in animal welfare in China. In early 2021, we first engaged our now China Specialist, Lu Chen, to help with this fast-growing program, particularly relationship-building with Chinese-speaking stakeholders. The following year, we co-hosted the first-everAquatic Animal Welfare Forumat the World Conference on Farm Animal Welfare (WCFAW). This event further embedded the welfare of aquatic animals among Chinese aquaculture stakeholders, including academics, nonprofits, industry, and government. Later that year, we conducted afield visitto explore farm conditions and further strengthen our understanding of aquatic animal welfare in the Chinese context. In the first half of 2023, our main focus was todefine priority speciesfor a welfare standard that ICCAW wanted to submit to the Chinese standards authority later this year. The standards have been drafted, and we are waiting for them to submit them to their team of Chinese aquaculture experts. Following this, we conducted another field visit and will shortly publish our findings. The second half of the year saw us co-host the World Farm Animal Welfare-Beijing Consensus Meeting at theFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. You can find more information about our projects in China on ourwebsiteandblog.","text",2

Relatedly, we and our current China Specialist, Lu Chen, have decided to part ways. We would also like to take this moment to publicly thank Lu for herconsiderable achievementstowards advancing fish welfare in possibly the most important country for fish welfare in the world.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/china-updates","As a result of these decisions, we are pausing our work in China. Our Next Steps in China We remain committed to advancing fish welfare in China and are currently considering our next steps, including potentially hiring for a Managing Director level role in the first half of 2024. We encourage you to contact us if you are interested in such a position or know someone who might be. We are extremely grateful to all those, especially the many advisors, who have supported this program in the past.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/why-fish-welfare","Business Resilience Higher welfare is the future of business. ​ The world is changing: People increasingly care about animal welfare, where their products originate from, and what kind of industry their purchase promotes (Conte, 2014;Lai et al., 2018;Buller et al., 2018). With more products than ever before, consumers can now choose between animal protein and new alternatives. The only way seafood producers can remain viable in this increasingly competitive and dynamic market is by offering high-quality, welfare-oriented products. Global markets, such as the European Union, have already introduced minimum standards for welfare and humane treatment (Buller et al., 2018). Exporting to these countries requires welfare to be a core part of production. Introducing higher welfare standards demonstrates that one is a leader, not a laggard, in this growing movement. The future profitability and resilience of the aquaculture sector lie in welfare-oriented products.","text",7

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/why-fish-welfare","Productivity & Efficiency Fish with higher welfare have better survival rates and increase farm efficiency. ​ Higher welfare and improved efficiency are closely correlated. Efficient production often reflects good animal health. This is partially because disease-infested fish populations are prone to higher mortality rates and reduced yields. Farmers who improve welfare note less aggression, reduced fin damage, improved growth rates, and improved feed conversion ratios (Stewart et al., 2012;Schneider et al., 2012). One study found that the introduction of aerators to enhance water quality increases survival rates by roughly 43%, which also boosts farm profit (Qayyum et al., 2005). ​ Appropriate transport and handling further reduce stress and mortality rates (FAO, 2008). Keeping suffering and stress affiliated with slaughter to a minimum is reported to ensure not only animal welfare but also high product quality (Holmyard, 2017). Welfare-oriented products are also appreciated by customers, who are willing to pay extra for welfare-friendly options (Lai et al., 2018;BENEFISH Final Activity Report, 2010). By improving welfare, farmers not only improve their efficiency, but can also sell their products for a price premium and increase their revenue.","text",9

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/why-fish-welfare","Worker Satisfaction Higher welfare means happier employees. ​ Farmworkers are generally aware that fish feel pain and that mortalities can be reduced by increasing welfare (Adams, 2019). Several farmworkers told us that they genuinely care about the fish they rear and would like to see welfare improvements on their farms. They acknowledge the importance of appropriate stocking densities and good water quality and worry about emerging diseases in aquaculture farms (Read, 2008). As they are concerned about fish well-being, workers expect that farm operations should minimize suffering. Operational guidelines that include welfare allow workers to improve fish farming conditions. Workers can actively contribute to higher survival rates, which increases their sense of job achievement. Higher welfare is thus the starting point for more fish-friendly operations and employees who fully believe in their work. A HealthySociety","text",11

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/why-fish-welfare","Food Safety Higher welfare helps to ensure a safe product. ​ Scientists proved that choosing a slaughter method that minimizes suffering is essential to guarantee high product quality (Poli, 2009). Stress before and during slaughter not only affects the fish but also leads to reduced quality. Fish products can contain bacteria, viruses, biotoxins, and parasites, all of which occur more frequently under poor welfare (EFSA, 2008&EFSA, 2009). Prolonged stress can also increase bacterial growth post-slaughter (EFSA, 2009). Reducing stress during cultivation and slaughter safeguards fish welfare. For example, effective stunning methods have been shown to reduce harmful post-mortem processes. As a result, high fish welfare ensures the humane treatment of fish and improves food safety.","text",14

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/why-fish-welfare","Disease Control Fish with high welfare have fewer diseases and parasites. The combination of pathogen presence and stressed fish leads to disease and parasite outbreaks. Most outbreaks relate to poor welfare (Aslesen et al., 2009;McClure et al., 2005). On farms, disease spread can induce financial hardship, food shortages, and even industry failure (Arthur & Subasinghe, 2002). Outbreaks cost the global aquaculture industry an estimated $6 billion per year and are the breaking point for the sector’s predicted growth (Stentiford et al., 2017). Diseases and parasites frequently spread to wild populations, where they may endanger entire ecosystems (Naylor, 2005). To combat diseases, farmed fish are commonly treated withantimicrobials.Yet these involve their own health risks: Antimicrobials promote the development ofultra-resistant bacteria strains,which can then leave fish and enter humans (EFSA, 2008). Humanely raised fish have better immune systems. This helps prevent infections, minimizes disease outbreaks, and reduces the need for antimicrobials.","text",16

Wastewater significantly contributes to eutrophication, causingalgal bloomsandocean dead zones(Global Aquaculture Alliance, 2019). Aquaculture waste also contains antimicrobials, leading to health problems if ingested by humans. Improved fish welfare reduces harmful wastewater generation: ​ Appropriate feeding systems reduce aggression, improve feed conversion ratios (FCRs), and leave less feed suspended in the water (Gan et al., 2013). Appropriate stocking densities and less crowding further enhance feeding efficiency and lead to better FCRs (Santos et al., 2010). Less stressed fish have better immune functions (McClure et al., 2005), decreasing the need forantimicrobials. Consequently, fewer antimicrobials end up in the surrounding environment.","text",20

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/why-fish-welfare","Ecosystem Health Higher welfare ensures the conservation of local species. ​ Aquaculture that is not welfare-oriented adversely impacts ecosystems in three ways: Diffused feed from aquaculture operations attracts wild fish. This, in turn, attracts larger predatory fish and mammals (Miller & Semmens, 2002) who are harmful to farm operations and who can injure themselves by becoming entangled in aquaculture gear (Barrett et al., 2018). Wild fish collected near farms are 16 times more likely to have diseases and parasites. These are easily spread between farmed and wild populations (Barrett et al., 2018). Fish frequently escape from farms and threaten local species by interbreeding, competing for resources, and transmitting diseases and parasites (Flatt & Ryan, 2017). Optimal farmed fish welfare decreases many of these risks. Under good welfare, fish eat more efficiently, and less feed is diffused to attract wild fish (Miller & Semmens, 2002). Fish are less susceptible to infections and parasites, thereby reducing the likelihood of spreading them to wild populations (Naylor & Burke, 2005). And fish who are less stressed appear to attempt fewer escapes (Cerqueira et al., 2020&2017). Better Lives for Fishes","text",22

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/why-fish-welfare","Farmed  Fishes High welfare is the right thing for fish. ​ Aquaculture is the fastest-growing food sector worldwide, and already today over 50% of seafood comes from farms (Ritchie & Roser, 2020). On these farms, between 73 and 180 billion fish are reared at any given time (Fishcount, 2019). In the future, aquaculture will likely expand much further and produce the majority of seafood consumed. Nevertheless, many fish reared in aquaculture continue to suffer greatly. Welfare issues include diseases, crowding, improper handling, poor water quality, and the inability to display natural behavior (e.g.,Animal Charity Evaluators, 2019,Cerqueira & Billington, 2020). Consequently, in most aquaculture farms, fish are exposed to constant stress and mortality rates are high (Ashley, 2007). ​ This suffering is unacceptable, because fish are sentient beings capable of feeling pain as much as terrestrially farmed animals (e.g.,Brown, 2014;Braithwaite, 2010;Riberolles, 2020;Babb, 2020). Even when there is no legal requirement, we have a moral obligation to provide them with a life worth living. To this end, humane rearing, appropriate transport, and slaughter methods that minimize suffering are essential.","text",25

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/why-fish-welfare","Marine Fish Conservation Higher welfare for farmed fish means less wild-caught fish. ​ One of the key arguments in favor of aquaculture is that it reduces the strain on wild fisheries. However, the reality is that aquaculture often increases overfishing due to the wild-caught fish used in fishmeal and fish oil. Farmed carnivorous fish consume vast amounts of fishmeal and fish oil (Naylor & Burke, 2005), the production of which accounts for almost 70% of wild-caught fish (Changing Markets Foundation, 2019). Producing fishmeal and fish oil impacts ecosystems through habitat modification, food-web collapse, and the introduction of non-native species (Changing Markets Foundation, 2019;Deutsch et al., 2007). Furthermore, food-web collapses and eutrophication decimate wild fish populations. Many coastal communities are reliant on fisheries, and population declines threaten their livelihoods (Changing Markets Foundation, 2019;Wijkström, 2009). Improving fish welfare through feed management decreases stress and causes fish to eat more efficiently (Martins et al., 2012). As a result, fish need less feed to sustain marketable weight. Less feed means fewer wild-caught fish are required, and thus alleviates overfishing impacts. Fish welfare is also an integral part of sustainable development.

We believe in highlighting the stories of local individuals with the implications of aquaculture and fish welfare within their own communities. If this is something you’re interested in,please reach out. In July of 2018, the Pacific Northwest welcomed a long overdue Orca calf into the Salish Sea. Onlookers all around the San Juan Islands reported this Orca calf swimming with its mother, Tahlequah, and their pod. There was immense excitement around the birth of this baby calf because of the declining Orca population in the area. Tahlequah’s baby meant hope for future survival of the pod Resident Orcas. Unfortunately, not even an hour later, this bright day turned gloomy. Tahlequah was seen once again, but this time carrying thecorpse of her newborn along her fin. News quickly broke that the calf had died, and many began mourning the great loss. Tahlequah continued to swim around with the corpse still on top of her head for over two weeks, eventually relinquishing her calf to the ocean for its final resting place. To this day, scientists and reporters are still unsure about how and why the calf died so suddenly.

However, the public was quick to recognize and criticize the detrimental effects of salmon aquaculture on the wild salmon populations in the region and, subsequently, the malnourished mother Orca.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/a-grieving-mother-and-the-perils-of-pacific-northwest-salmon-hatcheries","The Resident Orca’s main source of food is typically salmon, including Chinook (King), Coho, Pink, Chum, Sockeye, and Cutthroat. Each of these “keystone” species are essential to their biome. If removed, other species reliant on their existence will slowly collapse in a domino sequence. In the past decade, salmon run populations have declined due to various external factors. In response, the number of hatcheries has increased all around the Pacific Northwest, especially in the Salish Sea that connects Washington State with Canada. These fish farms have been built in order to prop up the impression of a thriving salmon population, when in reality it continues to decrease year after year. If hatcheries are built to help restore salmon populations, then why are return rates and populations still continuing to decline? The U.S. alone stocks and releases over3.6 billion fishinto the ocean; worldwide, this number increases exponentially from anywhere between 35-150 billion fish. Farmers release this obscene amount of hatchery fish every year, and yet nets are still turning up empty. The rationale in defense of this practice lays out a set of steps: produce large quantities of fish, release said fish into the ocean, thereby increasing the  population, which then allows fisheries to catch and sell more salmon overall. In reality, there are many more factors that contribute to the current rapid salmon decline, some even caused by the hatcheries themselves. Therefore, the actual solutions are far more complicated than simply adding more fish to the systems.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/a-grieving-mother-and-the-perils-of-pacific-northwest-salmon-hatcheries","Hatchery salmon are raised and bred to become the healthiest and strongest salmon possible in order for optimum survival rate when released. However, the process of breeding these “genetically superior” fish has begun to cause harm to the current wild salmon populations and the generations to come. Without the pressure of predation and the natural environment, hatchery salmon become a major competitor for resources once they merge with the wild populations. Within any fish habitat, the waters have a specific carrying capacity for both food and shelter. At that capacity, these resources are dispersed evenly throughout the salmon population. When hatchery salmon are released all at once, this capacity is quickly reached, leaving the weaker wild salmon withunsafe sheltered areas and significantly less food available. This dearth of resources follows the salmon up until the very ends of their lives, even affecting their ability to compete for optimal spawning grounds and the fertilization of females. If they aren't competing for food and resources, the wild salmon and hatchery salmon will eventually breed together. While wild salmon appear to be resilient to environmental changes, it’s unclear if this same resilience can be found in hatchery salmon. Each year, salmon at the end of their life cycles return home to spawn. For wild salmon, this usually means the stream they were born in, but for hatchery salmon, this means the hatchery in which they were raised. This leaves farmed salmon reliant on hatcheries for their entire lives Though juvenile farmed salmon are free from the pressures of predation and the natural environment, their lives are by no means easy. Their stress derives fromovercrowding, potential inbreeding, adaptation to captivity, low environmentally enriched enclosures, sudden environmental changes, and in some cases, being released into the ocean by helicopter, resulting in severe injuries or even death.","text",6
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/a-grieving-mother-and-the-perils-of-pacific-northwest-salmon-hatcheries","All of this avoidable stress accompanies them into their new ocean life and can make them more susceptible to disease, which can then cause the salmon to have lower survival rates long-term. When they breed with wild salmon, their genetics pass onto the next generation,lowering their overall fitness and reproduction rates further with each new generation.They are strong enough to compete against wild salmon for resources, but weak enough to only live a short life in the open ocean.","text",7

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/a-grieving-mother-and-the-perils-of-pacific-northwest-salmon-hatcheries","In the long term, if these salmon cannot survive on their own without the agricultural structures,then eventually the entirety of salmon populations in the Northwest may grow to rely on hatcheries. If the Northwest were to become too heavily dependent on hatcheries to provide salmon to the waters, it could create an unbreakable and unstable cycle. A disruption of water or power or a deadly outbreak of disease could devastate the hatcheries, leaving the runs barren of fish. Hatcheries provide a short-term relief to salmon decline, but cannot sustain numbers long enough to fully restore populations. After visiting a salmon hatchery in Bellingham, Washington, I found that this specific hatchery had actually had issues with return rates in the previous couple of years. The same year that Tahlequah lost her calf, Whatcom County had toend the fishing season six weeks earlydue low chum salmon return at Whatcom Creek, chum being the most abundant salmon in Washington State. In 2019, the same situation happened again, and Whatcom closed fishing five weeks early due to low returns. Reports for the 2020 season have not been released up until the time of writing this, but based on their recent record, there will most likely be an early closing date. It was clear to me at the time of visitation that large scale hatcheries like these have one goal in mind: to produce as many salmon as they can in order to maximize survival rates. It was also clear to me that this correlates with the goal of large scale fisheries as well, which is to catch the maximum amount of salmon possible each year without repercussions. The promotion of hatchery technology misleads the public into thinking they are a necessity for wild salmon populations. These facilities seem to care about productivity and marketing more than the restoration of wild salmon populations.","text",9

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/a-grieving-mother-and-the-perils-of-pacific-northwest-salmon-hatcheries","Salmon are one of the most celebrated fish worldwide and yet they may go completely extinct within the next twenty years due to continual human interference. Restoration of these populations must focus on exponentially lowering the amount of salmon that can be fished every season until we see stable population sizes, as well as halting construction in critical salmon habitats, including dams, deforestation, and stream alterations. Clearly, the hatchery method of simply adding more fish to plummeting populations is not going to miraculously start working. If we continue down this path, not only will salmon cease to exist, but Orca families like Tahlequah’s, as well as many other species, will follow suit. We need to shift our focus to helping wild salmon recover instead of endlessly trying to introduce new salmon that do not belong.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/fish-groups","Fish Groups Utilized by Humans Updated:Jul 21, 2020 With roughly 33,600 species of fish worldwide, it comes as no surprise that humans have found numerous ways of utilizing them for easing their hunger, obtaining experimental results, and treating diseases. This post will highlight the biggest groups of fish, give a short description of their respective group, and welfare issues they encounter. As an organization, we focus on farmed fish because such interventions involving aquaculture are more tractable. Humans oversee the full life span of farmed fish as opposed to, for example, wild caught-fish (seeWelfare Issues of Farmed and Wild-Caught Fish). However, we want to have the highest possible impact on fish’s lives and are therefore open to widening our work in the future on other groups. We alsostrongly encourage other organizations to work on these groupsbecause they are mostly neglected but have substantial welfare concerns. Updates June 1, 2020: Resource added with numbers for farmed food fish, feeder fish, and farmed cleaner fish. (19b.Šimčikas, S. (2020).Estimates of global captive vertebrate numbers.) May 14, 2020: Resource added on skeletal deformities in cleaner fish (46. Gunnar Fjelldal, P. et al. (2020).Skeletal deformities in wild and farmed cleaner fish species used in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar aquaculture.) May 4, 2020: Resource added on welfare problems for baitfish (37b. Riberolles, G. (2020).Pêche au vif: vivement la fin!) Ornamental Fish Fish used for aquariums and hence kept for visual appeal in aquaria rather than as a food source are described as ornamental fish or “pet fish” [1]. Hobby fish-keeping accounts for 99% of ornamental fish trade, for which individuals are either captured in the wild (which is the case for 98% of marine fish species) [2], or reared in captivity on fish farms (which is the case for 90% of freshwater fish species) [3].","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/fish-groups","While theFood and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO)tries to estimate numbers for the ornamental fish trade, there is little information about the sector’s actual scope. A study from 2007 suggests that over 1 billion ornamental fish are traded per year worldwide [4]. Numbers from 2010 suggest 2 billion individuals moved annually [5]. Asia is the biggest exporter with 51% of global exports [5]. In 2013, Singapore alone exported ornamental fish worth 56m USD to over 80 countries worldwide[5].","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/fish-groups","Welfare Concerns for Ornamental Fish There are welfare issues present both before and after the fish are sold.Prior to purchase, inappropriate handling, and rearing conditions (e.g. poor water quality, malnutrition, and inter- & intra-specific aggression) often evoke stress and suffering [6]. This explains the10-40% mortality rates prior to exportof an ornamental fish farm in Bali, Indonesia [7]. During transport, ornamental fish are usually anesthetized and packed alive into small plastic bags with little water quality monitoring [8]. With 99% of ornamental fish kept by private persons, we can expect there to belittle monitoring of their welfareafter they are purchased. These conditions evoke great concern about their welfare. Fighting Fish Betta fish or “Siamese fighting fish” (Betta splendens) are an eye-catcher at every pet store.In Thailand, betta fish are the most exported aquatic animal with trades bringing in billions of bhats(THB)(1 THB = 30.4 USD) annually [9]. One betta fish farmer in Phnom Penh, Cambodia claims to sell up to 30 fish a day making roughly 90 USD [10]. When not kept for visual appeal, male betta fish (and sometimes females) are used for fish fights due to males’ aggressiveness against each other.Their territoriality and high aggressiveness lead them to start biting, pushing, and injuring each other when put into the same container or tank[11,12]. Research on the legal status of such fights is not fruitful, with little information about where these fish fights are allowed or not. It appears though that in Indonesia animal fighting can generally lead to imprisonment [13].","text",4

Source:PETA Fish for Restocking Recreational fishing is a popular sport worldwide, with 3.36 million individuals taking part in it in Australia in 2003, 49 million in the United States in 2017, and 4.2 million in Europe in 2005 [17]. Inthe U.S., the number of recreational fishers has increased by 56%between 2006 and 2017[18]. Increased fishing activities, both recreational and commercial, reduce fish populations in rivers and lakes. On top of that, climatic warming alters reproductive cycles and induces further stress on wild fish stocks. To combat declining fish populations, fish farms rear restocking fish which are then released in large numbers toincrease stock numbers, improve stocks for commercial and recreational fishing, and add highly desirable individuals(game species) [19]. At any given point 0.8 to 65 billion fish are reared of which 35 to 150 billion are released annually[19b]. Welfare Concerns for Restocking Fish For general welfare concerns for fish on fish farms, seeour reportandthereport by Animal Charity Evaluators. Also see thereport by Rethink Prioritieson welfare issues specific to restocking fish. A major welfare concern of restocking fish isstress upon release into an unknown environment[20].Farm-raisedfish are less suited for survival than their wild counterparts which are generally well adapted to their environment [21]. In addition to that, released fish might becomesubject to recreational fishing.

Source:University of Queensland, 2018 Welfare Concerns for Laboratory Fish Animal experiments can intentionally cause intense suffering. Fish toxicity tests are very popular [26], with theLD50 test still allowed on fishwhile it has been outlawed as a worldwide standard for all mammals [27]. There areno international welfare guidelines for specific fish species used in laboratory experiments, and suggested guidelines are more liberal than for mammals[28]. Such guideline suggestions comprise experiment set-up parameters (for example water quality) which are not kept constant and lead to the needformore experiments (involving more fish) to achieve acceptable results[28]. Health monitoring appears to be sparse and is mainly done for whole populations rather than individuals[28].This Increases the risk of overlooking individual health issues and thus allowing for increased suffering of individuals. Fish Used for Medicine Fish used for medicine either originate from fish farms or are wild-caught. A common form of medical fish therapy isIchthyotherapy. It describes the use of “doctor fish of Kangal” (Garra rufa) for thetreatment of skin diseases such as psoriasis and eczema. Garra rufa, native to Turkish mountain regions [29] is now found in “foot spas” across the world [30]. Other fish groups such astilapia are used to treat second- andthird-degreeburns[31]. Their non-infectious and highly moist skin contains collagen proteinsthatprevent scarring and promote healing [32]. So far, most fish skin demand for burn treatment seems to come from Brazil. Brazilian pig and human tissue supply is significantly lower than in Western countries and can thus not be used for burn treatment as frequently [33].","text",15

Fish are starved to make them search for food on human skin and thereby remove dead skin parts. Human skin is largely composed of keratin, which is barely digestible and does not provide sufficient nutritional value for the fish[30]. Without proper monitoring, water quality in small tanks can quickly decrease due toammonia build-up and insufficient aeration. Another cruel operation is heating tank water to 36-40°C to verifyGarra rufa's “authenticity”[30].This causes severe suffering and even death of “non-authentic” individuals (only the Turkish mountain species will survive these temperature extremes). Welfare monitoring for fish used in medicine is limited in the UK and non-existent in other countries[30]. Baitfish The primary purpose of baitfish is not direct consumption but theattraction of larger predatory species[35]. According to a publication by theU.S. Southern Regional Aquaculture Center, roughly 50% of baitfish are farm-raised while the other half are caught from the wild. Numbers of baitfish produced per year are hard to track and there are conflicting estimates even within countries. For example,in the U.S., baitfish production per year ranges from 1.17 to 6 billion[36, 19b]. Common freshwater baitfish families include carp, minnow, sucker, and shad. For saltwater, popular baitfish include anchovies, herring, gudgeon, and halfbeaks [37]. For an assessment of how effective lobbying for stricter baitfish regulations in the U.S. can be, see thisarticleby Saulius Šimčikas fromRethink Priorities.","text",17

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/fish-groups","In cases where baitfish are thrown out without being hooked, they might be alive, dead or immobile from injuries and/or exhaustion. More welfare issues arise at the point of death, which often culminates in the fish being eaten alive or having parts of their body bitten off. The welfare of baitfish ischallenging to monitordue to the missing supervision of recreational and commercial fishing practices. Feeders Raised at fish farms or caught from the wild, feeders are not directly consumed. Instead, they are fed to predatory species in private households, zoos, lakes, and the ocean. A large portion of feeder fish is further processed into fishmeal and fish oil by drying and grinding them. Fishmeal was used as fertilizer until 1917 when, due to its high nutritional value, farmers used it to feed livestock [38]. As such, there is a far higher demand for fishmeal than single countries could produce and it is exported around the world.Worldwide 460 to 1,100 billion fish are “reduced” to fishmeal and fish oil every year[39].","text",19

(2014) Welfare Concerns for Feeders For fish that are live-fed, the potential for suffering is similar to baitfish with a high amount ofstress and anxiety caused by the release into an unknown environmentin close proximity to predators. Fish used for fishmeal are often caught and reared inhumanely, with high demand pushing for rapidly producing and capturing billions of individuals. Due to the international market of fishmeal, there islittle concern for monitoring the welfare of fish used for fishmeal, particularly in countries where fish welfare regulations do not exist. Cleaner Fish Farmed salmonids greatly suffer from sea lice infestations, which reduce growth, feed conversion ratios (FCR), and market prices (due to skin damage). Additionally, lice infestations facilitate secondary infections and generally increases mortality rates [40]. As an alternative method to stressful delousing [41],cleaner fish are added to such stocks to remove dead skin, ectoparasites, and/or infected skin and gill parts. This symbiotic relationship is a natural phenomenon and has been suggested to effectively manage parasites (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) in the “client fish” [42]. However, variousscientists doubt its effectiveness[43]. Species from the family wrasse (Labridae) [44] as well as Cyclopteridae (lumpfish) are commonly used as cleaner fish. Cleaner fish were mainly caught from the wild until around 2011 when demand for healthy individuals forced the industry to start farming them under controlled conditions [45]. By 2018 close to 90 million cleaner fish were kept on farms worldwide[19b]. Welfare Concerns for Cleaner Fish Fish Welfare Initiative talked to an employee from North-European fish farm who pointed out that most polyculture systemsfocus on the welfare of their selling species (e.g. salmon) as opposed to the cleaner fish (e.g.","text",21

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/fish-groups","Welfare is ensured to the extent of keeping their naturalbehaviorof cleaning intact in order to execute their primary and sole function on farms: delousing. This creates ahigh-stressenvironment. A recent study found that poor bone health and skeletal deformities due to this mechanical stress are common in wrasse [46]. Stressful rearing conditions also make forhigh mortality rates among cleaner fish[47]. Wild wrasse and lumpfish are diurnally active and prefer to hide under rocks and seaweed during the day [45]. Display of this naturalbehavioris impossible on most farms unless shelter obstacles are purposely introduced into the tanks/cages. After their delousing lifetime (which can be as short as one season for lumpfish), cleaner fish are usually processed with the unused parts of salmon. There appears to be no information about how humane this death is and whether fish are desensitized first (it seems likely they are not). Mercy Releases An oldBuddhistpractice commonly referred to as “fang sheng”, “live release”, “mercy release”, and “prayer animal release”, suggests therelease of captive animals to create good karma[48]. It is practiced in countries around the world including Taiwan, China, Thailand, Singapore, Nepal, India, Australia, France, England, and the United States. In Taiwan alone, 200 million animals are released annually, with releases several times a month [49]. While traditionally an act of compassion, this practice is increasingly criticized for releasing previously captured animals, often into foreign environments. Welfare Concerns for Mercy Releases While waiting for their release, fish are often kept in small buckets with questionable water quality and many individuals crowded together. The resulting stress and anxietycontinuewhen entering a new environment. Having grown up on farms, these fish are oftennot capable of surviving in the wild. When released into the wrong environment (e.g.","text",23

Introducing non-native species also has the potential of challenging local species, and increasing their mortality rates [48]. During our field research, we have heard accounts of fish released while still in plastic bags, as well as sellers catching the released fish again to re-sell them after.","text",24
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/fish-groups","Farmed Fish Fishraised in hatcheries and reared under human care until their processing stageare commonly referred to as farmed fish. Farming systems are generally distinguished as being extensive, intensive, or semi-intensive (seehere) and can either be situated inland (e.g. intheform ofRecirculating Aquaculture Systemsand ponds) or in the ocean (mariculture). Fish farms are often the first life stage of various fish groups represented above(baitfish, feeders, fish for medicine, restocking fish, ornamental fish, cleaner fish, mercy releases). Other groups include fish farmed for human consumption and for fertilizer, as well as those farmed for glue & medicine production. At any given point, 73 to 180 billion fish are reared exclusively for human consumption [50]. 90 billion fish are slaughtered each year[51]. Interestingly an estimated 15 to 1,000 billion fish die on farms before they even get slaughtered [51]. Welfare Concerns for Farmed Fish Seeour report(p.4-8) andthereport by Animal Charity Evaluators. Wild fish From 2007 to 2016 between 0.97 and 2.3 trillion fish have been caught from the wild worldwide [52]. While fishing practices date back 500,000 years, they experienced a major boost in technological advancement during the 19th century [53]. In a pastreport,we listed the most common capture methods for open-ocean fishing practices includingtrawling,purseseine,longline,and gill nets. Individual numbers of recreational fishers fluctuate between 220 and 700 million annually, the higher border being twice the number of commercial fishermen [54]. While recreational fishing sees more people involved, the advanced equipment of commercial fisheries allows for much higher yields. Wild-caught fish are generally used for the same purposes as farmed fish, including those purposes represented above (baitfish, feeders, fish for medicine, restocking fish, ornamental fish, cleaner fish, mercy releases).","text",25

Still, many feel a moral obligation to minimize that suffering, especially given the rise of industrial-scale production and the cost-saving methods involved. And over the past few decades, mounting concern for animal welfare has forced the farmed animal industry to improve conditions. But there’s something missing. Strangely enough,fish have been left out of the conversation. Absent significant public pressure, the fishing and aquaculture industries have largely ignored welfare as an integral part of production. However, commonly employed catch and slaughter methods have come under increased scrutiny by academics and regulatory bodies in recent years. But it still isn’t clear how interested the average consumer is in fish welfare. Do consumers attribute sentience, the ability to feel pain, and other such qualities to fish as they do to terrestrial farmed animals? How informed is the general public about their countries’ fish and animal welfare laws? In this blog post, we’ll take a look athow people across South America value fish welfare. Suffering is Intuitive Though research on public attitudes in South America is still developing, several important studies offer some insight into the region. A2017 studyof college-educated consumers conducted in Brazil and Colombia indicated thatmost respondents(75%)were convinced of fish sentience and their ability to suffer, despite the lack of regulations reflecting those beliefs in both countries. The overwhelming majority (93%) said that fish suffer when removed from the water, and roughly 80% did not consider catch and release angling an acceptable practice. 56% were previously unaware of efforts towards humane fish farming and slaughter methods.","text",4

Fish farms were middling at 36% (See Fig. 1). In conventionally benign scenarios such as aquarium exhibits (18%) and keeping fish as pets (12%), estimates were low enough to suggest that even this well-educated segment of the population was uninformed on the harmful practices typically involved. The authors concluded that while the perception of high suffering in several scenarios was promising for welfare advocacy, there was a clear need to further educate the public on the harm fish endure in captivity.","text",7

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/attitudes-south-america","Political Map of South America (Image credit: Cacahuate, amendments by Joelf and Globe-trotter, CC BY-SA 3.0) So Why are Regulations so Elusive? As mentioned in the previous study,there are currently no substantive regulations governing fish slaughter in South America[1]. Animal welfare legislation goes back as far as 1891 in Argentina, but much of Central and South America had nothing on the books until the 21st century [2]. And while these recent additions offer some cause for celebration, the existing laws exclude fish from humane slaughter regulations due to the lack of consensus on how to properly stun them. But even as South America has largely remained stagnant on fish welfare, progress is being made elsewhere. According to Ana Silvia Pedrazzani, Ph.D at the Federal University of Paraná, Brazil, humane standards have been developed for salmon slaughter in Western European aquaculture. In this case, the sector was happy to underwrite the extensive experimentation required, as the time and cost was justified by consumer expectations and salmon’s high market value. However, it’s questionable whether the same conditions will occur in other markets. That isn’t to say humane slaughter for all fish is impossible—it’s just that there is no market incentive to implement it, and we haven’t properly invested in determining species-appropriate methods. For instance, Pedrazzani has been trying to secure funding for research on a humane Tilapia slaughtering machine since 2009, without success. She has made progress on other fronts, however, andrecently publisheda first-of-its-kind welfare assessment protocol for Brazilian Tilapia farms, using key health, nutritional, environmental, and behavioral indicators.","text",9

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/attitudes-south-america","Dr. Ana Silvia Pedrazzani recently published the first welfare assessment tool forBraziliantilapia farms. The salmon stunning method is not universally effective. Despite inadequate research to prove it, the most commonly farmed species’ neuroanatomy and physiology differ enough thata “one size fits all” approach to stunning cannot reasonably exist. The most common method Pedrazzani has encountered in her domestic research, icing, causes obvious, severe suffering, but is believed to be sanitary and preserve meat quality. While anesthesia is commonly used in laboratory settings, many countries prohibit its use on commercially-sold fish due to fear of contamination. New Zealand is one of the few that does authorize anesthesia, using a clove oil derivative that is considered safe and highly effective. Given the state of development in humane techniques, it will require more than education and advocacy to address the lack of public awareness identified in the 2017 study.Governments and NGOs will need to fund research on high-welfare techniques during capture, production on farms, and at slaughter. The Potential is There We have a sense of consumers’ beliefs and preferences, but what about the workers that actually catch and handle the fish? In a2008 study, Brazilian researchers interviewed workers and customers at a municipal fish fair and a bus station. On the question of sentience, the vast majority (>85%) agreed that fish feel pain. A similar percentage admitted that some slaughter techniques cause suffering, but only about half of respondents agreed that meat quality is worsened by these techniques [3]. Fewer than 1 in 10 had ever heard of humane slaughter.After showing fish cleaners a humane slaughtering technique, the authors reported that 83% adopted it and 75% agreed that it didn’t interfere with their work. Another barrier to improved fish welfare could be consumers’ budget constraints.","text",11
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/attitudes-south-america","In a2014 surveyconducted in Lima, Peru, researchers sought to understand consumer preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for fish raised under different conditions and government certification schemes. Those surveyed were broadly representative of the local population, and indicated a preference for wild-caught fish overall, in terms of the highest WTP. Things got more interesting as they worked their way down the preference ranks, however.","text",12
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/attitudes-south-america","Fish raised in wastewaterwithoutcertification garnered a higher WTP than the same fishwithcertification. The authors speculated that this reflects a distrust of government regulatory bodies, which are not perceived as independent certifying institutions and may be vulnerable to corrupt schemes. Meanwhile, consumers put an intuitively higher WTP on freshwater-raised fish, which increased even higher with certification. Additional questions to understand their motivations suggested thathigher WTP was closely related to the perception of a safer product. They were more concerned about farming practices from a public health perspective than one of welfare.","text",13

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/attitudes-south-america","A fishmonger at the Mercado de San Camilo, Arequipa, Peru (Image Credit: A. Davey, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) A Growing Trend Recreational fishing in South America is a relatively new phenomenon, supplementing commercial and subsistence fishing, so it’s no surprise thatlittle researchis available on this quickly growing segment of the industry. Studies in Brazil [4] have indicated a large gap between state-issued angling licenses, of which 370,000 were granted in 2014, [5] and the actual number of active anglers, which may be as many as 10 million.It is virtually impossible to enforce humane capture and slaughter in recreational fishing, so there could be widespread use of inhumane practices. Though no formal study on public acceptance of recreational fisheries in the region has been conducted to date, fisheries have faced little public resistance as they’ve continued to crop up over the years. Pedrazzani believes that the movement for fish welfare is also hindered by “neophobia,” or suspicion of an idea that undermines tradition. In this case, there is fear that the ritual of a father taking his son out fishing might become a casualty of onerous regulations. Just Getting Started Though research on fish welfare sentiment in South America is still in its infancy, these studies establish a solid foundation to build on. We saw thatboth consumers and producers know fish feel pain.Many were interested in minimizing suffering at the point of slaughter, where the potential for unnecessary harm is readily apparent. But few were informed enough to be disturbed by the conditions fish are raised and caught in.Even the most sympathetic consumers were not aware that there are no regulations. And though college-educated consumers, in particular, were convinced of fish sentience and supportive of welfare protections, we can’t be certain that most South Americans conceive of fish welfare as intrinsically valuable.","text",15
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/attitudes-south-america","We saw concerns rooted in human health consequences, such as diet and the use of antibiotics, but that shouldn’t be confused with a genuine interest in welfare. Producers were primarily concerned with hygiene and meat quality, so pain was minimized only where practical.","text",16
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/attitudes-south-america","This is not simply a matter of corruption or apathy. We still have yet to produce proven, species-specific stunning techniques for even the most common species on the continent. Whatever methods are employed until then will be an educated guess at best. Though, if the rising enthusiasm for animal welfare is any indication, we can anticipate greater interest in funding the prerequisite research, as well as increased pressure on regulatory bodies to enact enforceable standards for fish welfare. In the meantime, unfortunately, it is business as usual. We are grateful to Dr. Pedrazzani and the team from Vegetarianos Hoy for sharing their expertise on the region and giving feedback.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/ara-expansion","The ARA Is Expanding to a New Region Updated:Jul 20 Current Regions of Operations TheAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture (ARA), FWI's primary program for improving the lives of farmed fishes, currently operates in two districts of Andhra Pradesh, India: Eluru¹and Nellore. Currently, we support 44 active farms in Nellore and 98 farms in Eluru. Given the high number of farms and frequent water quality issues in Eluru, we are focusing our expansion efforts there, working within 13 villages. These villages are highlighted in purple onthis map. Reasons for Further Expansion We see various values in expanding the ARA beyond the existing villages and regions: Knowledge Generation: Moving to new regions gives us further insights into prevalent welfare issues and potential interventions, further assisting our R&D work. We also learn about common farm properties and different life stages. For example, when we moved from our first region, Nellore, to Eluru, we realized that farms in Eluru are much bigger, have lower stocking densities, and don’t commonly employ welfare-enhancing practices (e.g., aeration, pond preparation) like farmers in Nellore. These findings informed our welfare intervention research process significantly. Building a Skilled Team: In expanding to new areas, we are growing our ARA team. The team also gains valuable skills in program management that will be essential for running any field-based program. Efficient Scale-up of Future Interventions: We may decide to change our intervention based on the results of ourR&D studies, and if we do, it will be beneficial to already have farmers organized within an alliance through which we can introduce these welfare improvements. Creating Clout: We expect that to successfully help hundreds of millions of fishes in India we will further need to work with local governments. Our experience has shown that having a critical number of farmers involved with our work creates credibility and clout for policy and legal work.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/ara-expansion","Helping Fishes: All of the above and, in particular, adding more farms will allow us to help more fishes and thus increase our impact. Pedapadu: The ARA’s New Region of Expansion This year, we have already added 40 farms and plan to add 60 more in a new area. Currently, all our farms in the Eluru district are in the Eluru mandal, and we plan to expand to the Pedapadu mandal. For context, a mandal is a geographic unit smaller than a district and similar to a municipality.","text",3

We want to more easily enable external people to analyze our data for themselves. It is in keeping with our values of transparency. While we have put significant efforts into quality control and error correction with this data, we would still like to note a few disclaimers: There are still probably significant sources of error in this data, including equipment and human error. The fish farms we work with are complex ecosystems in themselves, and it is often challenging to make broad conclusions based on a few samples (e.g. low oxygen in one place in the farm is not necessarily indicative of low oxygen throughout). The measures we are currently taking (e.g. water quality measures) are only proxies—and imperfect ones, at that—for animal welfare. We plan to continue to publish this data roughly annually.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-2023","Strategy Update: Broadening Our Research Mandate in India Updated:Feb 19 Earlier this month, we gathered most of our team together in Vijayawada, India, to discuss FWI’sIndia plansfor 2024. Those meetings resulted in the following priorities: Research & Development: We are planning to conduct several in-field studies to identify and test promising interventions. R&D will be a greater focus of the organization in 2024. It is also now our largestbudgetallocation. Program Implementation: We are aiming to add 100 new farms to our current farmer program in India, theAlliance For Responsible Aquaculture(ARA). However, an equally large focus for this program will be on innovating new models within it—see morebelow. Policy and Other Stakeholder Work: Although this is not our primary focus, we will continue building relationships with policymakers and other parties who may enable us to scale. For more information on our specific goals and plans for next year, see our 2024OKRsandbudget. The rest of the post mainly focuses on the following two strategy changes: We are broadening the mandate of our R&D to look into alternative programs, not just alternative welfareimprovements for our current farmer program (the ARA). Similarly, as mentioned above, our farmer program will focus more heavily on innovating novel strategies. This post doesnotinclude much discussion of eithera)our work in China, orb)the results from our 2023 work, although we plan to publish posts on each within the next 2–3 months Lastly, we are now also beginning to fundraise again to fill our 2024 funding gap. If you are considering donating, or for more information on the value of a donation to FWI, see ourDonation Page FAQ. As always, comments and suggestions are most welcome! We are extremely grateful to all those who, financially and otherwise, have enabled theimpactwe have achieved and the potential we have built thus far.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-2023","Update 1: Broadened Mandate of Our Research Given the understudied nature of the welfare issues (e.g. with Indian major carp species) that we seek to address, FWI has always had to invest significantly in research. Over the past 2–3 years, this research has focused primarily on welfare improvements in a particular context—specifically, we sought to answer the question “Which welfare improvements are most cost effective, given that they are implementeda)at the growout (i.e. adult) life stage, andb)via a monitoring program like ourcurrent farmer program?” In other words, we aimed to determine which welfare improvements fit best in our already pre-establishedtheory of change.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-2023","Now, we are broadening the mandate of our research to explore other theories of change, in the hopes that they could be more impactful than what we are currently running. Instead of just focusing on our current farmer program, we will be researching other promising interventions entirely. The following are some of the implications of this change: Departmental name and leadership change: Our previousWelfare Standard Department, which was focused on identifying promising welfare standards (e.g.,e.g.) has now been renamed theResearch & Development Department. We have also hired a new departmental lead on this project, Dr. Paul Monaghan, who has previous experience in managing and designing studies for multimillion-dollar public health programs. Studies to be run next year: Per ourOKRs, we will be running several studies of alternative programs in India over 2024. We are currently in the process of narrowing down which exact studies to run, and will publish our planned schedule on our blog in the coming two months.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-2023","Update 2: Greater Focus on Innovation in Our Farmer Program Relatedly, our farmer program in India is investing comparatively more in innovating new strategies for welfare improvements delivery (and comparatively less in optimizing our current strategy). While our program for the past year has focused pretty consistently on stocking density caps and monthly monitoring visits to give water quality corrective actions, over the coming year we’re interested in exploring more structural changes such as the following: Stocking density measurement changes: One challenge that has recently arisen is the revelation that, possibly for various reasons including inaccurate acreage estimates of the farms we work with, true stocking densities may have been higher than what we understood them to be. One of our projects this quarter is to determine if there are more accurate ways of measuring densities in these contexts, and, if so, to implement them. Monitoring visit scheduling changes: We currently visit each farm monthly, regardless of its past history of welfare issues or other factors. We plan to investigate whether a different scheduling algorithm would detect a greater number of welfare issues. Measurement type changes: Recent tests have thrown into doubt the accuracy of the water quality meters we use, so we are investigating different types of measurements. For instance, we are currently exploring theWinkler Methodto assess dissolved oxygen based on samples we bring to our office/lab, as opposed to using the meter at the farm. Farm and regional changes: We are planning to further diversify the farm demographic of our ARA by adding more farms of other life stages, such as rearing ponds and/or nurseries. We will also add farms in a new region next year.","text",6

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-2023","Reason for Changes: Limitations with Our Current Model While we previously did seelimitationsof our current welfare standards,we feltthat the underlying model—regular visits to growout farmers to implement some kind of welfare standard with them—was sufficiently promising to scale. Now, we’re not so sure (though we do believe our current model model has hadmoderate impact). Over the past few quarters, we’ve come to have significant doubts that this model of helping fish in India has sufficient long-term cost-effectiveness and scalability. More specifically, we’ve become more concerned of  the following limitations with our current model: Insufficient per-fish magnitude of impact: Most of the ways we currently help fish are by alleviating particularly poor instances of water quality—for instance, if our data collector measures extremely low oxygen in a farm, we advise the farmer to take immediate corrective actions to alleviate the issue. However, in most cases these corrective actions do not seem to be particularly lasting improvements throughout the animals’ lives, suggesting that our impact per-fish (for instance, ourDALY-equivalent) is less than we believe we could otherwise achieve. Additionally, once-monthly visits inevitably mean that the majority of welfare issues go unnoticed by us. Insufficient evidence base: Related to the above issue, we currently lack a sufficient evidence base on welfare improvements for Indian major carp (our target species), and feel that we must spend more effort building this base. It’s worth noting that we’ve broadly felt this way since the inception of our organization, but we believe that the additional resources we’re allocating (40% of ourbudgetis now R&D) and expertise we’re investing in (e.g. the hiring of Dr. Monaghan) indicate that we are now better suited to actually build this evidence base.","text",8
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-2023","Significant monitoring efforts for less payoff: Under our current model, we have to conduct a large number of monitoring visits to identify issues—for instance, one analysis we did in June found that only ~1% of our farm visits ended up in us sufficiently helping fish to count them in our impact numbers. This limits our cost-effectiveness.","text",9
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-2023","Linear scalability: Right now, as we regularly visit every farm we work with, our staff size and equipment inventory needs to scale linearly with new farms added. We’ve come to think that this is unlikely to be cost effective at larger scales. Unclear sustainability: We would ideally like to change the aquaculture industry such that, if FWI was to pull out, there would be some lasting changes. It seems unlikely that our current program does that. By increasing the focus on identifying improved theories of change in both our research (R&D) and implementation (ARA) departments, in 2024 we plan to develop programs that address these limitations. A Note on Frequent Pivots To our more closely-following supporters, and especially to our team, it is probably evident that FWI has pivoted its strategy a lot in the four years of our existence. For instance,eachofthesepostsall represent major pivots the organization has made. Even though we believe most of these pivots were well-warranted, making them so frequently has sometimes been challenging, both for our external collaborators as well as for our staff. Why have we made such frequent pivots? The following factors have likely contributed: Startup charitiesprobably shouldpivot frequently as they hone in on the optimal strategy. This especially applies to charities working in novel areas, and FWI works at the intersection of about three novel areas: Indian major carp welfare, working with farmers, and working in India and China. We believe that our decision-makers (particularly Tom and myself, Haven) were somewhat naive in our assessments ofa)the evidence base,b)what would work, andc)how long it would take to work. Will FWI continue to pivot as frequently going forwards? Though we shouldn’t neglect the base rate here of our past pivot frequency, we do believe there are good reasons now to indicate that we have settled upon a somewhat more stable long-term strategy.","text",10
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-2023","These reasons include our team having much more experience now than before, and also having more experts on the team.","text",11
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-2023","The big pivot we do expect to make in the next year or two is that of identifying a new promising program and then scaling it up. In the meantime, we hope that the broader pro-animal movement can find value in learning from our efforts in this particularly novel project. We’re Now Fundraising As usual, all of the above will just remain ideas until we implement them—and to do that, we first need funding. Specifically, we’re now seeking to raise a remaining $650,000 to cover thecostsof our 2024 planned work.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/we-visited-wet-markets-in-three-different-countries-here-s-what-we-saw","We visited wet markets in three different countries. Here’s what we saw. Updated:Mar 21 Beyond their risks for spreading disease, wet markets also have nonexistent welfare standards for the animals being sold in them. As the world faces a global pandemic, more attention has been placed on wet markets. Why? Health officials and other experts believe that the new coronavirusoriginated at a wet market in Wuhan, China. As leaders scramble to secure supplies and enforce social distancing, they’re also considering how to fight against future viruses from spreading. Wet markets have become a focus of that fight. We’ve had the opportunity to visit wet markets around the world, including India, Thailand, and Vietnam. We’ve seen the conditions of wet markets and the welfare of the animals inside them, and want to give you a firsthand look into what they’re like. What is a wet market? According to Vox, the definition of a wet market is broad. Generally, a wet market is a place where fresh meat, fish, produce, and other perishable goods are sold, as distinguished from ""dry markets"" that sell durable goods such as fabric and electronics. In China specifically, there are some wet markets that sell only slaughtered animals and produce; some that sell commonly eaten live animals like chickens; and some that sell wild animals like bats. The wet market in Wuhan where the virus likely originated had a wildlife section – where animals such as live snakes, beavers, badgers, foxes, peacocks, and porcupines (among others) were for sale. The wet markets we visited had live fish, chickens, and other animals like goats and ducks for sale. There is some zoonotic risk anytime live animals are kept in close quarters, but wet markets that sell wild animalspose a particularly higher risk for the spread of viruses like COVID-19due to their cramped quarters, unsanitary practices, and the proximity of wild animals that would never be near one another in a natural setting.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/we-visited-wet-markets-in-three-different-countries-here-s-what-we-saw","Stress & pain for fish The welfare issues for fish begin on their journey to the markets. In India, fish are taken by truck from farms to markets, held in crates with some ice. The journey can often last hours. Some of the fish die of asphyxiation on the journey to the market, while others stay alive, struggling to breathe. The ones that survive the journey often have a worse fate: they are crowded in small buckets, with or without water, then left out in the open air for prolonged periods before they die. The fish that are still alive are usually slaughtered by having their gills slit and bleeding out. In certain regions fish are deliberately kept alive through asomewhat isolated but particularlycruel practice called “fish binding” – a practice where fish are stretched into a bent shape and tied in place with a piece of twine attached from the fish’s mouth to tail. The practice keeps the fish alive and breathing much longer than if they were lying flat.","text",4

Photo by Jo-Anne McArthur / We Animals In our visit to Thailand, we observed somepercussive stunningof fish, which is a more humane way to render fish unconscious before slaughter. We hope to see more wet markets practice this kind of stunning before fish are slaughtered. Mistreatment of animals goes beyond fish Though welfare standards for fish at wet markets are nonexistent, fish aren’t the only animals mistreated at the markets. Many animals are kept in extremely cramped conditions for days, sometimes in more crowded cages than in factory farms. During our visits, we saw frogs who had been skinned alive in Vietnam, and a duck defeathered alive in Thailand. In India, we saw chickens have their throats slit and then be tossed in a pen with other dying chickens, bleeding out.","text",6

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/we-visited-wet-markets-in-three-different-countries-here-s-what-we-saw","What’s the solution? For the sake of the welfare of animals sold at wet markets, as well as the risk the markets create for the spread of disease –the selling of live animals at wet markets should be banned universally. While the Chinese government has banned the sale of wildlife at markets, some high-level officials such as Dr Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, havecalled for the ban of wet marketsentirely. Banning the sale of live animals at wet markets would undoubtedly disrupt the livelihoods and traditions of many people, as is frustratingly often the case when pushing for systemic change. As Peter Singer writesin an op-ed for Project Syndicate, to ban wet markets entirely, we will have to overcome cultural preferences, as well as the economic hardship for those making a living from the markets. But even without giving animals the moral consideration they deserve, Singer says, the risk of frequent global epidemics that wet markets pose decisively outweigh these concerns. As we work for a better world for everyone, human and otherwise, these are serious costs we must consider, and through our innovation we seek to overcome them. A better world for all During our visit in India, we spoke with a man whose job was selling fish at a wet market. During our conversation, we asked him what he wanted for his children’s careers. He told us: not this. He wanted something better for his family. Ultimately, we share his vision for a better life for wet market workers, their families, and the thousands of fish and other animals slaughtered at wet markets every day. Recent Posts","text",8

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/livelihood-orgs","Livelihood Organizations as a Scaling Mechanism and our Ongoing Project with DVARA By Abhishek Pandey, Fish Welfare Initiative Associate Director, India Summary While FWI has made significant strides improving our interventions over the years, we’ve yet to validate an intervention that is sufficiently scalable. That’s why we’rededicatinga substantial portion of our resources in 2024 to researching and testing more interventions and scaling mechanisms. One promising scaling mechanism is integrating our interventions into the services of existing livelihood-focused organizations, known as ""livelihood organizations."" This post delves into the benefits of this approach. To evaluate the approach further, FWI entered into a partnership with one such livelihood organization,DVARA, in May of 2024. Through this partnership, we'll work together to train DVARA’s staff to enroll farmers and analyze water quality samples. These samples will be analyzed at a lab supported by FWI, and, based on the results, DVARA’s staff will provide farmers with corrective actions. We discuss this partnership and project in more detail towards the end of this post. As always, wewelcomeyour input.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/livelihood-orgs","The Benefits of Collaborating With Livelihood Organizations Livelihood organizations work to improve the living conditions of marginalized (human) communities. They do this by providing their beneficiaries with resources, training, and support in order to advance their economic stability. As FWI considers various mechanisms for scaling fish welfare interventions, we are considering partnering with these organizations to include fish welfare in the programs they deliver to the many farmers they reach. There are benefits to this approach—this post discusses several of them: Coupling animal welfare with more holistic societal benefits Tapping into networks of established ground mobilizers Utilizing established government connections Benefit 1: Coupling animal welfare with more holistic societal benefits One significant advantage of collaborating with livelihood organizations is that they allow us to integrate animal welfare programs into broader development issues. In the development sector, priorities such as employment, poverty, and gender inequality are often at the forefront. By partnering with these organizations, we can align our animal welfare goals with these critical issues, making our cause more relevant. Additionally, animal welfare is sometimes seen as an elitist concern in India, one that is primarily championed by the privileged. By working with livelihood organizations, who work directly on behalf of marginalized communities, we can address this perception and make the case for animal welfare as an important component of sustainable livelihoods. This collaboration helps us gain broader acceptance and support for our programs, positioning animal welfare in a more inclusive and practical context. Benefit 2: Tapping into networks of established ground mobilizers Livelihood organizations bring with them an established ground network and experienced mobilizers who understand the local context.","text",4
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/livelihood-orgs","This existing infrastructure is valuable for the implementation of welfare programs, as it can reduce the cost and time associated with community mobilization.","text",5
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/livelihood-orgs","Additionally, the expertise of these organizations helps ensure that interventions are culturally appropriate and well-received. By leveraging their insights and experience, our projects can potentially achieve longer-lasting and more impactful benefits. Benefit 3: Utilizing established government connections Livelihood organizations often have well-established connections with government bodies. For example, DVARA, a prominent livelihood organization (and our now partner—see below), has significant experience working with government entities in Odisha, Manipur, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, and other Indian states. These connections can be critical for our animal welfare programs, as government partnerships can lead to better policy advocacy, increased funding opportunities, and more effective implementation of our programs. Government funding is another important aspect of these connections, as such funding provides not only financial resources but also legitimacy and access to on-ground support. This support helps in the implementation of projects and in gaining the trust and cooperation of local communities. Additionally, government funding often includes monitoring and evaluation mechanisms that ensure effective use of resources, increasing the overall success of our programs. FWI’s Ongoing Project with DVARA in Odisha Given the benefits, we were interested in exploring partnering with a livelihood organization further. The partner we selected wasDVARA, a financial services company which uses technology-driven solutions to increase financial inclusion in India. On one level, the aim of our partnership with DVARA is to expand our programs to a new state (Odisha) and improve the welfare of farmed fishes there.","text",6
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/livelihood-orgs","On a deeper level, the aim of this partnership is to assess whether this model—a livelihood organization implementing a fish welfare intervention with our technical and financial assistance as part of their broader portfolio of projects—is promising to pursue further.","text",7

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/livelihood-orgs","The project with DVARA involves four phases: Phase 1: Intervention Selection: The first, already-completed phase involved field visits to assess the needs of fish farmers in various districts of Odisha. In these visits, FWI and DVARA teams identified water quality testing as the primary intervention. Stakeholder consent was obtained to define roles and responsibilities, with FWI providing technical guidance and DVARA handling on-ground implementation. Phase 2: Technician Training & Lab Setup: The second phase focuses on setting up the water quality testing lab and training the technicians selected among DVARA staff. At this post’s publication, the equipment procurement is in process and training is to be conducted shortly. We expect to inaugurate the small lab required for this project at the end of June. Phase 3: Project Implementation & Sample Collection: In this phase, the goal is to enroll at least 10 farmers to drop off water samples regularly. This phase tests farmer interest and engagement (a key variable), with DVARA taking the lead in managing sample collection and follow-ups. We expect this stage to last several months. Phase 4: Project Evaluation: The final phase involves evaluating the project's success by monitoring the project throughout the implementation phase. The project report will be compiled, and the promise of this approach assessed. At this point, FWI will make a determination about whether to abort, continue, or scale the project. This determination will be made by the end of the year. This project is one of our more experimental ones, but we are hopeful that it will yield positive results and illuminate an additional mechanism of scaling welfare interventions to improve fish welfare across India. We will keep you posted on our progress. Recent Posts","text",9

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/rnd-plans-2024","Our 2024 Research & Development Plans for India Note: This post discusses in further detail the work that our R&D Department will be doing in 2024, which is part of a broader strategic change to seek to identify improved welfare interventions for helping fishes in India. For more higher-level information about this change and why we’re making it, seeour postfrom November. In 2023, we made the decision to establish a new department: the Research & Development Department. This post outlines how this department was formed, as well as its plans for 2024. Specifically, it discusses thekey resultswe have set for ourselves in 2024, including running several studies and the development of a welfare assessment protocol for Indian major carp. We plan to publish a specific list of studies we plan to run in 2024 to identify improved interventions in January. Formation of FWI’s R&D Department It has always been our goal to learn fromthe bestof the evidence-based global health space, and to apply that to interventions that help nonhuman animals. In particular, we aim to make FWI’s interventions evidence-based, and to utilize evidence to design cost-effective programs that demonstrably improve the lives of fishes at scale. Aligned with this ambition, in September 2023 we made the decision to establish a new R&D Department. The R&D Department was born out of the previous Welfare Standard (WS) Department, which had focused on developing welfare standards for farmers in our farmer program, theAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture(ARA), to implement. In essence, the ARA and the WS departments were two sides of the same coin—the WS Department developed standards and corrective actions for farmers to follow, while the ARA engaged with farmers, collected data, and communicated recommended corrective actions to farmers when required.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/rnd-plans-2024","In creating the new R&D Department we are effectively decoupling our research entity from the ARA, broadening our research mandate to explore alternative programs, not just welfare improvements for our current farmer program (the ARA). We also discuss this, and the reasons for it, in ourrecent strategy post.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/rnd-plans-2024","The stated overall objective of our new R&D Department is todevelop new theories of change and to conduct studies to inform FWI programs to improve the lives of fishes.In designing studies to inform new or improved programs, the R&D Department considers the potential for scale from the outset, along with perceived level of impact. Careful consideration is given to cost-effectiveness and likelihood of buy-in from the key stakeholders: farmers. Any intervention that FWI rolls out in the future must be inexpensive, easy-to-apply, and be perceived by farmers as beneficial if they are to implement it. The newly-established R&D Department is led by Dr. Paul Monaghan, who joined FWI in July. Paul comes to FWI with extensive experience managing large-scale, multi-stakeholder, multi-year, multimillion-dollar public health programs. Paul's experience includes setting and driving strategic direction, spearheading delivery of program outputs to achieve long-term impact, and serving as technical advisor to NGO and government partners to ensure programs and their constituent components are of high quality and achieving the greatest impact with cost-effectiveness, scalability, and sustainability in mind. Evidence-based decision-making has been central to the programs Paul has led, and he has extensive experience with designing and overseeing large-scale research studies and impact evaluations, and programmatic monitoring and evaluation.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/rnd-plans-2024","R&D Department Plans for 2024 As perFWI's objectives and key results for 2024, the key objective for the R&D Department in 2024 is to “Conduct studies and exploratory programs to inform future programs to scale”. Aligned with this objective, the following key results (KR’s) have been set for 2024: KR 2.1:1 study completed to inform new strategies to improve fish welfare. KR 2.2: 1 study completed to inform viable strategies for cost-effective scale-up of ARA. KR 2.3: 1 exploratory program initiated and undergoing monitoring to inform decisions around scale-up. KR 2.4: 1 welfare assessment protocol developed and ready to use as a key monitoring and evaluation tool. Work conducted as part of KR 2.1 and KR 2.3 helps to inform new programs, with the potential for scale considered from the outset. For KR 2.1, studies will help inform decisions about potential programs (or components of programs) we could consider rolling out in the future. KR 2.3 is almost a “flipped” version of this – we will initiate an exploratory program on a small scale, which we will study to inform if it’s worthwhile expanding in the future. Work conducted as part of KR 2.2 helps to inform strategies for scaling our existing program (i.e. the ARA). Any ARA-related study that the R&D Department conducts as part of KR 2.2 will be directly related to changing the model such that the ARA is considered more scalable. This differs from work that the ARA will do as part of their own KR 3.3 (“strategies tested to improve existing ARA program”), which will focus on improving the current model, but not from the scalability perspective (refer to ourrecent blog from Novemberto see how the ARA intends to place greater focus on innovation in 2024).

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/rnd-plans-2024","We are currently conducting exploratory work to understand which of these ideas we should prioritize.  We will publish more about our specific plans early in 2024, and commit to sharing regular progress updates throughout the year.","text",7
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/rnd-plans-2024","All studies and exploratory programs conducted under KRs 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are intended to either directly improve the lives of fishes (exploratory programs) or provide information about interventions we could roll out in the future to improve the lives of fishes (studies). Work conducted as part of KR 2.4 would not directly improve the lives of fishes; rather, it would allow us to better understand if our programming is actually improving the lives of fishes. Currently, FWI uses water quality parameters as a proxy for fish welfare, with the assumption being that if water quality is poor, fishes suffer. Having a welfare assessment protocol would allow us to (i) understand welfare needs more objectively, and (ii) more objectively assess our impact.","text",8

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/rnd-plans-2024","The idea is to create a welfare assessment protocol that is practical, feasible and inexpensive, and to utilize this at all farms. For new farms that FWI may approach in the future, this welfare assessment would be conducted before we commit to supporting the farmer, helping us to more objectively understand to what extent welfare is a concern at the given farm. This could be important for improving FWI’s impact and cost-effectiveness—we can’t have an impact at farms at which welfare issues are not addressable by us, so resources should be prioritized towards farms where issues a) are severe, and b) are solvable. For farms already supported by the ARA (or any other future program) this welfare assessment could be conducted periodically to assess progress. Given the key purpose for this welfare assessment protocol – to assess all farms periodically so we can assess impact over time – it’s critical that the protocol is considered feasible to conduct at scale, practical to be conducted by non-technical personnel, inexpensive on a farm-by-farm basis, and sufficiently informative to help FWI with decision-making. We’re hopeful that these plans, coupled with the increased level of rigor we believe we are now able to execute them with, will make 2024 our most promising year yet for developing cost effective interventions to improve farmed fish welfare.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/fish-welfare-initiative-and-aquatic-life-institute","Collaboration between Fish Welfare Initiative and Aquatic Life Institute Updated:Jun 9, 2020 This blog post is a summary of a post we wrote on the Effective Altruism Forum. Seefull post here. Written by William Bench, Tom Billington, Haven King-Nobles, & Rocky Schwartz Likely over100 billion fishare farmed globally each year. Severaltrillion more fishare caught from the wild annually. These numbers are staggering and represent the enormous scale of suffering that these industries produce. Recently, two EA-aligned organizations have been created with the sole focus of improving the lives of aquatic species:The Aquatic Life Institute(ALI) and Fish Welfare Initiative (FWI). We (both The Aquatic Life Institute and Fish Welfare Initiative) believe that the suffering of fish presents a massively overlooked and important area for effective altruism. Thus, we believe that the two organizations and their respective approaches are complementary – where FWI takes a “bottom-up” approach, working with producers at a micro level and then scaling to macro level interventions, ALI takes a “top-down” approach, lobbying decision-makers as a means of impacting producers. Recognizing that approximately543 species of aquatic animals are farmedand these species have dramatically different welfare considerations, both organizations seek to increase species-specific research in order to reduce suffering on fish farms.The Aquatic Life Institute achieves this through pushing better welfare to leverage groups in highly-tractable countries (such as certification groups in Europe and North America). Fish Welfare Initiative achieves this through building interest for welfare at the producer level in high-scale and highly-neglected countries (e.g. India).","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/fish-welfare-initiative-and-aquatic-life-institute","We believe there is ample room for two complementary organizations in this space, and we in fact hope to see many more organizations coordinating into a fish welfare movement (similar to the collaborative work seen for chickens in the last years, see theOpen Wing Alliance).In the months ahead, you can expect to see continued collaboration between ALI and FWI. The two organizations are in regular communication and actively working to share resources where needed.","text",3

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/aquaculture-in-asian-countries","Aquaculture in Asian Countries By Jennifer-Justine Kirsch and Marco Cerqueira In the past few decades, several Asian countries have risen to become the largest finfish producers worldwide. In 2018, almost 90% of all commodified fish came from Asian countries, with China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Bangladesh dominating the global market. Today, production is growing fast, and this adds a wide range of welfare problems. Tapping into existing challenges and a dynamic industry, now is an important time to explore high-leverage opportunities for fish welfare work in this region. This report will give an overview of aquaculture in Asian countries and discuss the opportunities and challenges of fish welfare work with a focus on South, East, and Southeast Asia. The issues raised here require urgent action and shared responsibility. They also require the consideration of complex interactions between cultural beliefs, the international fish trade, fish consumption, institutional politics, and farmers' awareness of fish welfare. There is no single Asian country that is most promising for fish welfare work. Rather, they all have opportunity for and constraints to impactful work. But with 73 to 180 billion fish alive on farms right now and even more in the future, effective work in any of these top-producing countries could affect billions of lives.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/international-work","Our international (non-India) work in 2021 This post summarizes our projects to help fish in countries other than India, our current main program. FWI’s international work is enabled by local team members and volunteers who explore opportunities to improve fishes’ lives—we are grateful for their dedication. Focus and exploration We believe that a strong focus helps us achieve more impact. Thus, 85% of our work focuses onhelping farmed fish in India. However, fish welfare is a developing field, and we don’t fully understand the opportunities and challenges present in other countries yet. These could have low-hanging fruit—easily implemented projects, partners who want to work on fish welfare, or local talent ready for fish advocacy work. As such, we spend the remaining 15% of our staff time and energy on international (i.e., non-India) projects focused on one or all of the following goals. Help fishby finding and taking up low-hanging fruit (i.e., easily implementable opportunities). Build the fish advocacy movementthrough evaluating less-represented countries and setting up relationships for future local programs. Build capacityby nurturing local talent. Exploredifferent approaches and systems. Our international projects In the past 1.5 years, we ran projects in China, the Philippines, and the UK. We also explored fish welfare inRecirculatory Aquaculture Systemsand collaborated with an aquaculture research station in Portugal. China Projects: Our China Scoping Contractor, Isla Gibson, conducted initialscoping workin late 2020. In April 2021, we hired our China Specialist, Lu Chen, to explore opportunities for farmed fish in China. She has since built a considerable network of partners and stakeholders. Achievements: We published theChina scoping reportin December 2020. In May 2021, the International Cooperation Committee of Animal Welfare (ICCAW) invited FWI to host the first aquatic animal welfare forum at the World Conference for Farmed Animal Welfare (WCFAW).","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/international-work","2022 Plans: COVID-19 safety guidelines permitting, we will host the aquatic animal welfare forum at the WCFAW. We also intend to formalize 1- and 3-year plans for working in China, look into the policy opportunities for fish welfare, and meet 12 new aquaculture stakeholders. We are considering a 2-3 month field visit in China if COVID-19 guidelines allow travel. Philippines Projects: Our Philippines Scoping Contractor, Ethel Wagas, firstexplored opportunitiesto help fish in the Philippines in 2020. In 2021, we hired two Philippines Specialist Interns, Chiawen Chiang and Sophia Tabanao, who built relationships with animal welfare advocates, environmental organizations, and fish farmers. Chiawen, Sophia, and Olivia Webb, a local volunteer, explored several avenues of impact and involved three further volunteers in their projects. This local arm of FWI operates under the nameMakaisda. Achievements: We published thePhilippines scoping reportin December 2020. In 2021, Makaisda met with nonprofit and industry stakeholders to understand the aquaculture landscape in the Philippines. They also connected with four fish farmers to plan a future pilot study and organized awebinar on fish welfare. To facilitate future fish advocacy work in the Philippines, Makaisda runs atalent database. 2022 Plans: Makaisda plans to implement welfare improvements with two farms, explore the possibility of fish welfare training modules in collaboration with the government, and scout out new talent.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/international-work","A fish pond in Ayungon -- one of the areas we visited during our scoping work in the Philippines. United Kingdom Projects: We assisted the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation (CAWF) in launching their fish welfare campaign. This project was policy-focused and aimed at achieving legal protection for aquatic animals. Achievements: Publication of theCAWF: Fish Welfare Reportand theCAWF: Fish Sentience Briefing. Both sparked a public conversation around the treatment of aquatic animals in the UK (e.g., seehere), and the welfare report has even made its way into theFrench Reference Centre for Animal Welfare. The CAWF has since been in contact with policy stakeholders to encourage aquatic animal welfare legislation. 2022 Plans: We will continue to be in touch with CAWF and assist them with their campaign as needed. Portugal: On-Farm Consultation Projects: Throughout 2021, our Fish Welfare Specialist, Dr. Cerqueira, visited the Portuguese Aquaculture Experimental Station (EPPO, Olhão) to exploreopportunities to improve fish welfarein EPPO’s ten fish ponds containing seabream, seabass, meagre, and white seabream. Dr. Cerqueira recommended a set of interventions (seehere) that staff at EPPO readily implemented. Achievements: The successfully implemented welfare interventions likely improved the lives of all 56,296 fish on this farm. We expect EPPO staff to continue implementing these changes and thus improve the lives of more fish in future production cycles. 2022 Plans: We will continue monitoring the condition of the fish at EPPO and assist with implementing our recommendations when necessary.","text",6

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/new-strategy-updates","New Strategy Updates Updated:Mar 23, 2020 COVID-19 Update on March 23, 2020:Before the WHO declared coronavirus to be a pandemic, we had been conducting farm visits in India to assess the potential for welfare improvements. However, as with many other things, this is no longer prudent. We will thus be postponing our country scoping work indefinitely until we deem it safe to continue. This will likely take several months. This is not a decision we came to lightly, as it means that most of our future plans outlined below must also be delayed. In the meantime, we will continue researching the most promising welfare improvements for fish. We will continue posting on Facebook and our blog. And as we work remotely and practice social distancing, we will continue to do all we can to promote the welfare of fish. Fish Welfare Initiative has been operating for eight months now. During this time, we have written multiple organizational plans, conducted scoping work in different countries, and learned significantly more about the nuances involved with improving fish welfare. Through this process, we are now more confident than ever in our broad organizational strategy for the next three years: Stage 1: Research and Setup July 2019 - June 2020 This is the stage we are currently in. It involves 1) setting up the organization (registering, building the right team, initial fundraising), and 2) conducting initial research to shape our future intervention. This research has involved providing preliminary answers to four questions: Which are the most promisingspeciesto work on? Which is the most promisingcountryto work in? What are the most promisingwelfare improvementsto be made for farmed fish? What is the most promisingapproachto take? By “approach”, we mean either corporate outreach, governmental outreach, providing direct training, etc.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/new-strategy-updates","We are interested to receive input from various stakeholders on the ground (both NGOs and industry) regarding what approach allows us to have the biggest impact.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/new-strategy-updates","As of March 2020, we are midway through producing scoping reports on the most promising countries (see ourVietnam report) and have completed ourapproach research. We hired a Fish Welfare Specialist,Marco Cerquiera, to lead the welfare improvements research and assist with the species research. Stage 2: Micro Level - Pilot Program June 2020 - early 2021 After having completed our initial research, we will be in a position to set up an office in our country of implementation. This will most likely be in South or Southeast Asia. One crucial bottleneck may be finding the right person (i.e. future Managing Director) who can lead our in-country operations.We will begin hiring for this position shortly and encourage interested parties from these regions tocontact us. We will then work collaboratively with 1-4 producers to implement welfare improvement(s) on their facility, as informed by our research. The primary purpose of this is to gain a proof of concept that can be scaled up later. For instance, if it looks most promising to work on improving water quality in India, we will work with a couple of producers on improving water quality management. We will then draw from this experience and our findings to potentially work with the government on improving respective policies. Depending on the success of the initial pilot, we may need to pivot one or multiple times before proceeding to scale. We aim to follow a model ofvalidated learning. Stage 3: Scale to Macro Level - Governmental or Corporate Outreach 2021 onwards Improved welfare in a few facilities will not be sufficient to justify the costs incurred to run FWI. Rather, cost-effectiveness will come at scale: by working with corporations and/or governments to scale up the improvements we will have tested in the pilot. This third stage is less certain, and will greatly depend on the country we choose to work in. Stage 3 is the primary stage we expect FWI to exist in over the duration of its life.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/fipola","Fipola’s Vice President, Sunil Tandon, and Fish Welfare Initiative India Foundation’s Managing Director, Karthik Pulugurtha, posing for a photo after signing the MoU In a first-of-its-kind initiative,Fipolaentered into aMemorandum of Understandingwith our India team to include fish welfare in its procurement policy. The startup meat retail corporation launched into India’s unorganized meat sector in 2016 with its ‘farm-to-fork’ model to ease consumer concerns over quality, hygiene, and availability. With the signing of this agreement, Fipola is paving the way to further incorporate kinder practices into the sector by leading the introduction of higher welfare fish products in the Indian market. By the terms of the MoU, we will join Fipola in its endeavor to create a safer and kinder fish supply chain and take on an advisory position with its suppliers. The corporation will also conduct a transition trial to shift part of its procurement to higher welfare fish this year. What does Fipola’s MoU with FWI India mean for farmed fishes in India? Introducing higher welfare fish is a novel undertaking in the Indian market. We believe it has the potential to shine a light on the largely neglected issues related to fish welfare. It will also be the first scalable step toward reducing fish suffering by transitioning corporate procurement towards fishes farmed with higher welfare practices. Additionally, it will allow us to build awareness of fish welfare issues among consumers. Improved welfare benefits not only fish but also farmers, corporations, consumers, and the environment. We believe this MoU is the foundation for driving procurement transitions toward the producer members of theAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture, who are already implementing higher welfare measures. On the corporate side, European companies like Mowi and Bluegrove have set a precedent for prioritizing fish welfare in production.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/fipola","European companies like Mowi and Bluegrove increasingly understand the importance of fish welfare to production. We’ve seen that Indian farmers and corporations also have tremendous potential to do this. What does Fipola’s MoU with FWI India mean for Consumers? In addition to shedding light on the plight of farmed fish in India, this MoU also benefits consumers. We believe this will play a key role in driving demand for products that prioritize animal welfare. Some benefits for consumers include: Fish products that are a result of prioritizing animal welfare. Higher quality fish raised in hygienic conditions. Reduced exposure to antibiotics (which can otherwise cause antibiotic resistance) that are traditionally used to keep fish healthy. Our signing of the MoU with Fipola followed our first corporate roundtable event,The Alliance for Responsible Aquaculture: Roundtable Dialogue on Fish Welfare. To learn more, see the fullMoU. Fish welfare can only move forward when all stones are turned. This is what makes corporations, who deal in millions of fish lives every day, key stakeholders for welfare. With modern-day retailers like Fipola recognizing the importance of welfare, we are confident more corporations will follow suit. Recent Posts","text",7

Corporate engagement is a key part of FWI’stheory of change. The initial phases of our work on this end involved scoping seafood markets, fish retailers, and culinary experts. We met with 35 corporations and established relationship foundations. Hosting a roundtable event to initiate a dialogue between theAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture(ARA) and promising corporations followed as the most natural next step. Our 3 main goals for the event were: To further engage corporate and culinary stakeholders with the concept of fish welfare. To increase the likelihood of traceability of and future industry market linkages for higher welfare fish. To create positive press about fish welfare for general awareness. We believe corporate interest in fish welfare has immense potential to motivate more aquafarmers to implement it. Corporations in India also stand to gain from incorporating welfare into their policies. To this end, we invited ARA farmers and representatives from Indian meat retail giants,Fipola;Captain Fresh; andFalcon Marine Group, to attend the roundtable dialogue. Culinary experts also attended and shared their perspectives on fish welfare in relation to the food industry.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/jan-culture-survey","Our Latest Culture Survey Results This post shares the results of our latest quarterly culture surveys conducted in October 2022 and January 2023. We publish the results of these surveys primarily as part of our commitment to being a transparent organization. Going forward we intend to continue publishing the results, regardless of how favorable they may be, on an annual basis. You can access the original responses to the two quarterly surveyshereandhere. You can also read about ourprevious culture surveyfrom June 2022. Note also that there is likely some positivity bias here, as our staff knows that the leadership will read them and publish the results. Summary Broadly, we believe the results from these surveys show that FWI has a strongly positive culture. Our staff particularly noted that FWI’s culture is impact-driven and transparent, and reported that the culture and the people were one of their favorite reasons for working at FWI. There are however, still areas where our culture and working environment likely should be improved, including reducing overworking, improving the leadership’s team understanding of the ground realities, and creating a greater sense of connection to the mission. We address how we aim to improve on these issues below. If you have suggestions for how we can do better, we encourage you to comment below or contact us. What We Are Doing Well Our team members note having been consistently happy with working with their fellow colleagues. There were several responses that highlighted FWI's fun, collaborative, and supportive working environment. Similarly, our focus on high impact and making a significant improvement to the lives of farmed fishes was seen as a strong positive.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/jan-culture-survey","Here are some of the responses when our team was asked how they would describe FWI’s work culture: Compared to our previous culture survey fromJune 2022, there was a decrease in concerns related to overworking and rushing. However, these issues were not completely eliminated, as described in detail inAreas for Improvement. We see this improvement as a sign of growth and will continue to better ourselves to be more supportive and understanding of our team. Our team seemed generally happy with pay and the current feedback culture. There was also an overall appreciation of our transparency and an environment that encourages self-development and autonomy. Responses on this point included: We will work toward consistently maintaining these strengths as FWI continues to grow in size and impact. Areas For Improvement One of the core parts of FWI’s culture is its emphasis on self-improvement: We are constantly thinking about ways we can get better and the culture survey helps us identify where we have most room to improve.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/jan-culture-survey","The following are the main areas that have been highlighted in the two surveys as areas for improvement. Note that some of our ways of addressing these problems are unlikely to fully solve them, at least to the extent where none of our staff ever note them as issues in future culture surveys. We think that is ok, largely because a) building new systems to address issues itself takes time and can cause other issues, and b) we think it makes sense for the resource-intensiveness of the solution to be proportional to the severity of the issue, and fortunately none of the issues below were reported as being too severe. 1. Long hours/overworking. This has consistently been something that some of our staff have noted as an issue, and these surveys proved no exception (though better than normal, see above). 4 of 18 respondents in October noted this as one of the things they liked the least about working at FWI, while 4 of the 20 respondents in January said the same. How we are addressing it: We have reminded the team and particularly managers to be mindful of this issue, especially when setting goals. We realize that this probably won’t be adequate to solve the problem in all cases though, and to some extent we expect some long hours are an inevitable byproduct of having a fast-paced, goal-oriented, and strongly mission-driven culture. 2. Leadership does not understand ground realities enough. Several people noted this, and it is another issue that often comes up. This is a particularly important issue to get right, as all ofFWI’s impactis generated by our work on the ground with farmers. How we are addressing it: Some of the leadership team will be spending more time in the field going forwards. We are also going to begin inviting 1 rotating non-leadership staff to each monthly leadership mini-re-evaluation meeting. 3. Inadequate benefits. 40% of our staff noted in our January survey that better benefits would make their jobs more fulfilling.","text",6
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/jan-culture-survey","How we are addressing it: Our Managing Director for India is currently talking with a few of our India staff team to understand what increased benefits they would like, to then understand how valued these would be and whether they would make sense to add to the budget.","text",7
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/jan-culture-survey","4. Responsibilities should be more clearly defined. In both the October and the January surveys, this was one of top 3 things our staff noted that would make their jobs more fulfilling. How we are addressing it: We are reminding our managers to consider further defining their respective team’s responsibilities. We are also encouraging all of our team to speak with their manager if they would like more clearly defined roles. 5. Insufficient team social activities. This was one of the top 3 things that our team in the October survey noted as something that would make their job more fulfilling, though relatively fewer people noted it as such in the January survey. How we are addressing it: We are planning quarterly semi-local weekend retreats, where we will spend one day on work-related and the following day on social activities. We are also considering hosting more (optional) social events in the evening. 6. Some respondents would like the ability to work more remotely. Much of our work takes place in Andhra Pradesh, India, and depending on peoples’ roles we require that they live there for various amounts of the year. How we are addressing it: Unfortunately, we believe in-person work is a core requirement for us to achieve the sort of impact we intend to achieve and be the sort of organization we intend to be, so we are not going to change anything here. We will continue trying to clearly assess where people are needed in-person and where they aren’t, and informing them that they can work remotely where it makes sense. Other Issues","text",8

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/jan-culture-survey","The following are the other issues mentioned that we believe are somewhat less important to tackle, but those we will still be working to address: The team should feel more connected to the mission. Our work is too siloed. We have too much top-down decision-making. We will be addressing these through a combination of changing the content we discuss in some of our regular meetings, ensuring our managers are mindful of these issues, and implementing a ground team shadowing program. If you have suggestions for how we can improve on any of the above, feel free to comment below orcontact us. Thanks for your interest in our organization! Recent Posts","text",10

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/wcfaw","Aquatic Animal Welfare in China Updated:May 27, 2022 There is likely no more significant country in the world for fish welfare than China: Its aquaculture industry is home toover 65%of worldwide production, and its global influence isever increasing. For these reasons, FWI explored thepotential for fish welfare work in Chinaback in 2020. We have now begun the next stage of our work in China, launched by our recent co-hosting of the first-ever Aquatic Animal Welfare Forum at the World Conference on Farm Animal Welfare (WCFAW). The online conference took place in April and included attendees from industry, nonprofits, academia, and government. As this conference is organized byICCAW, a Chinese organization with very close ties to the Chinese government, we believe the precedent set and relationships built will pave the way to enable China’s future leadership role in the field of fish welfare internationally.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/wcfaw","The Aquatic Animal Forum’s opening speech at the World Conference for Farm Animal Welfare. About the World Conference on Farm Animal Welfare The WCFAW is an annual event hosted by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the China Association for the Promotion of International Agricultural Cooperation (CAPIAC). The conference features various forums on farmed animals, including chickens, pigs, donkeys, cattle, dairy cows, sheep, and horses. Each of these is hosted by a partner organization. In the past, partners have included the RSPCA, Compassion in World Farming, and World Animal Protection, among others. Last year, the event organizer, the International Cooperation Committee on Animal Welfare (ICCAW), invited us to expand its program by adding an Aquatic Animal Welfare Forum. Adding a Forum on aquatic animals was an urgent matter given the increasing importance of fish welfare worldwide and that over65% of worldwideaquaculture production occurs in China.Seeking local support, we invited Prof. Lv, from the Shanghai Ocean University and the RSPCA as our co-hosts. Setting the Stage While welfare for terrestrial farmed animals is increasinglybecoming part of industry discussionsin China, the welfare of aquatic animals has yet to enter the scientific and industry discourse. We think that this Forum was a crucial step in bringing aquatic animals to the table and raising concerns over their current welfare state. In preparation for the conference, we collaborated with ICCAW to publish several articles introducing the concept of aquatic animal welfare. The articles were published on ICCAW's and their partner organizations’ social media platforms. We expect that circulating these helped introduce the topic of aquatic animal welfare to academics and the broader public.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/wcfaw","An excerpt of the five aquatic animal welfare pillars as detailed in our publication inPopular Science(translated by Google Translate). Finding a Common Language We hosted anumber of Chinese and international experts, including the FAO Senior Fisheries Officer, the President of the Chinese Fisheries Society, the Director-General of the Network of Asia-Pacific Aquaculture Centres (NACA), and the Executive Director of FAI Farms. The Forum sessions covered a variety of topics including: Current status, challenges, and opportunities of global aquaculture Recommendations for aquatic animal welfare in international standards Production benefits of improving aquatic animal welfare Impacts of aquaculture noise on industrialized aquaculture organisms Bringing best practices and animal welfare to aquatic systems: The example of tilapia in Brazil The Forum concluded with a panel discussion including all the Chinese speakers and moderated by associate professor Wen Zhang from the College of Marine Culture and Law at the Shanghai Ocean University. On average, 14,000 people were watching the conference livestream. Lu, FWI’s China Specialist and primary organizer of the Forum, found this discussion to be especially fruitful: We see this Forum as a step toward creating an environment in which we can start improving aquatic animal welfare in China. Attendees appreciated the ideas of welfare and had constructive discussions about its implementability in the Chinese aquaculture context. Together with ICCAW, we are currently considering an in-person roundtable with the Forum attendees to continue the dialogue. Recent Posts","text",6

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/introducing-fish-welfare-initiative","The following is cross-posted on theEA Forum.We’re excited to announce the launch ofFish Welfare Initiative(FWI), a new organization founded on the principles ofeffective altruismand incubated underCharity Entrepreneurship. Our mission is to reduce the suffering of fish as much as possible. We aim to achieve this via two stages: Identifying which welfare improvements, fish species, and countries have the highest potential for impact. Implementing a pilot program based on our findings, which we can later scale up or then pivot to a new approach. In this post, we make a case for focusing on fish and outline our plan for doing so. Why focus on fish? Others in the effective altruism community have already argued that working on fish could be high-impact (seehere,here, andhere). Below we examine working on fish through theITN framework. Importance: Fish are farmed in massive numbers: an estimated 111 billion fish are alive in aquaculture at any given point, mostly in intensive systems. 0.79 to 2.3 trillion more wild-caught fish are slaughtered annually. To put this into perspective, there are 31 billion terrestrial farmed animals alive at any given point [1]. Since fish, like other groups of farmed animals, are so numerous, scale will not be alimiting factoranytime soon. Of course, scale only matters insofar as the fish involved endure significant welfare issues. Sadly, they do: While different species, different regions, and different farming techniques involve different welfare challenges, some common issues includebad water quality and stocking densities,parasites,limited ability to express natural behaviors, andprolonged deaths without prior stunning. For a more complete list of fish welfare issues, see Compassion in World Farming’sreporton the welfare of farmed fish. There is also now a scientific consensus that fish very likely feel pain [2]. Neglectedness: Currently, few groups advocate for fish welfare.","text",4
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/introducing-fish-welfare-initiative","However, this is changing as fish welfare becomes a greater focus in both academia and advocacy organizations [3]. We expect that fish will be a future focus of the animal advocacy movement, as chickens are today.","text",5
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/introducing-fish-welfare-initiative","Tractability: This is the most uncertain aspect of working on fish issues, given the little historical advocacy and public support there has been for fish. However, there are several reasons in favor of fish being tractable: There is a growing scientific literature on the welfare needs of many species, which helps advocates know what standards to promote [4]. Some of these welfare needs, mostly relating to stunning before slaughter, have already been implemented. For instance, most UK rainbow trout are now stunned before slaughter, in large part due to support and pressure from the RSPCA and Humane Slaughter Association [5]. A few weeks ago, Tesco announced that it would stop selling live fish in their Polish locations, at least partly in response to pressure from advocacy groups [6]. Some changes, such as improving dissolved oxygen levels for farmed fish, may not be very costly to implement [7]. We hope that our work will provide further evidence to the tractability of fish. For more information on why we chose fish and the causes of their suffering, see our previous blog post:Why focus on fish? Which fish? Currently, we intend to focus primarily on farmed fish. Unlike wild-caught fish, humans influence the whole lives of farmed fish, not just their deaths. Additionally, the number of farmed fish stands to increase as the aquaculture industry continues to grow [8]. However, we do not mean to say that we should not work on the welfare of wild-caught fish. We are open to focusing on wild-caught fish in the future, and hope to see more organizations doing so. Some neglected fish groups that we probably will not focus on for the foreseeable future but are still promising includejuvenile fish in hatcheries,fish killed for fish meal,fish used for fish stocking,shellfish, andbaitfish. Our Plan There are two stages of our plan: research and implementation. Research We did not begin with an object-level plan.","text",6
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/introducing-fish-welfare-initiative","Rather, our high-level goal is to reduce fish suffering, and we are open to a variety of ways of achieving that.","text",7
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/introducing-fish-welfare-initiative","For the next six months, we will be answering the following questions in order to determine our object-level initiative: [9] Which species should we prioritize?Humans consume hundreds of different species of fish [10]. Because the welfare needs and treatment of different species vary greatly, this question is critical. Which welfare improvement(s) should we focus on?Some potential improvements includebetter dissolved oxygen levelsandbetter transportation and slaughter methods. Which are the best countries or regions to work in?Given that 88% of global farmed fish tonnage comes from Asia [11], our work will potentially focus in Asian countries. What kind of approach or campaign has the highest expected impact?Some examples include subsidizing equipment for improved welfare for farmers, working with corporations, and working with governments. We will publish our full findings on our website so that they can be used by other organizations or individuals working on fish issues. Implementation Based on our answers to these questions, we will publish a list of the 3-5 most promising initiatives. We’ll then start a small-scale pilot of our most promising initiative. As our impact looks more or less promising, we will scale up or down accordingly. For instance, one possible initiative would be to work with the government in Vietnam to secure stunning before slaughter forpangasius catfish, especially given that there is already pressure from European markets to implement higher welfare practices. Our long-term goal is to uncover a few initiatives that are extremely cost-effective and then scale these. This will likely take years and involve several pivots. Ultimately, we envision an FWI that is consistent in its impact and can be scaled based on available resources.","text",8

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/fish-movement-survey","Fish Movement Survey Results By Thomas Billington and Haven King-Nobles With billions of fish alive in farms and potentially trillions more caught in the wild each year, it is not surprising that many animal protection organizations are considering how they may be able to improve their welfare. However, fish welfare is a young field, and there are many open questions about how the animal protection movement will engage with it. Between May and June 2020, Fish Welfare Initiative surveyed 52 organizations on when, where, and how they plan to work for fish. Here we display and analyze the results from this survey. In addition, we reviewed the granting history of three major funding groups (Open Philanthropy Project, EA Animal Welfare Funds, and Animal Charity Evaluators) to assess historical funding for fish and crustacean welfare projects.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/policy-change","FWI India's Managing Director, Karthik Pulugurtha, at an aquaculture farm in Andhra Pradesh. Through our policy and government work in the third quarter of 2022, we have identified four promising avenues to help fishes in India by: Advocating for the government's guidelines becoming law in an attempt to help over a million fish. Urging the apex animal welfare body, the Animal Welfare Board of India, to release fish welfare advisories and circulars. Addressing the welfare gaps in state policy through advocacy. Working with the Bureau of Indian Standards to develop more ethical standards for fish. Though each avenue has its merits and limitations, we are excited to pursue these in the coming months. This blog post covers details about Fish Welfare Initiative (FWI) India’s learnings in the third quarter of 2022 and the opportunities they provide to work with governments, statutory authorities, and bodies for fish welfare policies and standards.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/policy-change","AnAlliance for Responsible Aquaculturefarm in West Godavari, Andhra Pradesh. An opportunity to help farmed fish was identified through some of our secondary research. We learned that some states like Uttarakhand and Maharashtra have advice on best aquaculture practices on their state fisheries departments’ websites. The interesting thing about these standards is that they urge farmers to take better care of their fish. While some of these provisions are not ideal for fish welfare most of the advice coincides with practices that promote fish welfare. Currently, this information is listed as aspirational guidelines or good-to-know information for fish farmers. They lack legal backing and implementation capacity because they are not formally notified by the respective state fisheries departments by way of a Government Order/s (G.O.), or a similar legal notification process. India’s quasi-federalism gives its different states the power to enact laws that fall under thestate list. Fisheries is a subject under the state list; new laws related to fisheries and aquaculture in a particular state are passed by the respective state government. Strategy: We plan to work with state fisheries departments to legally notify higher welfare aquaculture guidelines as mandatory practices. Once state fisheries departments legally notify higher welfare aquaculture practices it would make them enforceable. All aquaculture farmers in the respective states would have to abide by the notified standards and would even be liable for non-compliance. Path to Impact: Despite being fraught with challenges, India’s commitment towards policy intervention and enforcement connected to animal farming improves. For Instance, based on advice from environmental and animal protection organizations theCentral Pollution Control Boardof the Indian government has re-categorized large dairy and poultry facilities as major polluters requiring greater compliances and scrutiny.","text",6

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/policy-change","What is more, citizens trained by animal protection organizations like People For Animals, through afellowship program, are increasingly becoming part of the state animal welfare infrastructure and policy wings of animal protection organizations. This will ensure that there is greater scrutiny in favor of enforcing animal welfare policies. Fish welfare policy would have a greater opportunity to thrive as this policy ecosystem develops and takes root. Having said the above, the crucial benefits that animal welfare legislation brings is the legitimacy it adds to concerned citizens and animal protection organizations. When there are laws, bureaucrats and authorities are made responsible for their enforcement and concerned groups will be able to work with these officers to implement change on the ground.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/policy-change","A mrigal carp in an aquaculture pond. Mrigal is one of the three Indian major carp species that are commonly farmed in India. India, unlike many other countries, has a host of animal protection laws and institutions. The prominent among these is theAnimal Welfare Board of India(AWBI) which is the central statutory advisory body on Animal Welfare Laws and promotes animal welfare in India. From ensuring that animal welfare laws are followed, providing grants to animal welfare organizations, and advising the Government on animal welfare issues, the Board has been the face of the animal welfare movement in the country for the last 50 years.The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960,of which the AWBI is custodian, includes, in its definition of an ‘Animal’ fishes too. However, the AWBI has not yet stated its position on the welfare of fish. Relying on a 2013 advisory of the AWBI stating that the use of gestation crates to hold pigs violates The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, our partner organization Mercy for Animals recently campaigned to ban the use of gestation crates. The governments of six significant states—Delhi,Uttar Pradesh,Mizoram,Manipur,Uttarakhand, andGujarat—prohibited using gestation crates to hold pigs after appeals from Mercy For Animals India. MFA’s success inspired us to approach the AWBI to endorse higher welfare aquaculture practices. Strategy: We plan to work with the AWBI to issue advisories for welfare oriented aquaculture practices and dos and don'ts in line with The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. This exercise will be executed systematically by: First, tackling the most critical welfare issues like dissolved oxygen, stocking density, and pH levels for Indian major carp (IMC) by submitting draft standards for the AWBI to endorse. Second, we plan to submit a letter to the AWBI to advise fish farmers, sellers, and consumers not to indulge in cruel practices like live fish descaling or recreational fishing.","text",10
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/policy-change","Third, once we confidently develop our higher-welfare standards for IMC through learnings via our farm-level interventions in our Alliance for Responsible Aquaculture, we plan to request AWBI to endorse them via SOPs or farmer booklets/manuals.","text",11
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/policy-change","Path to Impact: AWBI advisories and circulars have good credibility with the courts, government departments and statutory bodies. AWBI advisories or circulars endorsing welfare oriented aquaculture and fishing practices would serve as foundational documents for us to rely on in our advocacy efforts with different state governments. The efforts to implement the AWBI advisories can be further bolstered by collaborating with the animal protection advocates and organizations in various states. Addressing the Welfare Gaps in State Policy Through our research and communication with state fisheries departments we learned that most states have not issued orders for stocking density of Indian major carp (IMC). Almost all state departments of fisheries confirmed that they have not issued any orders for permissible dissolved oxygen (DO) levels and pH levels for IMC. Strategy: To begin, we plan to take this opportunity to fill policy gaps and advocate with the state fisheries departments to issue orders for stocking density, DO, and pH levels for IMC from a higher welfare standpoint. Our site visits to fish markets revealed poor water quality and welfare in the housing and transport of live fish. By submitting reports and advocating with the marketing boards, committees and the government we have identified the below strategy to address the welfare, heath and food safety concerns from farms to markets. Strategy: Improve welfare of live fishes by working with the government to upgrade housing, water quality and transport of live fishes. Capacity building of government marketing departments, fish farmers and vendors about fish welfare through workshops and info-graphic posters. Path to Impact: These opportunities would help us make interventions from the farms to the markets and even transit. Capacity building with the government, farmers and vendors would increase sensitivity to fish welfare issues.","text",12

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/policy-change","Contributing to the Development of More Ethical Standards for Fish Through theBureau of Indian Standards(BIS) The BIS is the National Standard Body of India established under the BIS Act, 2016, for the harmonious development of standardization, marking, and quality certification of goods, products, and testing. BIS has a Food and Agriculture Department (FAD) and many committees within it. FAD 12 is the Fish, fisheries, and Aquaculture Sectional Committee. Fish Welfare Initiative India Foundation has been in touch with the Member Secretary of the FAD-12 and requested them to add FWI India to the committee’s mailing list. Regular follow-ups with the bureau have recently confirmed our addition to their mailing list, which is a valuable win for our work in the country. FWI India will now have the opportunity to provide comments, objections, technical inputs, and working drafts from a higher-welfare aquaculture standpoint for standards developed by the BIS in the fields of: Fisheries and Aquaculture including, but not limited to, terminology, technical specifications for equipment, operations, characterization of aquaculture sites, environmental monitoring, data reporting, traceability, waste disposal, code of transport, and maintenance of appropriate physical, chemical, and biological conditions. Fresh, processed, and packaged fish; fisheries and aquaculture products and by-products. Fish feed and feed ingredients. Physical, chemical, microbiological and organoleptic methods of test pertaining to this committee. Path to Impact: BIS standards are enforceable when mandated by court, the legislature or through government orders, they also serve as aspirational standards for businesses and producers. Working for the BIS on aquaculture and fisheries standards is a novel opportunity for FWI India as the BIS has no standards in these categories as of now. We will also be able to build credibility as a research and implementation organization with governments and departments.","text",14

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2022review","Our 2022 In Review Updated:Feb 21 Message from the Cofounders At FWI, we would love to be in a place where we have all the answers figured out—where, for instance, we knew exactly the right welfare improvements to make, exactly how much impact they have, and exactly how to incentivize farmers to take them up. Unfortunately, the extremely neglected nature of fish welfare work in Asian countries means that these fundamental questions have not (yet!) been sufficiently addressed. If we think of FWI through the explore/exploit paradigm—specifically of the tradeoff between figuring out how to best help fish versus actually helping them—in FWI’s 3.5 years of operation, we have largely fallen on the former side: A core part of our job is answering the unanswered questions; until recently, we have thus spent more efforts on program development than on scaling. 2022 felt like the first year when our research efforts started concretely paying off and indicating how exactly we could improve the lives of billions of fish. This progress largely came fromthinking of our strategymore intentionally through a theory-of-change-based lens, particularly as informed by perspectives and advisors from the global development space. Amongst other changes, this led to the refinement of ourfarmer workand the development of ourVersion 2 Welfare Standard, which our research suggests will be more impactful than ourVersion 1 Standard. For the progress made in our programming, 2022 was a good year. And it was not without its impacts: We estimate that we improved the lives of 720,000 fish in 2022, now putting FWI at1.14 million fish helped. At the end of the day, this is the number all of our work boils down to. 2022 was also a year of challenges, and probably our most challenging year yet.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2022review","There were periods, particularly the third quarter, when things felt like they were all falling apart, and we felt like we had little idea how best to continue running certain projects (see theKey Challenges and Learningssection below).","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2022review","Fortunately, we believe we have made significant progress in addressing these issues, and we ended the year on a high point: Our impact, our team, and our programming are all the strongest they’ve ever been. When you launch an organization, it feels as though you have a debt to pay to the world: You fundraise all this money and hire all these talented staff, much of which and many of whom would have otherwise supported other highly impactful organizations. For a while, you have little to no impact. And for a while, if you think of your impact as profit, the organization is clearly in the red. But now, with all we’ve learned, the 1.14 million fish we’ve helped, and the precedents in this unprecedented field we’ve set, we feel for the first time that, impact-wise, we are in the black—the considerable resources we've spent have been worth it. Thank you to all those who have helped us reach this day. —Tom and Haven, FWI Cofounders","text",4

This means we have improved the lives of1.14 million fishsince our founding, putting our cost effectiveness at about 1.3 fish helped per dollar. Expanded the Alliance for Responsible Aquaculture to 89 farms: We added an additional 31 farms to the ARA, from58at the end of 2021 to89at the end of 2022. Due also to internal improvements and staffing changes we made to it, the ARA is now running more effectively than ever before, though certainly still with many areas we are working to improve in. Developed Version 2 of our Welfare Standard: In December, we publishedVersion 2of our welfare standard. The focus of this new standard, as with most of our research across 2022, has been poor feed management (one of the most significant causes of poor water quality in Indian fish farms). We will begin testing the efficacy and implementability of Version 2 in the coming weeks.","text",6

A particular success here was being recognized by the Andhra Pradesh state Fisheries Department as an NGO working with fish farmers in the region. This is important because all recognized non-profits (currently ~32) receive draft policies from the state government for feedback, and Andhra Pradesh is home to the largest farmed fish population in India. Completed a farmer engagement project in the Philippines: We completed a6-month projectin the Philippines where we worked on the ground with farmers to better understand what the welfare issues were and how we could fix them. We had significant, even surprising, levels of traction with the government through this project, as seen by the local government’s co-hosting of our events and planned implementation of new fish farming ordinances.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2022review","Opening comments being delivered at our Aquatic Animal Welfare Forum at theWorld Conference on Farm Animal Welfare. We believe this event will pave the way to enable China’s future leadership in fish welfare internationally. Key Challenges and Learnings Though 2022 also saw us having stronger programs and a larger impact than FWI had ever had previously, it also held substantial challenges: We continued to struggle with running rigorous on-the-ground experiments: Partly due to the challenging, chaotic, and understudied nature of aquaculture, and partly due to our own team’s lack of experience, rigorous on-the-ground experiments remain a weaker area for FWI in India. In particular this year, the source of much internal worry was our original farmer feed management test, which due to operational challenges we eventually reduced in scope (from wanting to work with 6–10 fish farms to ultimately working with just 4 fish farms). We do believe we are improving in this area, as our current feed management test is progressing well; we are also having more realistic expectations about our capacities and arehiringfor areas where we currently lack expertise. Our corporate work achieved some success but not as much as intended: As can be seen above, in some ways our corporate work in India this year was very successful. However, it is evident from our2022 OKRsthat we were not as successful as we intended: We intended to complete a trial run of higher welfare fish being bought by a corporation; we failed. We intended to secure 2 commitments for corporations to transition at least part of their supply chains over to higher-welfare practices; we also failed (we do not feel the MOUs should count here, as they are too preliminary and will require significant further support, strategy, and incentives from our end to be realized). Part of our failure here was due to factors somewhat outside of our control, such as farmers valuing corporate market linkages less than we thought.","text",14
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2022review","An additional problem was poor planning, communication, and execution on our part. We believe we have learned from these mistakes and in our 2023 corporate work will not repeat them.","text",15
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2022review","Our high-intensity work culture sometimes caused staff too much stress: As can be seen in ourJune Culture Survey results, “overworking” and generally more and more complex work than we have the capacity to deal with are often issues at FWI. This felt particularly true in our third quarter of this year, where the aforementioned farmer feed management test ate up significant amounts of many of our staff members’ time, only for us to eventually pivot to a smaller test (and one that was actually within our ability to execute). Fortunately though, in part because of new staff members, and in part because of our efforts to more tightly design job descriptions such that people can play to their comparative advantages, we believe we are currently operating in a less-stressed working environment than we have for a long time. We will publish results from more recent culture surveys shortly, which we believe also show that the issue has improved.","text",16

The money to cover these expenses all came from generous donors, primarily those in the effective altruism and animal protection communities. FWI was also honored to be the recipient of a$250,000 grantfrom Open Philanthropy last August. Previous budgets and financial statements can be found on ourtransparency page. Internal policies: Especially towards the beginning of the year, FWI faced the unfortunately common situations of small to medium nonprofits having grown quicker than our internal policies and operations could keep up with. This was the first year we recognized this, and to correct for this we added new and/or more clear standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the ARA, operations, living accommodations, communications, hiring, and onboarding. ACE Standout Charity: FWI was honored to berecognizedby Animal Charity Evaluators as a Standout Charity, which we understand as a signal of the promise of our work and efficacy of our team.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/asian-countries-and-fish-welfare","How Much Do People in Asian Countries Care About Fish Welfare? Updated:Nov 25, 2020 The following post was written by a Fish Welfare Initiative volunteer, Karina Benitez Lin, who is the Corporate Outreach Officer at Igualidad Animal México. If you areinterestedin similar volunteering opportunities,please reach out. Public concern about animal welfare is increasing.Consumers demand transparency from companies about the products they sell and often promote and require animal welfare commitments. Cage-free campaigns and theBetter Chicken Commitmentare some of the most recent examples of public pressure influencing animal welfare standards. Therefore,understanding the public sentiment towards animals is essential for designing effective strategies for improving welfare. Few studies focus on the perception of animal welfare and meat consumption in an Asian context, and even fewer focus on fish specifically. The map below shows countries for which relevant data on publicperceptions towards animals and fish specifically is available. While not being exhaustive, these studies can give an idea of the attitudes towards fish across Asian countries.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/asian-countries-and-fish-welfare","Asian countries for which we found data on the public perception of animal or fish welfare are marked in blue. Asian consumers and animal welfare Consumers from various countries seem to become more aware of animal welfare issues. Sometimes these sentiments do not lead to action but recently, consumers actively choose products that they associate withhigherwelfare practices. In a 2014 survey, only about ⅓ of Chinese citizens reported that they had previously heard of animal welfare (You et al. 2014). Bothvegetarianism and organic foods are slowly growing in popularity(Li & Davey 2013). The Chinese government appears to become more open to considering society’s opinions within politics(Li 2006). Whether this creates a favorable environment for welfare reforms in the future is unclear. In Thailand, Malaysia, and China, consumers associate organic animal products with higher animal welfare (McCarthy et al. 2015;Wee et al. 2014). While organic products are often not equivalent to humanely raised products, this association shows that these consumers may make purchasing choices based upon perceived animal welfare. For Thai consumers, the health, origin, and sustainability of meat products are most important (in descending order) (Ueasangkomsate & Santiteerakul 2016). Consumers that value these criteria buy organic products. They do so under the impression that animal welfare is an integral part of organic goods, similar to the study participants in China, and Malaysia. These purchasing behaviors of animal products indicate that consumers are aware of welfare issues to some extent. They actively try to have theirvoicesheard by purchasing organic products following the belief that this means higher welfare. What about fish? There seems to be some awareness of animal welfare issues in general. This awareness often does not extend tofish.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/asian-countries-and-fish-welfare","Carp in Amritsar, India. Photo by Prerna Sharma. In 2010, Rajani (as cited inConte et al. 2014) found that consumers along Vietnam’s South-Central coast have little knowledge about the ethical problems affiliated with wild-caught fish. Still, they were worried about “pain, fear, and stress during wild fishes harvesting.” These animal welfare concerns, however, did not prevent consumers from buying fish. Consumers also did not discriminate between products with and without ecolabels (Gardiner & Viswanathan 2004;Jacquet & Pauly 2007). Interestingly, the surveyed Vietnamese population does not extend its concern for animal welfare to farmed fish.In contrast to their wild counterparts, farmed fish are disregarded as not being animals. Another survey of several Asian countries found thatChinese governments’ and citizens’ awareness of animal welfare is minimal(Bracke 2009). This attitude appears to reflect on fish consumption. Chinese restaurants cook and serve fish alive, and these events are often publicly displayed. The act of cutting and boiling a fish alive is a painful experience for the fish, who suffers for long periods of time. Similar live cooking of fish can be observed in Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Republic of Korea. It is unclear to what extent this practice relates to overall public awareness of fish welfare. In Russia, animal welfare is not on the governments’ radar (Bracke 2009). Instead, “food safety and health” is the usual interpretation of “animal welfare.” Awareness for this definition of fish welfare also differs between regions, with coastal areas being more aware of food safety issues in fish production than central Russia, where fish is mainly imported(Bracke 2009). Few studies have investigated how people from Asian countries perceive fish welfare.","text",7

Over the past 12 months, we conducted primary and secondary research in order to find a welfare standard that can: Improve on Version 1’s impact on welfare. Improve on Version 1’s implementability at scale. Teach us more about the most important aspects of aquaculture systems. OurVersion 1consisted of a stocking density cap and FWI staff evaluations of welfare at farm sites.Version 2adds to this a feed management protocol, which is designed to control phytoplankton blooms and prevent poor oxygen levels. Specifically, our Version 2 Standard consists of: A stocking density cap of 2,500–3,000 fish/acre (as in Version 1). A fortnightly FWI staff evaluation of welfare at the farm site and possible corrective actions provided (as in Version 1, though streamlined). Feed management: Fish feed on phytoplankton only (with no supplemental feed) for 3 consecutive days each month, in order to re-stabilize phytoplankton levels. Further phytoplankton-related corrective actions if flagged in the staff evaluation. We will continue testing and developingVersion 2via theAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture, and we expect to make minor adjustments to it and its delivery mechanism throughout the year.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/announcing-v2","Picture of Euglena, a class of phytoplankton. Our research this past year has found unbalanced phytoplankton to be the leading cause of poor oxygen levels, which is the main welfare issue fish face. Photo credit: Sinhyu. Background Across the 2 years that FWI has spent in the field in India, we have developed our understanding of the welfare issues that Indian major carp (the species that we predominantly work with) face, as well as the practical realities of reducing their suffering. Through a needs assessment and welfare infringements evaluation for Indian major carp (which we plan to publish soon),we have decided to prioritize dissolved oxygen levelsas the main welfare concern. In brief, dissolved oxygen refers to the amount of oxygen in the water that is available in water for fish to breathe. Low dissolved oxygen levels can lead to perpetual stress for fish as they struggle to breathe. However, too-high levels of dissolved oxygen  (“hyperoxia”) can also be stressful for fish, as can rapid changes in oxygen levels. Dissolved oxygen isone of the most important water quality parametersfor the welfare of farmed fish. Inour data set, we have seen that fish farm ponds are outside of ideal dissolved oxygen levels most of the time; during summer and the monsoon seasons (when water quality tends to decrease), critical oxygen levels (outside of ourrequired levels) are a frequent occurrence.","text",4

Often, in earthen pond systems (including the farms we work with in India),uncontrolled phytoplankton is thepredominant causeof dissolved oxygen level issues. Phytoplankton are microscopic organisms that live in the water column and both produce and consume oxygen. If the phytoplankton population become too large, oxygen balances become destabilized, leading to extreme highs and lows, which in turn cause distress to the fish in the system.","text",6

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/announcing-v2","A farmer using a Secchi disk (a device that helps assess phytoplankton levels). Most farmers do not monitor water quality regularly. Part of Version 2 aims to train farmers to take simple measurements such as this. Most farmers we work with in India do not regularly assess their phytoplankton or dissolved oxygen levels, nor take sufficient steps to mitigate the influence of these parameters on fish. As such, fish are often forced to suffer in inhospitable conditions (in the worst farms, this occurs for the majority of the year). Version 2 Feed management There are many potential avenues to control phytoplankton’s effect on dissolved oxygen (including aeration, pond preparation, and water exchange). Perhaps the most promising, is controlling feed inputs in order to prevent phytoplankton from over-producing. In their natural environment, Indian Major Carp feed on phytoplankton (alongside other organisms in the pond). However, farmers want fish to grow faster than natural. Because of this, semi-intensive and intensive farmers add supplemental feed to their farm ponds. When delivered, this supplemental feed typically leaches nutrients into the water. These introduced nutrients can significantly stimulate phytoplankton growth. Thus, stopping excess supplemental feeding to control phytoplankton levels is one of the most important improvements for dissolved oxygen and, thus, for improving fish welfare. Below is our protocol for controlling phytoplankton levels through feed management.","text",8

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/announcing-v2","Flowchart of FWI’s feed management protocol. Green circles represent directly impactful steps;blue boxes represent intermediary steps. Fish feed on phytoplankton only (no supplemental feed) 3 days per month Every farmer will be expected to stop applying supplemental feed for 3 consecutive days at the start of every month. This will act to prevent phytoplankton blooms by ensuring every fish farm pond has a substantial break from nutrient input, and will encourage fish to consume phytoplankton instead. Breaks of supplemental feed do not negatively affect the welfare ofIndian major carp, as these species will naturally consume phytoplankton. There are papers showing that Indian major carp seem to be either unaffected or to benefit from periods of no feed (seehere,here, andhere). Phytoplankton evaluation & corrective actions Once every two weeks, an FWI representative will visit each farm within theARAto measure the following: Turbidity Water color pH Temperature Ourdata analysishas indicated that these parameters have a strong correlation (~0.8) with chlorophyll-a (the predominant proxy we use for phytoplankton). These parameters will be considered in concert with other important factors, such as the pond’s history and the time of year. For every alternate measurement, a more in-depth analysis will be performed at the farms. (Seecorrective actionsbelow).","text",10

Pond scum is usually composed of phytoplankton and can be an indicator of imbalanced phytoplankton populations. Part of Version 2 will regular checks for signals of phytoplankton-related problems. If a problem is detected during these field measurements, FWI staff will suggest a future course of action. For phytoplankton blooms, these suggestions may include: Increasing the number of days where fish feed on only phytoplankton (no supplemental feed). Introducing aeration devices to the system. Additional training and support for farmers to take and respond to measurements. Stopping fertilization. It will be up to the discretion of the respective FWI staff member to decide what exact corrective action to assign. However, we plan to build a more specific protocol as we gain more experience with farmers implementing these improvements. Farmer training We also plan for eachARAfarmer to receive training in what phytoplankton is, why it is a critical issue for fish health and welfare, and how to detect issues like phytoplankton blooms. Each farmer will be provided a Secchi disk (a small tool used to measure turbidity—an indicator of phytoplankton levels) and be encouraged to take measurements at least once a week. If farmers notice any concerning issues, they can have an FWI representative perform an early phytoplankton evaluation. In summary, our feeding protocol will have farmers letting fish feed on phytoplankton only (no supplemental feed) for 3 consecutive days every month in order to help reduce phytoplankton  levels and prevent subsequent blooms. FWI will measure each farm once every 2 weeks to evaluate phytoplankton-related issues and assign corrective actions as needed. Further, farmers will be trained to understand why phytoplankton is a concern and how to identify the issue using simple equipment and observations (which they can then use to flag issues to FWI representatives).","text",12
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/announcing-v2","Other aspects The additional components of Version 2 are roll-over aspects fromVersion 1, including:","text",13
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/announcing-v2","Stocking densities Stocking densities refer to the number of fish divided by the amount of space available to those fish. Stocking densities that are too high negatively affect the lives of fish by degrading water quality, increasing occurrences of injury, and adding psychological stress. Our requirements are: Grow-out stocking (later life-stage fish) will not exceed 2500–3000 fish/acre and 80,000 shrimp/acre. Breeding stocking (earlier life-stage fish) will not exceed 50,000 fish/acre. Corrective actions Alongside the phytoplankton evaluation, our field staff will perform a full evaluation during every alternate farm visit. This will include more measurements (such as checking for signs of disease) and the use of our more advanced equipment by trained staff. If problems are identified, corrective actions will be assigned to farmers (see our current document on corrective actions). We plan to do this more intensive measurement protocol only once a month, as many of our problems with scaling come from the use of complex and cumbersome equipment. As such, our goal is to assess our phytoplankton evaluation as a simplified measuring system that can capture similar value, and thus will only need to be occasionally supplemented with more in-depth analysis. Why is this better than Version 1? Version 2 is better than Version 1 in a few key ways: More impactful Over 2022, we have been refining our understanding of the key welfare issues within Indian farms and their causes. Byfocusing more attention on dissolved oxygen, we are able to weigh our resources more heavily on the main welfare issue that fish are facing. We also believe that our mixture ofpreventative measures(3-day breaks where fish feed only on phytoplankton) andregular check-insand assignment of further action if needed is a strong balance that can stand to significantly reduce the issue of oxygen imbalance.","text",14
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/announcing-v2","More scalable Often, dissolved oxygen problems are more concentrated across a few farms and a few months of the year. However, Version 1 currently distributes our resources evenly across all farms. This means that resources are being used inefficiently; thus it will be harder to achieve impact at scale.","text",15
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/announcing-v2","Version 2 solves this byimplementing a blanket preventative measure(3-day breaks during which fish feed only on phytoplankton), while allowing theflexibilityfor more attention and further actions to be taken in the places that need it. Version 2 also stands as our first large-scale trial of farmers performing their own measurements, which, were it to be successful, could massively increase our ability to scale our project. Higher learning value In focusing our attention on the worst issues, and testing new strategies, such as farmer education, we are transitioning away from learning about the welfare of the systems more broadly and toward learning more about the specific issues present and the potential delivery mechanisms we can adopt for fixing them. Conclusion & Plans for 2023 We createdVersion 2of our welfare standard with the intention of having a bigger impact at scale than withVersion 1. We believe that what we have outlined in this document will succeed at this. However, the reality of work in a novel field such as Indian Major Carp welfare is that it will likely take us many iterations to find a sufficiently impactful and scalable standard. For this reason, we have alreadyset a goal for updating to a Version 3by the end of 2023. Version 2, we hope and believe, will target the worst welfare issue (dissolved oxygen) and make a significant, cost-effective, and scalable change. We also believe that, along with our progressing corporate and government work, Version 2 will propel more intensive improvements to fish welfare in India. Over the next year, we will evaluate Version 2 of the standard as we slowly roll it out through theARA. We plan to introduceVersion 2fully around mid-2023. Until then, we will implement it in a smaller section of farms and refine the standard. We will also continue to investigate other promising options for improving the lives of fish, including and apart from improving dissolved oxygen. Recent Posts","text",16

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/china-plans","Our One and Three Year Plans in China Updated:Aug 15, 2022 Fish Welfare Initiative has engaged with Chinese stakeholders for the past 1 ½ years. In June 2021, the nonprofit organization International Cooperation Committee of Animal Welfare (ICCAW) invited us to host the first-ever Aquatic Animal Welfare Forum at theWorld Conference on Farm Animal Welfarein April 2022. This event gave us the unique opportunity to introduce the topic of aquatic animal welfare to a Chinese audience.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/china-plans","A screenshot of our pre-event speaker and host meeting at theWorld Conference on Farm Animal Welfare. The forum was a success and gave us a more detailed view of the opportunities and challenges of fish welfare in China. Following the event, we thus felt sufficiently informed to develop a more coherent vision of the most impactful way of helping fishes in China. Over the past five months, we’ve spoken with local animal welfare advocates and external advisors to determine ourOneandThree YearPlans. Building Foundations: FWI’s One Year Plan in China In the following year(June 2022- June 2023), we will pursue four main goals to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the needs and opportunities of fishes on Chinese farms. Build a strong partnership with ICCAWto raise awareness and build local welfare standards for aquatic animals. Conduct a literature review and priority species researchin cooperation with Chinese academics. Place aquatic animal welfare into the landscape of Chinese animal advocacyby working with local advocacy organizations. Conduct (a) field visit(s)to identify fish farmers’ understanding of welfare and the bottlenecks for aquaculture stakeholders in improving welfare. China's aquaculture industry is the biggest in the world, being responsible for almost70% of world production. OurChina Scoping Reportoutlines the key welfare challenges fish on Chinese farms seem to face. During our scoping work, we did not find many projects addressing these pressing issues. However, working more closely with Chinese stakeholders this year, we found that local fish farmers research and implement various practices to “raise fish well”. We believe that they usually don’t describe their work as “welfare work” and their efforts thus remain absent from international fish welfare discussions. We are planning a literature review to bring light to the state of “welfare” research in Chinese academia.","text",4
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/china-plans","We expect that this will help us understand existing and missing welfare improvements. The literature review will be conducted in cooperation with researchers from the Shanghai Ocean University.","text",5
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/china-plans","The goal of the subsequent priority species research aims to identify which fish groups should be prioritized for our planned welfare improvement research and aquaculture standards (see details below). This project will also explore farmers’ understanding of welfare and willingness to cooperate with NGOs and academics to improve practices. We hope to complement this research with at least one field visit. However, visiting China has been challenging (even for Chinese nationals) due to ongoing entry restrictions related to COVID. Broader Vision: FWI’s 3 Year Plan Post-June 2023, we will continue working with ICCAW and research institutes to focus on building aquatic animal welfare standards. Doing so will involve forming a working group of welfare experts to explore impactful and implementable improvements. While making the standards, we will contact industry stakeholders to get early buy-in for the drafted welfare improvements. COVID-permitting, we will host smaller events on aquatic animal welfare to raise awareness among academic, nonprofit, and industry circles. By late 2024, we expect stable partnerships with various Chinese stakeholders covering research, the public sector, and advocacy. We will likely scale our work through exploring welfare model towns and the place of welfare in the Chinese government’s strategies on “rural revitalization” and “green sustainable development of aquaculture”. We will also further advance the welfare research team and help promote the uptake of the previously developed welfare standards. You can find detailed information about our yearly goals in ourThree Year Plan.","text",6

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/china-plans","Our high-level theory of change for how FWI plans to help fish in China. Each item has a more detailedsub-theory of change. Key Uncertainties With Our Plans While these are our most informed visions for future work, we expect plans to change. The following outlines key uncertainties with ourOneandThree YearPlans. Working with ICCAW to develop standards is a unique opportunity to influence a vast number of fishes. These standards will also play an important symbolic role in embedding fish welfare in Chinese aquaculture practices. However, thestandards will not be mandatory,and industry adherence is thus not guaranteed. We expect to minimize this risk by ensuring the implementability of the standards and getting early buy-in from industry stakeholders. Regarding the creation of the welfare standards, we expect similar challenges to the ones we encounter inIndia:It is difficult to develop implementable and impactful welfare standards that sufficiently improve welfare and whose impact can be reliably measured. This is particularly true for species with little prior welfare research like carp. Early involvement of academics and farmers is our main strategy for reducing this uncertainty. COVID-related entry restrictions have made it impossible to plan or conduct afield visit in China. This is unfortunate because we expect great value from visiting fish farms and connecting with our local stakeholders. If we cannot enter China by the end of the year, we will likely rely on our local partners to conduct field visits. However, we are aware that their second-hand experiences may limit our ability to fully understand local aquaculture challenges.","text",8
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/china-plans","Staying on Track: Accountability Tracking our progress on these plans, we included new key results in ourAnnual OKRs(Objective 6: International): In-person aquatic animal welfare seminar organized with ICCAW: - Goal: 1 Literature review on priority species published internally in Chinese in cooperation with Chinese aquaculture academic - Goal: 1","text",9

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/vietnam","Fish Welfare Scoping Report: Vietnam By Haven King-Nobles, Thomas Billington, Jennifer-Justine Kirsch, and ​Trang Đặng Although roughly 100 billion farmed fish are slaughtered annually, little has been done regarding their welfare. Fish Welfare Initiative aims to improve the welfare of farmed fish by working collaboratively with industry and NGO partners. We also believe in not limiting our scope to Western countries, but rather focusing on the regions of the world that have the greatest potential for impact, wherever those may be. ​ One such country we examined is Vietnam. In this report, we outline the various fish aquaculture systems used in Vietnam and assess the potential for work to promote higher welfare. Our main findings are as follows: ​ Production and species:​ Vietnam is the 5th largest producer of farmed fish globally. The main finfish group farmed in Vietnam is Pangasius (a genus of shark catfish), which comprises 47% of Vietnamese finfish production. Pangasius are primarily farmed in intensive pond culture and cage culture, which are highly concentrated in the Mekong River Delta Region. Vietnam produces the vast majority of globally-exported Pangasius. Welfare improvements:​ The most promising welfare interventions in Vietnam seem to be working with European importers of Pangasius to mandate improved water quality, shorter and less stressful transportation routines, and pre-slaughter stunning (although optimal Pangasius stunning parameters still need to be developed). Small-scale aquaculture and wet markets:​ While the Vietnamese aquaculture industry is increasingly vertically integrated, 75% of producers still operate on farms of less than 3 hectares in size. These systems tend to be more extensive, and pose different welfare challenges (such as a lack of monitoring of environmental conditions). Most fish produced in small-scale aquaculture are sold (often live) in wet markets, which is highly detrimental to fish welfare.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/vietnam","Logistical and other bottlenecks:​ It is a long and difficult process to register a non-profit organization in Vietnam. Public attitudes on animal welfare (and particularly regarding fish) are not very progressive, given that animal welfare itself is a relatively new topic in Vietnam.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/vietnam","Messaging:​ Work promoting fish welfare will be more likely to succeed if coupled with initiatives to improve product quality, business resilience, and sustainability. ​ We encourage any organization or industry interested in promoting fish welfare in Vietnam to ​contact us.​ We are available to provide consulting, training in fish welfare improvements, and access to funding.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/_sage","Announcing FWI's First Corporate Partner On September 21, 2021,SAGE Organics, a Hyderabad-based sustainability brand, committed to improving fish welfare. In doing so, SAGE became not only FWI’s first corporate partner but the first corporation that we’re aware of in all of India topublicly committo improving fish welfare. Although the scale of SAGE’s fish production is small, we believe this is a monumental step to improve the lives of fishes in India, the country with the second-highest number of farmed fish globally (seeSOFIA 2020p. 34). The Corporation: SAGE SAGE Organics operates a permaculture farm (Baby Elephant Farm), store, and cafes in Hyderabad, India. SAGE is unusual among Indian food businesses in several ways which we believe makes them an unusually good first partner: SAGE is deeply committed to sustainability and animal welfare. Although many businesses make such claims, our visit to SAGE’s farm made evident that SAGE was actually putting this commitment into action and is not motivated by profit alone. SAGE has a largely integrated, traceable supply chain. This is unlike most corporations we have worked with in India, which have at least one layer of middlemen in between them and the farmers, limiting both traceability as well as the corporation’s influence over production practices. SAGE, on the other hand, has no such middlemen and thus influences their production practices directly. SAGE has yet to begin farming fish, which meant that they were open to adopting new best practices. They plan to start selling their first farmed fish in the next few months, and likely will farm carp (the species group FWI has the most experience working with). SAGE’s fish production is relatively small—all farmed fish for the foreseeable future sold at SAGE will be raised in their 0.3-acre pond.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/_sage","Although we of course seek to improve the lives of as many fish as possible, we see value in starting small to ensure that the welfare improvements are actually impactful before scaling.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/_sage","The Commitment SAGE committed to a number of higher welfare practices for their future farmed fish. The most significant of these is a stocking density cap of 1500 fish/acre, which is significantly lower than most carp farms stock and we believe constitutes a significant welfare improvement. For context, most of the farms we’ve visited in Andhra Pradesh stock between 3000 and 7000 fish/acre, and our ARA farmerscommitto stocking only below 3000 fish/acre. SAGE also committed to several other practices that we expect will improve fish welfare, including water quality monitoring, only procuring fish seed from FWI approved sources, and minimizing handling. We are especially excited that SAGE is willing to work with FWI to investigate more humane slaughter methods, as slaughter without stunning is a welfare infringement invariably suffered by fish across India and many other countries. However, research must still be undertaken to identify feasible avenues for pre-slaughter stunning with carp in middle-income countries like India. The full commitment is effective immediately and can be seenhere. The Bigger Picture These improvements should impact about500 fish per year. Although the actual number of fish helped here is relatively small, given the precedent this sets and the partner SAGE is we are very excited about this development. Our work with SAGE is part of FWI’sbroader strategyin India of 1) transitioning the supply of farmed fish towards fish raised in higher welfare methods (namely our work with farmers), and 2) transitioning the demand for farmed fish to support such supply changes (namely our work with corporations like SAGE). We intend to gain further corporate commitments such as this one in which corporations commit to improving their current farmers’ production practices, as well as commitments from corporations to transition their procurement to ourARA suppliers.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/breathing-underwater-the-most-important-findings-from-our-dissolved-oxygen-study","FWI data collectors Manikanta and Ghandi collecting data for the study. Key Findings Water Quality: DO was within acceptable only ranges 23% of the time in the morning and 32% of the time in the evening. Indian Major Carp (the species of fish being farmed in this study) are able to tolerate poor DO levels, but the persistence with which poor DO was experienced likely meant that fish were significantly stressed, as they were unable to recover. This was made worse by the prevalence of other water quality issues such as ammonia (42% within acceptable levels) and pH (63% within acceptable levels). Biomass: A surprisingly strong relationship was observed between fish biomass and DO levels. Higher biomass, particularly noted before “harvesting” (when fish are taken from farms to be sold to market), was often linked with lower DO levels. This relationship highlights the toll that overstocking can take, as fish consume oxygen in higher amounts than the system is able to generate. Phytoplankton: Phytoplankton blooms also appeared to be a cause of DO issues, though it appeared to be less important than fish biomass. Gasping: Notably, fish gasping events – a dire sign of oxygen deprivation – tended to occur when DO levels dipped below 1 mg/L and ammonia levels increased above 0.5 mg/L (which happened 6 times during the study). This is evidence that these two stressors combine into one of the most harmful experiences for fish.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/breathing-underwater-the-most-important-findings-from-our-dissolved-oxygen-study","Implications These results tell us a few things. A deeper assessment of these fish farming ponds with known DO issues shows thatfish likely suffer perpetually in such conditions, both from DO itself and from further water quality problems (ammonia especially), which in concert with DO are likely very stressful for fish. More speculatively, we may compare this to severe respiratory problems in humans (such as those caused by a motor neuron disease), where “The person has great difficulty walking even short distances or climbing any stairs, feels tired when at rest, and is anxious” (The Institute For Health Metrics And Evaluationgave this condition a Disability Weight of 0.4). These findings help to confirm our beliefs that more attention is needed on these farms, and shows that not all fish farming ponds are equal in their level of suffering caused. Also, these results seem to show thatFWI might have been wrongto focus as much on phytoplankton, and that biomass may also need to be a key part of improving DO levels. We will continue to think more about the implications this should have for theAlliance for Responsible Aquacultureand for our R&D department. We believe these findings highlightthe importance of a deep understandingof what animals are experiencing on farms. Even now after two years of operation in India, we are still learning vital information on how we may best help fish on Indian farms.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/announcing-the-alliance-for-responsible-aquaculture","Announcing the Alliance for Responsible Aquaculture We are excited to announce the launch of theAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture(ARA) – a first-of-its-kind collective of farmers and stakeholders who incorporate practices to improve the welfare of fish and the well-being of farmers. Alongside our partners in India, farmers are incorporating best management practices tailored for regional conditions. Specifically, the first batch of farmers in Andhra Pradesh are already implementing responsible stocking densities, and will soon implement improved water quality management, as per theAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture Commitment. These practices, along with other region-specific improvements, are central to building a sustainable future for aquaculture in India. We are working further to build a momentum that would see these collectives gain support infrastructure and establish more direct market linkages. These linkages are being established with retailers and consumers who would pay a premium for traceability and food safety. The mobilization of aqua farmers through the ARA will help in their certification throughParticipatory Guarantee Systems (PGS), in turn enhancing their ability to access premium markets. The Alliance for Responsible Aquaculture creates a fairer, kinder, and more natural aquaculture sector in India. By raising more responsibly farmed fish, ARA farmers answer a growing market segment for responsibly produced food. The Indian government is investing heavily in the growth of its aquaculture sector through policy initiatives like thePradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana(PMMSY). With the PMMSY, the government sets a clear signal about the need for aquaculture to develop sustainably and responsibly. Furthermore, society increasingly demands more natural and humane products. Particularly after COVID gripped our reality in India, consumers are seriously concerned about the safety of meat and are looking for reliable and traceable alternatives.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/announcing-the-alliance-for-responsible-aquaculture","More Fair Being part of the Alliance for Responsible Aquaculture would mean that small and mid-sized farmers will play to their strengths. These farmers minimize their operational risks by proactively managing ponds better, instead of investing heavily in chemical and pharmaceutical inputs. Many innovators in India likeBeejomandCentre for Sustainable Agriculture(CSA) increased small farmer incomes this way by reducing their input costs and promoting natural production systems. These social movement started because many small farmers who feed most of India have become heavily indebted because of high input costs associated with intensive systems. [1] In CSA’s case, its sustainable production models even helped farmers get out of crippling debt. This was achieved by building a committed community of farmers who stopped borrowing heavily to buy commercial inputs. Instead they invested time in producing their own natural inputs and thus playing to their strengths. How would this model be applied in the aquaculture sector? Aqua farmers make their operations more profitable by reducing disease and mortality rates. Well-managed, more extensive systems require fewer inputs, such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals and feed, further reducing the cost of production. [2] A lack of supportive credit systems, rising input costs, and fluctuating markets make intensification difficult for a majority of the farms, which have always been small or mid-sized. [3] Overall, welfare-oriented practices will reduce the need for many inputs at a moment in time when the prices of these inputs are rising. [4] It would be wrong to see more extensive farms as simply an opportunity to further intensify. This is because small and mid-sized farmers will need to borrow heavily in a system without easy access to formal credit systems to set up intensive facilities. Instead they should be empowered to flourish in their local community by adopting more natural models.","text",5
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/announcing-the-alliance-for-responsible-aquaculture","More Natural Farming more responsibly helps to improve the sustainability of aquaculture. Fish farms often use the same water systems as local communities. For instance, aquaculture in Andhra Pradesh has an impact on the waters of the Godavari river and the Kolleru. Polluting or exploiting these water systems can cause damage to surrounding communities and wildlife. [5]","text",6
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/announcing-the-alliance-for-responsible-aquaculture","Two FAO reports [6] highlight that there are potential risks to public health and ecosystems associated with unfettered growth in aquaculture in many parts of India. This is because intensified aquaculture frequently has very high stocking densities, leading to high chemical load in wastewater and may pollute local reservoirs. By practicing more responsible aquaculture, fish experience fewer diseases, and farmers need fewer antibiotics. As a result, the chemical load in the wastewater is reduced. Wild fish populations are also conserved by reducing the risk of disease spread to these. By committing to farm more naturally, farmers in the ARA commit to keeping ecosystems intact for local communities to enjoy and use. More Kind The current systems predominantly place fish in crowded condition, leaving a higher chemical footprint. The environment and the communities in the proximity are negatively impacted by not allowing animals to thrive in farming environments. [7] Considering that fish are sentient beings capable of feeling pain, [8] we have a duty to protect their welfare under our care. Maintaining responsible stocking densities and maintaining good water quality is the first step towards healing communities and the fishes.","text",7

This is not only for the resulting social and environmental benefits, but also because we believe that fish deserve better treatment than they are currently given. Specifically, we believe that fish welfare is currently unsatisfactory in many aquaculture facilities. To properly understand what it means to bring positive welfare to fish, we must first understand what we refer to when we say “welfare.” This report considers the working definition of welfare that Fish Welfare Initiative uses in its operations.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/fish-and-human-health","As healthcare systems continue to struggle with this pandemic, COVID is merely the most recent reminder that diseases can jump from animals to humans. Farmed fish are no exception to this rule. COVID has also been found infish. The health of fish consumers depends on the health of the fish. On farms, fishes’ health is compromised by diseases andstressful practices, such as rough handling, monotonous environments, and crowding. These issues arise because fishes’ well-being is compromised. Ultimately, fish welfare matters to both fish and human health. Fish Welfare and Food Safety Germs can jump fromanimals to humansand vice versa. Common management practices such as handling and crowding regularly cause wounds and lesions on the farmed fish's skin. Bacteria can enter through these wounds and are then ingested by consumers. Once germs enter the fish, they are able to quickly multiply. They do so phenomenally well when fish are stressed because stress compromises their immune system.All of this bacterial activity creates a serious health risk for consumers, a significant concern that has been acknowledged by theEuropean Food Safety Authority. Stressed fish are also more susceptible to viruses. On farms, most disease outbreaks are linked to poor rearing practices that placestress on fish. The industry typically uses antimicrobials to combat disease outbreaks, butany erroneous administration of antimicrobial agents holds the risk of furtheringantimicrobial resistancein both fish and humans. Worms in Fish? Disease isn’t the only thing that can be transmitted from fish to humans. In the past,consumers have found nematodes(roundworms) in fish meat. It is hard to prevent parasites such as worms from entering fish, especially when they are given live feed. Instead, it is easier to identify and treat the signs of worm infection. Producers need to monitor fishes’ well-being to identify issues and act accordingly.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/fish-and-human-health","Product Quality Farmers raise most fish to be processed and sold. Thus, an impeccable product is the holy grail of every farmer. Although inhumane rearing and slaughter practices continue to beindustry standard, more and more studies suggest that high welfare creates a better product. For example, fish that experience less stress have alater rigor mortis(the process of becoming stiff after death). Preventing stiffness prolongs the fishes’ shelf-life and makes the meat firmer, less watery, and more colorful - all attributes that consumers value in fish meat.","text",6

Optimal water quality, minimal handling, resting time, and stunning before slaughter make for a fresh, unscathed product. The Power of Play New research has revealed another surprising element to ensuring food safety and fish welfare:environmental enrichment. Environmental enrichment is the addition of structural, social, dietary, and/or sensory complexity. Enriching fishes’ environment improves thepositive welfareof fishes and also positively influences fishgrowth and health. Hugh Ross, a salmon farmer fromLoch Duart, observed his salmon nipping on each other’s fins. Fin damage lowers the price of fish on the market and seriously stresses the fish. By adding simple structures replicating seaweed, he observed a decrease in fin-nipping. The fish also distributed themselves more evenly across the tank, thus giving each fish more space. Recently, Hugh’s anecdotal findings were backed up by astudythat observed fish growing faster when they were given environmental enrichment.","text",8

Photo credit: IPMA, Olhão Portugal. A note on environmental enrichment: To date, only limited research on appropriate environmental enrichment for different species is available, and generalizing interventions can be detrimental. For example, added substrate, which improves the welfare of some fish species, can also be a breeding ground for parasites (Gangadhara et al. 2016). While we should use environmental enrichment where it has proved effective, we need more species-specific research to properly utilize this welfare improvement. Harmful Wastewater Moving on from artificial to real seaweed, enriching farms with marine fauna is also a great tool for wastewater treatment. Many fishes enjoy the structural complexity of seaweed in their tanks, and these underwater plants oxygenate the water during the day. Seaweed also removes harmful nutrients from the environment. Fish farms are increasingly critiqued for discharging nutrients into nearby waters. Farm water drainage contains high levels of nutrients that pollute local waterways anddeplete their oxygen. Using seaweed as a biofilter can remove a substantial amount of these nutrients (learn more:Schuenhoff et al. 2003,Lamprianidou, Telfer, & Ross 2015). This intervention cleans the fishes’ environment and protects both humans and wildlife in the neighborhood from the adverse impacts of contaminated groundwater. Thus,enriching farms with seaweed can offer a win-win situation for the fish, the environment, and humans. Ultimately, the welfare of fish strongly relates to the well-being of humans. If we want to protect the environment, our health, the fish, and have a good product, we need to take into account the welfare of fish. Recent Posts","text",10

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2024studies","Overview of our 2024 R&D Studies Updated:Mar 27 By Dr. Paul Monaghan, Fish Welfare Initiative Research & Development Lead Summary:In late 2023, we broadened the mandate of our research to explore other theories of change, in the hope that they could be more impactful than what we are currently executing. Our R&D Department conducts field studies to inform these theories—this post gives an overview of the four such studies we are conducting in 2024. Introduction Last year weestablishedour new Research & Development (R&D) Department, with the stated goal being todevelop new theories of change and to conduct studies to inform FWI programs to improve the lives of fishes.As 2023 drew to a close we published ablogpostbroadly outlining the R&D Department’s plans for 2024. In that post, we mentioned that we were in the process of shortlisting a number of studies and we committed to sharing more about our plans once decisions had been made. This blogpost is a follow-up, presenting an overview of the studies we have selected to conduct in 2024. We’re intending for these studies, if and where they resolve positively, to contribute to strengthening our programs in the following ways: Increasing our effectiveness by detecting welfare issues remotely, as opposed to in-person (i.e. the satellite imagery study). Identifying new, cost effective avenues for making welfare improvements (i.e. the modified feed study). Improving the evidence base and our ability to evaluate our interventions (i.e. the DO tolerance and welfare assessment protocol studies). Selected Studies Four studies have been selected thus far. Here we provide a brief overview of the background, hypothesis, and timelines for each. Study 1: Validating satellite imagery for remote monitoring of water quality at fish farms Background: FWI’s current core program—theARA—requires data collectors to physically visit individual farms, with the current strategy being to conduct visits about once a month or more to each pond.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2024studies","Utilizing satellite imagery as a means for remotely monitoring water quality would allow us to collect water quality data more regularly, while simultaneously limiting the requirement to actually visit farms.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2024studies","Hypothesis:If we can show that key water quality data collected through analysis of satellite imagery are sufficiently accurate and reliable, the ARA model could be modified to exploit remote data collection, allowing for more frequent collection of water quality data at all farms without the need for additional human resources. Timeline: Q1 through Q2, 2024. (Note: We already published ablogpost in Februaryto coincide with the beginning of field work for this study. We expect to know before the end of Q2 if this concept is sufficiently promising to take forward.)","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2024studies","Study 2: Assessing whether de-oiled rice bran (DORB) feed supplemented with selected low-cost nutrients is cost-effective for farmers to utilize for the grow-out phase of Indian major carp Background: The vast majority of farmers of Indian major carp (IMC) in Andhra Pradesh at the grow-out stage of the farming process use DORB as the primary form of supplemental feed (considered “supplemental” as fishes also feed on naturally-occurring plankton). However, DORB is not considered a suitable feed due to its poor nutritional value coupled with its “anti nutritional” quality (components that reduce nutrient utilization, leading to impaired metabolic performance). DORB is the feed type of choice for IMC farmers in Andhra Pradesh due to its low cost. Hypothesis: If we can produce DORB supplemented with selected nutrients at a low cost, and show that the additional cost is met—or exceeded—by the increased margins that farmers gain from selling fishes considered to be of better “quality”, we could consider a future program whereby we work with manufacturers to produce supplemented DORB and encourage farmers to use it. Timeline: Q1 through Q4, 2024 (Note: We expect the data-collection component of this study to be completed by the end of Q3, with data analysis extending into Q4. We expect to know before the end of the year if the supplemented DORB is superior to regular DORB to inform if we can take this idea forward.)","text",6

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2024studies","Study 3: Development of a welfare assessment protocol to assess welfare of Indian major carp at grow-out stage farms in Andhra Pradesh Background: The ARA uses water quality parameters as a proxy for fish welfare, with the assumption being that if water quality is poor, fishes suffer. While water quality is crucial for creating and maintaining a suitable environment for fish, it is considered preferable to have a more direct assessment of fish welfare, rather than relying solely on proxies. Hypothesis: If trials in real-life settings indicate that a welfare assessment protocol is sufficiently contextualized to the realities of fish farms supported by FWI, and that the information obtained through conducting the welfare assessment provides useful and consistent data for assessing welfare conditions, the protocol could be rolled out to serve as a critical monitoring and evaluation (M&E) tool for FWI. This would help us more objectively (i) understand welfare needs (which would help with targeting farms—and therefore, fishes—most in need of support), and (ii) more effectively assess our impact. Timeline: Q1 through Q4, 2024 (Note: This project involves developing a “beta version” of a protocol, which will be tested and iteratively improved based on trials over the course of a number of months at fish farms. We expect the final version to be finalized by the end of the year, ready to serve as a key M&E tool for 2025.) Study 4: Assessment of dissolved oxygen (DO) levels that Indian major carp can tolerate without welfare concerns Background:DO is considered the key water quality parameter by FWI, and many of our decisions around fish welfare are based on DO levels. The corrective actions currently utilized by the ARA program include an “optimal” (narrow range) and a “required” (broader range) DO range, but the evidence for these ranges, particularly as they pertain to IMC—considered quite tolerant to DO—needs to be strengthened.","text",8
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2024studies","Hypothesis:If we can conduct a laboratory-based experiment to ascertain the DO range which IMC can tolerate without welfare concerns, this could inform the corrective actions issued as part of the ARA. It could also inform if FWI’s focus on DO is justified, or needs to be reconsidered.","text",9
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/2024studies","Timeline:Q1 through Q4, 2024. (Note: We expect the data-collection component of this study to be completed by mid-Q3, with data analysis extending into Q4. We expect results in early Q4.) Selection Process of These Studies We selected these studies through an internal process, overseen by the R&D Lead who has extensive experience with designing and overseeing large-scale research studies. The studies presented in this blogpost are those that resulted from the process described below: Ideas for studies were solicited via an open process, encouraging contributions from everyone within FWI so as to take advantage of everyone’s unique perspective and insight of welfare issues at the farms we work with. These ideas were individually assessed by a panel from the R&D Department, using carefully selected criteria designed by the R&D Lead based on his experience of evidence-based programming at scale. Following individual assessments, the panel convened to discuss their individual and collective assessments to allow the panel to hone in on the ideas most suitable to take forward. For each study selected through this process, a project proposal was developed and submitted to FWI leadership. Next Steps We have already begun planning for these studies. For the Satellite Imagery study, not only have we begun planning, but we have actually already completed field work—at the time of writing, data is being analyzed (we look forward to sharing findings from that study soon). As we progress through the year we may decide to include additional studies, but at this point in time the studies listed above represent the plans for the R&D Department in 2024. We believe this set of studies will provide key information for informing future plans for FWI. In keeping with our commitment to evidence-based decision making, we’ll await results of these studies before deciding how/if we can take the concepts forward.","text",10

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/priority-fish-species","Prioritizing Fish Species for Effective Welfare Improvements By Thomas Billington and Marco Cerqueira Humans farm an estimated 369 different species of finfish.Members of these species live in different conditions, are raised at various scales, and have distinctive requirements for their welfare. Thus, effective welfare improvements must consider: ​ Which fish groups should be prioritized(based on the opportunity for the largest positive effect) The welfare needs of the prioritized fish groups ​ This report will focus on these two considerations. We apply these within the context of Fish Welfare Initiative's work, highlighting six fish groups that we have prioritized: Catla (C​atla catla​), Striped Catfish (​Pangasianodon hypophthalmus), Rohu (L​abeo rohita​), Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus​), Milkfish (C​hanos chanos)​, and Torpedo-Shaped Catfish (​Clarias spp.​). Concerning the first point (which fish groups should be prioritized), we outline five criteria that we believe should be considered: sensitivity to negative stimuli, poor rearing conditions, number of fish raised, neglectedness, and tractability. Concerning the second point (the specific welfare needs), we have conducted literature reviews on the welfare requirements of all of our priority fish groups. These are presented below, as well as a discussion of the limitations of such reviews. Our aim within this report is to present Fish Welfare Initiative’s current perspective on prioritizing fish groups and to help start dialogue around this important topic. We hope this report can be informative, both directly for those interested in our priority fish groups and as a reference point for those beginning to work on fish welfare improvements.","text",2

Note that you will need to be signed in with a Google account in order to complete it. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ​ What will the hiring process be like? We haven’t completely finalized it yet, but we expect it will look something like having the following stages, with some candidates being eliminated at each stage: Initial screening application (~1 hour). Full application (CV, other questions; ~2 hours). Full test task (~6 hours). Interview 1 (~1.5 hours). Interview 2 (~1.5 hours). Possible work trial or in-person interview. Each stage will take 1–4 weeks in total, with an average of about 1.5 weeks per stage and our final decision probably being made 1–2 months after the initial application deadline. Candidates will be updated regularly throughout the process. ​ Why is the pay only listed for people living in India, and not for others? This is for two reasons: A) We are focusing our recruiting efforts on applicants in India, and thus expect to hire someone from there (though we’re open to hiring elsewhere), and B) we expect the pay elsewhere would significantly vary based on that particular country’s cost of living.","text",6
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/ops-lead","We want the best people though, and we expect to be able to pay location-specific compensation that is commensurate with the cost-of-living and any other specific needs our applicants may have.","text",7
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/ops-lead","​ I'm from <insert any country here>. Are you able to hire me? Yes. We are committed to hiring the best candidate for the job, regardless of nationality. Depending on the nationality of the successful candidate, we may hire them via an employer of record (EOR).

Can I really apply for this position? Yes, you can. We have a special place in our heart for applicants straight out of university (as much of our founding team was!). However, we expect to heavily favor applicants with more experience. ​ Will this job involve managing anyone? Not at first, though as our organization grows we will likely hire someone under you at some point. ​ What is it like to work at FWI? See our blog for ourrecent culture surveysfor unfiltered answers from our team. We think our culture is awesome, but it's not for everyone. ​ To what extent is FWI a place where I can grow my career? If we hire you under theAssociatedesignation, we would expect to promote you toLead, along with the greater responsibilities that entails, within a few years. After that, your responsibilities would continue to grow significantly as our organization does, though your job title probably won’t change. ​ I have another question about whether I should apply that isn’t listed here.

Objective Test the hypothesis that reduced excess feed will improve dissolved oxygen. Sub-objectives: Identify a feeding quantity that will fulfill Objective 1 and not negatively affect fish welfare or growth. Produce a case-study based impact evaluation of setting a baseline feed quantity as a change mechanism for volatile dissolved oxygen Test Overview Six to ten farms (ponds) will be chosen to participate in a test where half will be randomly assigned to control and the other half assigned to treatment. Treatment farms will receive a quantity of feed based on the body weight of the fish inside the pond (see below). This new feed rate will be in line with existing literature and expert opinion, which suggests a reduced quantity is better compared to normal farmer practice. Control ponds will see the farmer decide the feed quantity as they would ordinarily. This test is part of our process of assessing change mechanisms related to improving dissolved oxygen. It is built to be an early-stage examination of the efficacy of reduced excess feeding as a method of improving dissolved oxygen, as well as to test our hypothesis that poor dissolved oxygen is a product of high phytoplankton levels, which itself is a product of eutrophic conditions facilitated by nutrients from the feed.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/toc-strategy","FWI's New Theory of Change-Based Strategy Updated:Feb 2 Fish Welfare Initiative recently concluded our latestre-evaluation point. The idea behind these “reval points” is to divide our work between planning and execution, such that we have times specifically designated for each and neither interferes with the other. In this reval point, we decided upon anew 2-4 year strategyfor our work in India. However, in the immediate term, this strategy change amounts to a more of a mindset shift than a programming/intervention shift: We are still collaborating with corporate and government partners, and we are still running ourAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture. What is changing though iswhywe are doing these things: Previously, we did them because we thought that they were the best programs to run in terms of having a short-term impact. Now, largely driven by our uncertainty (e.g.) about whether we had chosen the right programming, we primarily do them because we want to validate a scalable theory of change for helping fish in India. On some level, this means that our mental energies right now are shifting more from scaling and helping fish in the short term to validating and helping fish in the long term. Though of course, we would always prefer to be scaling and helping more fish right now, we believe that this shift will best enable us to maximize our impact over the longer term. The below post discusses our new strategy, why we chose it, and what this means for our work going forwards.Feedbackis, as always, very welcome! FWI’s Previous Strategy: Choose, Implement, Scale Previously, FWI functioned more like how a typical organization would operate: We would choose goals and programming based on what seemed most promising, attempt to implement them, and then re-evaluate from there.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/toc-strategy","As we generally setambitious goalsand usually attained them, this approach was in many ways very useful: For instance, in 2021 it enabled us to improve the welfare in 58 fish farms, secure India’s first corporate commitment for fish, and improve the lives of roughly 400,000 fish (seemore). Our idea was that we broadly knew the right programming to do, and scaling was largely (though not completely) a matter of just applying more resources to replicate what we already had achieved at a smaller level.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/toc-strategy","However, we gradually began to think that this analysis was predicated on an overconfidence in our current work—a change was needed. Motivations Behind the Shift This shift in our strategy was motivated primarily by two reasons: First, our leadership team has had the lingering feeling that our previous approach andgoalswerenoton track to develop a scalable avenue for helping fish in India. Specifically, we realized that we were taking too many factors for granted, factors that need to function effectively if we are to scale and whose efficacy has been cast into greater question. In particular, Version 1 of our welfare standard isless impactfulthan we would like, and though we havelong had the intuitionthat government and corporate avenues will enable our scaleup, we have thus far lacked a validated model in our context for how exactly this would happen. And secondly, we have been thinking more explicitly about program development, particularly inspired by our consultantKaren Levy. Karen has previously consulted for GiveWell-recommended charities, charities whose programming and effectiveness inspire much of our vision. Her guidance has made us reflect more deliberately on what it will take to build a highly scalable and impactful program, and we felt that our previous strategy was inadequate to do so. FWI’s Revised Strategy: Develop and Validate a Scalable Theory of Change Our revised strategy is summed up by the following: Focus less on choosing and implementing whole programs that seem promising. Focus more on investigating the links in our best-guess theory of change and testing those, ideally by executing them on a smaller level. Scale only after the theory of change has been well validated. Be realistic about uncertainties where we have them. Ourcurrent, high-level hypothesisof a scalable theory of change for helping fish in India is the following:","text",4
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/toc-strategy","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6f025a_fae1a8dac0c443aab6d713d080c8fddb~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_49,h_10,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_auto/6f025a_fae1a8dac0c443aab6d713d080c8fddb~mv2.png","image",5
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/toc-strategy","Note that this is broadly how we were thinking before, even though weren't explicitly focused on validating it. We were also seriously neglecting the farmer behavior aspect—now, as probably should have been obvious to us at the time, it is abundantly clear that thinking deliberately about what farmers are and are not willing to do, and what incentives are required at each step of the way, is critical for empowering them to change. Zooming in to the lower level, in 2022 we specifically aim to investigate and validate each of these four links (two from institutions: one government, the other corporations), and then scale from there. These changes have been reflected in ourOKRsfor 2022, which now include a more deliberate focus on testing each link. For instance: Objective 2: Develop a subtheory of change of how welfare improvements influence fish welfare. OKR 2.1: Welfare standard version 2 developed and published. Objective 4: Develop a subtheory of change of how corporations influence farmers. OKR 4.1: Trial completed of a corporation selling higher welfare fish. (This means that at least one corporation is selling fish we consider to be higher welfare, an occurrence which would validate our hypothesis that we can get corporations to change their purchasing and standards behavior.) Accountability Metrics One potential downside of our new strategy is that, with its greater focus on preparing to scale later over immediately scaling now, we could be tempted to always push off scaling until some later tomorrow that may never arrive. Such infinite delays would be of course mistaken, as there are limits on how much uncertainty can be reduced—at some point you have learned what you can and the time for action arrives.","text",6
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/toc-strategy","We are addressing this 'risk of infinite knowledge building' in the following two ways: First, while we increase our focus on knowledge building we will also continue to help fish via our producer program, through which we alreadyestimatethat we have improved the lives of nearly 500K fish. We are at a stage now where we think we should almost always be having some impact, if only because there’s hardly a better way to learn about helping fish than by simply doing it.","text",7
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/toc-strategy","Second, we here and now make the following public predictions about our timelines. We ask that our supporters hold us to account for these, including withdrawing their support if we do not stay true to our word: We will strongly consider scaling down or pivoting our India operation, and publish a blog post explaining our reasoning, if either of the following occurs: By January 1, 2024, we have not published Version 2 of our India welfare standard. By January 1, 2025, we have not helped 500,000 fish with our Version 2 India standard.* Thank you for helping us help fish! *June 23, 2022 update: We lowered this latter lower bound tripwire from 1M to 500K. We did this because our current rate of helping fish is about500K per year,and we think if we were still at that rate in 2024-2025 (assuming the worst case scenario of only having the V2 standard in January 2024) we would likely think that was still a project worth running. *February 2, 2024 update: The first deadline has come and gone, so how did we do? In summary, a mixed bag: We didpublishour Version 2 Standard at the beginning of 2023. However, over several in-field tests it did not seem to be better than ourVersion 1 Standard(V1), so we have instead stuck with V1, with which we estimate that we havehelpedover 500,000 fish since the original publication of this post.Furthermore, we have recently pivoted to begin looking into alternative program structures to the current ARA intervention altogether—learn morehere. We consider this pivot, and with it the new leadership leading our R&D Department, to be in line with this original accountability metric. Recent Posts","text",8

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-update-our-main-initiative","Strategy Update: Our Main Initiative Updated:Dec 7, 2020 Over the past year, Fish Welfare Initiative has conducted farm visits and secondary research to identify the most promising ways to help farmed fish. We conclude thatpartnering with local NGOs to improve water quality for carp in Indiais the most promising option for our work. This post will discuss why we chose this focus and what it means for Fish Welfare Initiative moving forward. Early on in deciding Fish Welfare Initiative’s primary project, we defined four main questions needing to be addressed [1]. These were: In whichcountryshould we enable new work? On whichspeciesshould we focus? For whichwelfare improvementshould we advocate? Whatapproachshould we take? In the following, we explain our conclusions for each of these. Country: India For more information on fish welfare in India, seeFish Welfare Scoping Report: India. India is the second largest finfish producer globally [2]. It has a robust pre-established animal protection movement [3], but fish welfare still has much room for improvement. At the time of writing, we have conducted roughly 60 farm visits across India. From the 15 farmers we were able to survey, 67% stated that they were open to collaboration with an NGO to improve the health of their fish [4]. Farmers identified numerous welfare issues on their farms, and water quality appeared to be a significant welfare constraint. Most checked water quality irregularly [5]. Consequently, we believe that there is an opportunity in India to work collaboratively with farmers to increase fish welfare.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-update-our-main-initiative","Ultimately, Fish Welfare Initiative aims to facilitate institutional change. Charity Entrepreneurship found a success rate of 48% for governmental campaigns in India [6]. We are concerned by the issues with enforcement within India (although enforcement of animal protection laws is an issue globally [7]). We are also concerned by the low corporate engagement for Indian major carp farmers, who often sell to local markets [8]. Because of these limitations, Fish Welfare Initiative will likely need to employ a multi-armed approach (using some combination of legislative campaigning, corporate outreach, farmer training, promotion of certification schemes, and so on). We discuss this more below. With India having a pre-established animal protection movement, it was important for us to understand whether an additional organization would be useful, rather than repetitive. As such, we met with most of the major animal protection organizations in India to discuss this. Their sentiment was that another organization working specifically on fish welfare issues would be useful for their efforts. We recently hiredKarthik Pulugurthaas the Managing Director of our team in India. We are hiring for additional positions as well--if you are an Indian national, see ourjobs page. Note: If you represent an organization in India with which we have not already connected, please feel free toreach out. Species: Indian Major Carp For more information on how we came to this decision, see our reportPrioritizing Fish Species for Effective Welfare Improvements. Indian major carp are a group of species (catla, rohu, and mrigal) that are extremely common in Indian aquaculture [9]. According to our survey, they are often farmed without training or technological input [10]. Much of Indian major carp production is centralized in India [11]. This means that improvements to their welfare are less translatable to other countries.","text",4
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-update-our-main-initiative","However, it also presents exciting opportunities, such as changing legislation for 94% of global catla production with one successful governmental campaign [12]. Indian major carp are some of the most produced finfish species globally by tonnage (catla is 6th, rohu is 9th, and mrigal is 15th) [13].","text",5
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-update-our-main-initiative","Aquaculture literature often refers to Indian major carp as ""hardy"" [14]. As such, we may wonder whether it would be better to work on other species, as these more resilient species could be less affected by adverse welfare conditions. However, in the context of aquaculture literature, we believe that ""hardy"" tends to refer to a resilience to mortality (and perhaps moribundity). This definition does not necessarily align with being insensitive to negative stimuli, and we should thus be cautious not to conflate them. From our review of the existing research, it appears that catla and rohu are typical in their sensitivity to negative stimuli, both scoring 1.5/3 in ourweighted factor model[15]. It seems likely that Indian major carp are more sensitive to water quality issues than catfish, which is the next largest fish group produced in India [16,17]. It is also worth noting that many of the top-produced species in Asia are referred to as hardy [18]. Perhaps the most concerning aspect of working with Indian major carp is that there is a lack of scientifically established standards for safeguarding their welfare (for example, there are no established best practices for electrical stunning pre-slaughter). However, this lack of standards is an unfortunate reality for most of the globally top produced species. Semi-Intensive Aquaculture Facilities Another consideration with Indian major carp is their typical management intensity. Though there are no official statistics, it appears from our visits and discussions with experts that a large portion of Indian major carp farms are semi-intensive (i.e., fish gain nutrients from both the natural environment and supplementary feed [19]). It could be argued that intensive systems should be targeted, as there are generally more fish per farm. This high density means that fewer resources are needed per fish helped (although, semi-intensive farms still hold tens of thousands of individual fish at any given point [20]).","text",6
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-update-our-main-initiative","It can also seem intuitive that intensive systems have worse welfare conditions.","text",7
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-update-our-main-initiative","However, issues prevalent in intensive production tend to be less tractable than those in semi-intensive production (with some exceptions such as slaughter, which is likely more tractable on intensive farms). Intensive systems often have more technological inputs, higher levels of training, and access to better feed. The remaining welfare issues are either exceedingly difficult to solve (such as sea lice) or currently perceived as not beneficial for fish productivity (such as environmental enrichment). Since most research is aimed at fish productivity, there are very few non-productivity-based welfare interventions ready to be implemented, especially for the most produced species in Asia. Thus, welfare issues tend to be less tractable on intensive farms. It is also unclear as to whether welfare is worse for fish in intensive or semi-intensive systems overall. It is likely dependent on the specific species, farm system, management practices, stocking densities, and local water quality. Fish Welfare Initiative intends to bypass some of the issues of working with lower intensive farming systems by working with coalitions of farmers and NGOs that have existing connections with large numbers of farmers (such as those focused on sustainability and livelihoods). Another serious concern with focusing on semi-intensive farms is that these tend to be owned by lower-income households. As a result, effects on farm profitability can have serious human-welfare effects. Therefore, Fish Welfare Initiative will ensure that the farmers' well-being is secured throughout our work. Welfare Improvement: Water Quality For more information on how we came to this decision, see our reportFish Welfare Improvements in Aquaculture. Aquaculture literature frequently cites water quality as one of the main components of fish welfare [21]. It affects fish for the entirety of their lives, across all production systems.","text",8
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-update-our-main-initiative","It dramatically affects tertiary stress responses such as growth rates and is frequently the cause of mortalities [22]. It is also relatively controllable in pond systems, compared to other welfare issues such as disease.","text",9
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-update-our-main-initiative","Water quality appears to be a prevalent welfare issue for Indian major carp. From the survey we conducted of farmers in India, 25% said that they thought water quality was a major concern on their farm. 25% of farmers also said disease was a major concern, of which water quality is a necessary part of prevention.","text",10
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-update-our-main-initiative","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6f025a_c69510674f4d49fa9ff6aa330714f406~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_147,h_110,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_auto/6f025a_c69510674f4d49fa9ff6aa330714f406~mv2.jpg","image",11
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-update-our-main-initiative","However, we are concerned that increasing water quality could enable producers to increase stocking densities, thus resetting welfare by increasing the number of fish. As such, we will need to adopt broader strategies, such as incorporating a stocking density cap or establishing welfare as economically valuable (e.g., through labeling). It is still uncertain as to whether such strategies will be effective at retaining low stocking densities long-term, so this will be a focus of our field testing over the next year. There are numerous ways to improve the various aspects of water quality. Our current plan is threefold: producing training materials on best pond management practices which can be adopted by partnering NGOs; source funds which partnering NGOs can use to purchase aeration and water quality monitoring equipment (this could be from the state government, financiers, corporate social responsibility funds, and so on); and establish a stocking density caps through pressure from partnering NGOs, as well as farmer producer organizations, corporations, and eventually state governments and certification groups. However, this remains flexible, and will likely be updated over the course of the next year whilst we gain more knowledge on-the-ground. Approach: Collaborating With Producer-Supporting NGOs and Exploring Further Options During our approach research, it quickly became apparent that secondary research could not provide sufficient evidence upon which to base a large-scale decision. There is little precedent for welfare work for fish in India, and information accessible online is scarce. As such, we have hired a Managing Director to lead our work in India, Karthik Pulugurtha, who has experience working with producers to introduce organic production.","text",12
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-update-our-main-initiative","Through a process of targeted research and decision making, we decided to take a flexible approach, focusing primarily on helping producer-supporting NGOs commit to enabling better welfare standards across the farms with which they work.","text",13
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-update-our-main-initiative","In India, there exists many NGOs which assist farmers in building an income for themselves and making farming more sustainable [23]. These organizations have built relationships with farmer coalitions, as well as state governments, and use this leverage to improve farming practices through training, resource sharing, market interventions, and technological inputs. Some of the aims of these organizations intersect with FWI’s, as improving water quality decreases costs for farmers and increases environmental sustainability. Some of these NGOs have already shown interest in collaborating with us to improve water quality, and we are currently discussing conducting a pilot study with them. We believe that collaborating with established producer-supporting NGOS early on is an important step towards increasing visibility for fish welfare issues, and we expect these collaborations to positively impact hundreds of thousands of fish and be a strong launching point for other approaches such as influencing policy. However, we are uncertain of partnering with NGOs as a long-term strategy, and so over 2021 we will also be exploring other options, such as corporate and governmental outreach, in order to gain more information as to how to best scale up fish welfare work. Although much more research will be needed, this concludes the research phase of Fish Welfare Initiative. Our focus is now implementation. Endnotes King-Nobles, H. (2020).New Strategy Updates.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/our-fish-welfare-improvements-in-india","Our Welfare Improvements in India Updated:Feb 10, 2021 Over the past few months, Fish Welfare Initiative has been meeting with farmers and other stakeholders across the state of Andhra Pradesh, India, where we plan to focus our work for the next few years. This post outlines what we believe are the main welfare improvements that are required in Andhra Pradesh to begin safeguarding the welfare of fish. These will be the main focus within our pilot study, and, assuming strong results, will likely be our focus as we initiate welfare improvements across the state. We believe these improvements strike close to the optimum balance between having a large positive effect on fish welfare whilst still being achievable (albeit ambitious) for Fish Welfare Initiative and ourpartnering NGOsto implement. The following are the broad categories of welfare improvements that Fish Welfare Initiative will help implement. 1. Adhere to best pond management practices relating to welfare. Effective management is a core part of ensuring the welfare of fish is protected. All across India (as in most other places globally), there is a lack of management practices tailored towards ensuring the welfare of the fish. Most producers have not received any training in aquaculture, much less any with a focus on fish welfare. [1] As a result, many best management practices are either inconsistently applied or completely unknown to producers here. Many of these improvements are relatively easy for producers to apply. For example, broadcasting feed broadly across the pond’s surface will help ensure all fish get to feed. Another example is making sure that producers’ hands are wet before handling fish, which reduces damage to the fish’s skin. [2] Small improvements such as these, when applied regularly and in-tandem, constitute a major boost to the welfare of fish. Producers must be conscious of fish welfare in all management decisions and apply scientific research to best care for their fish.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/our-fish-welfare-improvements-in-india","Fish Welfare Initiative is currently building training materials to educate producers in these best management practices. These will be made available to producers both through booklets and videos, as well as in-person training events that will be joint-hosted by Fish Welfare Initiative and our partnering NGOs.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/our-fish-welfare-improvements-in-india","2. Maintain consistently high water quality. Water quality is frequently cited as one of the most important aspects of maintaining good fish welfare, [3, 4, 5] including in our report discussing welfare improvements for Indian Major Carp. [6] However, early tests seem to indicate that water quality is often low in Andhra Pradesh. [7] Water quality should be monitored at least once daily, and necessary equipment and contingency plans must be in place to ensure that water quality issues can be effectively managed. Water quality parameters should be kept at levels that are informed by the available research for the species being farmed. Fish Welfare Initiative is currently conducting primary research to help define the best water quality conditions for Indian major carp (the most common species in Andhra Pradesh). From this, we will set the acceptable water quality parameters that producers will adhere to. 3. Ensure healthy stocking densities. High stocking densities cause physical injury, as well as increasing disease rates, water quality degradation, social stress, and the environmental toll of the system. Producers need to ensure that stocking densities are kept at a level that is not damaging to the fish. Often, welfare improvements also increase the carrying capacity of a given system, allowing producers to push their stocking densities even further at the cost of fish welfare and environmental sustainability. As such, it is imperative that producers commit to healthy stocking densities before other welfare improvements are introduced to their system, in order to lock in the benefits for fish and the environment. Fish Welfare Initiative is also conducting primary research into stocking densities and their effects on fish welfare.

Wagas, Haven King-Nobles, and Marco Cerqueira Interested in putting research into action? We encourage any organization or industry interested in engaging with fish welfare in the Philippines tocontact us. We are able to offer consultation in the development of fish welfare standards, and support in the form of training, endorsement, and overseas trips. ​ Executive Summary Aquaculture production in the Philippines has been on an upward trend since the 1980s, increasing by over 400% from 1980 to 2018. In 2017, the country was reported as having the 3rd largest aquaculture industry in Southeast Asia, and the 7th largest in the world. Despite this projected growth, there is currently very little work being done for the welfare of farmed fish in the Philippines. A 3-month scoping study was initiated by Fish Welfare Initiative to collect data on the current culture systems in the country and, from these findings, assess the welfare status of farmed fishes. Data was gathered through a series of farm interviews/visits and a review of available literature/studies relevant to Philippine aquaculture and animal welfare. Listed below are the main findings of this work: Finfish culture systems. Milkfish and tilapia are the main finfish species cultured in the country. The most common culture system used for rearing finfish are brackish water ponds, marine water cages, and freshwater cages. The sizes of farms are highly varied, ranging from small-scale producers utilizing backyard ponds to large-scale producers utilizing farms as large as 150 hectares. Market information. Finfish produced by aquaculture are largely consumed locally. Harvests from small-scale producers are usually sold in local wet markets, while bigger farms with larger production capacities sell their harvest to institutional buyers such as grocery stores and processors.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/philippines-scoping","Currently, there is no significant demand for high-welfare fish in the domestic market. There are a handful of businesses that advocate and sell higher welfare fish, but the steep prices of these products make them inaccessible to most end-consumers.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/philippines-scoping","Welfare issues. Data from farm visits/interviews (n=13) reveal the following welfare-related concerns: (1) a lack of water quality monitoring systems, (2) a lack of access to veterinary care, (3) the use of inhumane slaughter procedures, (4) the non-certification of farms, and (5) a lack of training opportunities for farmers. These concerns are most common among the small- to medium-scale producers that sell their produce to local wet markets. Nonetheless, the majority of the farms have expressed their willingness to collaborate with any institution to help them improve their culture systems and the living conditions of their fish. There are many opportunities for fish welfare work in the Philippines. The presence of a strong institutional support for sustainable aquaculture practices from both the government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can serve as a good foundation for welfare work to begin in the country. Our recommendations highlight the need for a collaborative approach to starting welfare work in the country, taking into consideration the viewpoints and concerns of multiple stakeholders in the aquaculture sector (farmers, retailers, end-consumers, government, and NGOs). ​ ​ Project funded with support from World Animal Protection courtesy of a grant from the Open Philanthropy Project.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/supplementary-feed-test","Results of Our Small-Scale, Supplementary Feeding Test Updated:Feb 21 As part of our evolvingWelfare Standardand our continuous efforts to better understand fish welfare considerations in Andhra Pradesh, India, we periodically test and assess our welfare recommendations. The main goal with such assessments is to identify the best avenues for improving the lives of farmed fish throughreliable,scalable, andpracticalinterventions in fish farms. In this post, we detail the results of one small-scale test we recently conducted—an investigation of how fishes’ growth and the water quality in farms may be affected by reducing supplemental feeding. This update is designed to inform our stakeholders of our approach to understanding the welfare of fishes better as well as to share our progress. Summary Over a period of 4 months, we ran a small-scale test (1 control farm, 1 treatment farm) to evaluate whether reduced supplemental feed would positively impact fish welfare compared to pre-existing feeding methods (where fishes are typically fed as much as they will eat, or overfed). Our hypothesis was: Reduced supplemental feedwould lead toreduced phytoplankton levelsandimproved dissolved oxygen levelsin the test farm compared to the control, and the growth rates of fishes will remain unaffected. Here, any feed provided by farmers was considered “supplemental,” in recognition of the natural food sources found in the farm ecosystem (namely, phytoplankton and zooplankton). The results of this experiment showed that reduced supplemental feed led to: Reduced phytoplankton levels. Unchanged dissolved oxygen levels. Unchanged fish growth. That is, the treatment (reduced supplemental feed) works to reduce phytoplankton levels. However, not every farm may need this treatment depending on its initial phytoplankton levels. For instance, our treatment farm had low phytoplankton levels before the test and may not qualify to receive this treatment in normal circumstances.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/supplementary-feed-test","We are considering, then, that this intervention can be valuable but will need to be paired with an assessment system in order to only target farms with phytoplankton-related issues.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/supplementary-feed-test","Due to our limited sample size (2 farms in total) and the presence of other confounding factors (detailed below), the results of this test must be further verified before they are applied on the ground. Our Motivation and Rationale The Relationship Between Dissolved Oxygen and Phytoplankton Levels Dissolved oxygen (DO) refers to the amount of oxygen that is available within the water for fishes to breathe. In farms with Indian major carp (the main species we focus on in our India work), DO levels are often too low, too high, or erratic, and this causes fishes to suffer. A maincausefor erratic DO levels has been found to beuncontrolled phytoplankton. For a deeper explanation, please see theBackgroundsection of this recent post. Further, our observations and experience working in Andhra Pradesh, India, pointed to overfeeding being a common occurrence in fish farms—Farmers overfeed fishes, leading to release of high levels of nutrients in the water, intended to nourish fishes but wholly unutilized by them. Instead, these excess nutrients feed phytoplankton, causing their populations to swell. Our hypothesis is that, were supplemental feed quantities to better match fishes’ needs (rather than exceeding them), the fishes would not be negatively affected (as they are not using the excess nutrients anyway) and phytoplankton populations would decrease (as there is a lower supply of nutrients to support their proliferation). This would, in turn, improve fishes’ lives by creating more stable oxygen levels with fewer highs and lows.","text",4

Selecting and Preparing Farms for the Test Two farms, comparable in size, location, and prior conditions, in Bantumilli, Andhra Pradesh, India, were chosen—both farms were owned by the same farmer and had a similar cultivation history. Both farms also already contained water. We captured fishes that were in the farms and released them into a local canal.Often, native fishes from the canal will enter the pond systems through water inflow. In order to ensure that there were no native fishes competing for food, we used cast nets to capture the fishes and release them back into the canal. We repeated the cast netting process until no more fishes were in the water. Following this, we added sanitizer into the water; we then pumped in additional water until a depth of 6–7 feet was attained. One farm of1.84 acreswas considered the control farm and the other, of1.62 acres, was considered the treatment farm.","text",6

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/supplementary-feed-test","Stocking the Farms with Fishes Typically, farmers purchase juvenile fishes for their farms from what is called a “rearing pond.” For our test, FWI confirmed that the juvenile fishes were not diseased or otherwise in poor health or welfare, prior to the farmer purchasing the fish. Juvenile rohu (Labeo rohita) and catla (Catla catla) fishes were transferred from the “rearing pond” to the test farms as per the predesigned stocking densities of 2700 fishes per acre. Feeding Methods Fish were fed exclusively de-oiled rice bran, using the bag-feeding method. This is a typical system for Indian major carp where supplemental feed is placed in sack-like bags with holes at the bottom; the bags are suspended across a farm with each bag partially submerged in the water. Fishes nibble at the feed through the holes, as seen in the following video. Test Conditions The test ran from November 2022 through March 2023. The feed quantity in thetreatmentfarm (with reduced feeding) was decided using a weight-based design from our Fish Welfare Specialist, detailed in theAppendix. The feed quantity for ourcontrolfarm was decided using the “blind” feeding method, where supplemental feed is introduced up to the point that any increase would result in not all the feed being eaten by fishes—this is the method typically implemented by farmers. Where there were uncertainties with the blind feeding method, the farmer who owned these farms and anotherAlliance for Responsible Aquaculturefarmer were consulted. Data Collection Farms were observed twice daily—once in the morning (between 6:30 and 8:30 AM) and once in the evening (between 04:30 and 06:30 PM). The full raw data can be foundhere. External and Confounding Factors Our test results may have been affected by the following external factors, details of which are provided in theAppendix.","text",8

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/supplementary-feed-test","Disease outbreaksin both our farms:Although we were implementing disinfection protocols, diseases are very common in Andhra Pradesh carp farming. Fortunately, this outbreak was fairly mild, as we were able to identify and treat the disease quickly Application of fertilizers and sanitizersduring the test to both farms, albeit in equal quantities at the same time. Results and Implications The treatment farm was, on average, given 17% less supplemental feed (though it varied some over time) than the control farm. On average, the treatment farm had 22% less ofChlorophyll a—a naturally-occurring pigment that is a strong signal of phytoplankton population density—than the control farm (with a standard deviation of 39%). Our analyst ran statistical models on our data in order to directly assess whether the hypothesis holds (“reduced supplemental feed would lead to better phytoplankton and dissolved oxygen levels than the control, and growth rates will be the same”). These models took into account differences in morning and evening measurements as well as the different seasonal periods (November 2022–March 2023). These were the main takeaways: The levels ofChlorophyll aandphycocyanin, which are strong proxies for phytoplankton levels, were reduced in the treatment farm. Fishes’ weight showed no significant correlation with the treatment, implying that treatment had no effect on their growth. Turbidity positively correlated with treatment, which was an unexpected result. DO levels showed no significant correlation with treatment, implying that even though the treatment reduced phytoplankton levels, this did not translate into improved DO levels.

Conclusions These results suggest that thetreatment worked to reduce phytoplanktonlevels, but thatthe farms did not need this. Considering the small sample size and theconfounding instances, these results are extremely tentative and should only be seen as an indicator of the correlations. However, they do seem to be indicating that phytoplankton levels are reduced by reducing supplemental feeding through a weight-based feeding system. The results of this test reinforce three ideas: Reducing supplemental feed (through a weight-based feeding system) is likely a strong intervention for farms with phytoplankton overpopulation. Proactive improvements applied to all farms indiscriminately may have negative effects on some farms. Feed management practices are best coupled with fertilization protocols, in order to ensure that they do not exacerbate pre-existing problems For a detailed discussion of the findings, please see theAppendix. Next Steps This test has increased our interest in a system of evaluating farms for phytoplankton problems and then assigning a weight-based feeding strategy (with periodic phytoplankton evaluations) to those farms that have phytoplankton-related issues.","text",15

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/india-scoping","Fish Welfare Scoping Report: India By Marco Cerqueira, Haven King-Nobles, Jennifer-Justine Kirsch, and Koushik Raghavan Aquaculture is the fastest growing food production sector in the world, with roughly 73 to 180 billion farmed fish alive at any given point. Nevertheless, little concern has thus far been given to their welfare. Fish are often kept under poor environmental conditions and in high densities, fed for fast growth, and slaughtered via inhumane methods. These welfare issues are now becoming exacerbated and entrenched as production increases and intensifies. However, an increasing number of both academic and advocacy organizations, including Fish Welfare Initiative, are now recognizing that welfare is a guiding principle for responsible aquaculture. This report discusses the welfare of farmed fish in India, a country with an estimated 3 to 14 billion finfish alive in aquaculture, the second largest quantity of cultured finfish per country in the world. To better understand Indian aquaculture, we first reviewed FAO data, industry data, and other studies relevant to fish welfare. Secondly, we visited and surveyed 17 farms in India in March and July of 2020. Our main findings are the following: In India, farmed finfish are largely consumed domestically: only 26% of aquaculture exports are finfish. Domestically consumed fish are often sold in informal markets with little to no government regulations. Although there is increasing centralization of the seafood market, top-down changes still appear challenging. The primary aquaculture systems in India are extensive and semi-intensive freshwater ponds. In 2018, 86% of fish producers operated freshwater systems. More intensive farming systems, such as Recirculatory Aquaculture Systems (RAS) and raceways, are becoming increasingly popular. In 2018, Indian Major Carp accounted for 73% of finfish production, and catfish for 10%.","text",2
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/india-scoping","The proportion of certified aquaculture facilities in India is still very low, although the Global Aquaculture Alliance Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP), the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC), and Friend of the Sea (FoS) certification schemes are all either already active in India or have indicated interest in being so. The vast majority of facilities certified by BAP and ASC farm or process shrimp.","text",3
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/india-scoping","In our field visits and farm surveys (n=17), the production issues reported by the largest number of farmers were water quality, diseases and infections, and lack of qualified veterinary care or appropriate medicines. The majority of farmers surveyed expressed an interest in future NGO collaboration. Pre-slaughter stunning was absent in every facility we visited. We conclude with a list of recommendations for future fish welfare work in India. Specifically, we suggest that organizations demonstrate the connection between fish welfare and other issues and include a focus on enforcement, amongst other recommendations. For specific welfare guidelines and on-the-farm recommendations for Indian Major Carp, see our upcoming Fish Welfare Improvements in Aquaculture report. We encourage any organization or industry interested in engaging with fish welfare in India tocontact us. We are available to provide consultation, training in fish welfare improvements, and access to funding. Lastly, we would like to thank the numerous people in India who made this report possible.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/priority-species","Prioritizing Fish Species for Effective Welfare Improvements By Thomas Billington and Marco Cerqueira Humans farm an estimated 369 different species of finfish.Members of these species live in different conditions, are raised at various scales, and have distinctive requirements for their welfare. Thus, effective welfare improvements must consider: ​ Which fish groups should be prioritized(based on the opportunity for the largest positive effect) The welfare needs of the prioritized fish groups ​ This report will focus on these two considerations. We apply these within the context of Fish Welfare Initiative's work, highlighting six fish groups that we have prioritized: Catla (C​atla catla​), Striped Catfish (​Pangasianodon hypophthalmus), Rohu (L​abeo rohita​), Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus​), Milkfish (C​hanos chanos)​, and Torpedo-Shaped Catfish (​Clarias spp.​). Concerning the first point (which fish groups should be prioritized), we outline five criteria that we believe should be considered: sensitivity to negative stimuli, poor rearing conditions, number of fish raised, neglectedness, and tractability. Concerning the second point (the specific welfare needs), we have conducted literature reviews on the welfare requirements of all of our priority fish groups. These are presented below, as well as a discussion of the limitations of such reviews. Our aim within this report is to present Fish Welfare Initiative’s current perspective on prioritizing fish groups and to help start dialogue around this important topic. We hope this report can be informative, both directly for those interested in our priority fish groups and as a reference point for those beginning to work on fish welfare improvements.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/do-fish-feel-pain","Do fish feel pain? Updated:Apr 19, 2021 The idea that fish can’t feel pain goes deep in history. The common belief was that the biology of a fish was far too simple to process pain. But anatomically, fish are certainly not “too simple” to feel pain. There are two key criteria animals must fill to be considered capable of experiencing pain, according tothis reviewon assessing animal pain. First, they must respond to a potentially painful event differently than they would to a pain-free stimulus. Second, the animal should change their normal behaviors based on the painful event. Numerous studies have shown fish to meet both of these criteria.","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/do-fish-feel-pain","In one experiment, zebrafish were put in a tank with two different chambers; one was stimulating, with vegetation and objects to explore, and the other was barren. A group of zebrafish were injected with saline water, and another group with painful acetic acid. Both groups chose the stimulating chamber. This was to be expected: fish typically prefer chambers with stimulation. However, when a painkiller was dissolved in the barren chamber, the fish injected with acid chose to swim in the less preferred yet pain-relieving barren chamber. The fish injected with saline stayed in the preferred chamber. Jonathan Balcombe, author ofWhat a Fish Knows,stressed the experiment’s significance in proving that fish can feel pain. He toldSeafoodSourcethat the experiment shows fish are willing to pay a cost, or go into a chamber they normally avoid, to get relief from their pain.","text",4

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/do-fish-feel-pain","Lynne Sneddon, a leading researcher on fish pain, explained that when humans are in pain, we become distracted and do other tasks less well. And fish experiencing pain are no different. “Fish consumed by pain do not respond to fear-causing situations and do not show normal anti-predator behaviour,” Sneddon toldThe Guardian. Yet when Sneddon’s team administered drugs such as aspirin, lidocaine, and morphine, the drugs made the pain symptoms disappear. “If fish did not experience pain, then analgesic drugs would have no effect.""Another studyshowed that fish learn to avoid electric shocks usually in one or a few trials, showing their capacity to shift their typical behaviors in response to experienced pain. When considering all of the empirical evidence together, these studies show fish fulfill the criteria for animal pain: they respond to potentially painful events differently than they would an unpainful one, and they change their normal behaviors based on the painful event. If fish can suffer – why don’t they receive the same welfare protections as other animals? Jeremy Bentham, who developed the theory ofutilitarianism, wrote that the most important question to ask is not, “Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?” In a 2014 interview on BBC Newsnight, the late Penn State University biologist Victoria Braithwaite and Bertie Armstrong, head of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation, discussed fish pain and welfare. Armstrong argued that “the balance of scientific evidence is that fish do not feel pain as we do.” Braithwaite said that’s beside the point. We cannot determine whether dogs, cats, chickens, cattle or lab animals feel the same pain as humans, yet these animals have been given increasingly humane treatment and legal protections because of their proven ability to suffer. As more research shows thatfish can feel pain, Braithwaite believed that better standards for fish welfare will be increasingly important, too.","text",6
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/do-fish-feel-pain","“More and more people are willing to accept the facts,” Braithwaite said. “Fish do feel pain. It’s likely different from what humans feel, but it is still a kind of pain.”","text",7
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/do-fish-feel-pain","The evidence that fish are capable of feeling pain is enough reason to treat them humanely. As the public around the world is increasingly concerned about the well-being of other farm animals like pigs and chickens, fish should not be forgotten. Recent Posts","text",8

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/ara-vision","Our Vision for Helping Hundreds of Millions of Fishes Updated:Jul 24, 2023 Fish Welfare Initiative (FWI) has been working in India for over two years now. Most of our programming has focused on farmer engagement through theAlliance for Responsible Aquaculture (ARA), andwe expectthis to be our main program area in the future. The ARA currently has 72 fish farms committed to ourwelfare standard, and we have helped over1 million fisheson these farms. The relative success of this farmer-centric work fuels our ambition to reach many more fishes in the future. We believe that we can achieve this by scaling up the ARA. This blog post outlines our tentative plan for doing so. How We Currently Help Fishes By joining the ARA, farmers commit to reduced stocking densities and to maintaining water quality in required ranges in their farms. Our field staff visit farms monthly to take water quality measurements and recommend corrective actions if any parameter(s) is/are outside these ranges.As such, our program currently relies on a combination of proactive (stocking density limit) and reactive welfare improvements (water quality corrective actions).","text",2

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/ara-vision","Testing Scale-Up in 2023 A New Welfare Standard Our main bottleneck for scaling this year is finalizing animproved Welfare Standardand, specifically, identifying more targeted welfare improvements to control dissolved oxygen issues in ARA farms. Our Welfare Standard team is working tirelessly to publish an updated standard and has made significant progress over the past months. We expect to have a new proposed standard by September; in preparation for this, we will start adding more farms to the ARA in August. Operational Improvements Over the past months, we continuously improved our operations. The ARA team now has rigorous program controls, performance indicators, and improved onboarding protocols. These systems will help us onboard new staff efficiently and set and track clear expectations for their work. Adding Fish Farms As we develop our new Welfare Standard, we will add 50 more farms in the third quarter to identify potential bottlenecks for a more intense scale-up in the fourth quarter. Our goal for the remainder of 2023 is to add 150 new fish farms that will implement our Welfare Standard. We will do so primarily by inviting further farmers in the villages we work to join the ARA and potentially by partnering with local organizations to expand our reach beyond these existing networks. Scaling Up in 2024 and Beyond Adding 150 farms in 2023 will give us sufficient insights and time to identify how best to add staff and farmers to the ARA. In 2024, we will focus on adding more farms (probably 300–400) and increasing this number in subsequent years. We think that our current model lends itself well to such scale-up because: Most fish farmers are interested in improving welfare and have been eager to join the ARA because it can help them reduce diseases and mortalities. We have identified various avenues for adding large clusters of farmers at once. By visiting ARA fish farms, we can verify that fishes are actually being helped.","text",4
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/ara-vision","Costs for equipment are moderate, with the potential to be lowered further.","text",5
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/ara-vision","We require mostly field staff for regular measurements whose salaries are affordable even in high numbers. Such scale-up is primarily facilitated by finding sufficient farmers and having them commit to the ARA. The biggest bottleneck will be hiring sufficient staff to run the ARA and securing enough financial resources to support these staff and the equipment we need for regular water quality measurements. We created aGuestimate modelto get a better sense of these costs and expect that we can reach a cost-effectiveness of about 130 fishes per dollar with ca. $1 million programming costs. Reaching this level of cost-effectiveness will likely take us 7–8 years. The Case for Farmer Engagement Work Given the theoretical cost-effectiveness of this approach, we think farmer work in lower/middle-income country contexts like India has been historically undervalued by the animal movement, and that it is an avenue for impact that our movement should explore further. In addition to the numbers, there are other arguments in support of farmer work as well: It gives us significant leverage with local governments and industry stakeholders, in ways that we expect will pay off by later, for instance, enabling policy change. Farmer-centric work also enables us to collaboratively build models for better farming systems in the industry—in our case, ones that are less chemically and suffering-intensive, and where practices are improved and mortality rates lowered. Challenges As we grow our program, we experience various bottlenecks hindering our ability to scale extensively. Equipment The Issue Our water quality measurement devices are expensive, yet our welfare standard relies on them to identify poor water quality and suggest corrective actions. How We Address It We based our cost-effectiveness estimates on the assumption of needing these devices long-term and their cost didn't significantly tamper our cost-effectiveness.","text",6
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/ara-vision","At the same time, we are researching cheaper alternatives to reduce programming costs further. We are currently ~35% certain that one of these cheaper alternatives will work out.","text",7
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/ara-vision","Hiring The Issue We have experienced continuous difficulty hiring for mid-level management roles within our ARA ground team. These managers will be essential to coordinate the field staff collecting water quality data. How We Address It We are currently revamping our hiring and outreach processes and expect to attract more talent in the future. All details of ourjob openingsare available on our website. Partnership Reliance The Issue Much of our later stage scale-up (2024 onwards) could rely on partnerships with local organizations. As with any collaboration, balancing interests is a challenge to overcome and ensure sufficient farmers commit to our Welfare Standard. How We Address It Several people on our team are exploring other avenues of recruiting new farmers. One of these avenues is to hire temporary mobilizers who will reach out to farmers in new regions and catalyze initial ARA sign-up meetings. We will then invite these gatherings of farmers to join the ARA together, thus reducing the time cost of individual outreach.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/1-million-fishes","Fish farmers in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India, with Nagaraju Bijja, our Program Coordinator. To measure the number of lives our interventions improved, we use a set of criteria (seeHow We Define Fish Helped) that, while imperfect, serve as an indicator of our program execution and impact. They involve a rather subjective, case-by-case approach with limitations we are working to resolve. Signaling this uncertainty, we consider the fishes we work for onlypotentiallyhelped. We continue to work towardbetter, more impactful, and more consistent welfare standardsthat can increase our certainty in the effectiveness and impact of our programs. A Typical Intervention: Improving Dissolved Oxygen Levels Stressors like poor water quality can rapidly deteriorate the living environment of fishes. Among the many determiners of water quality in a fish farm, dissolved oxygen stood out to us as a welfare concern withthe most potential to immediately impact the lives of fishes. On an intuitive level, this makes perfect sense—the oxygen fishes breathe is absorbed by their gills from the water; by bettering the water they live in, we can improve the quality of lives of fishes. But the effects of too-low or too-high dissolved oxygen are not always conspicuous to the naked eye. This was, however, not the case on a recent field visit. In a farm in Kolleru, Andhra Pradesh, India, a routine measurement revealed that the dissolved oxygen level was very low (0.6 mg/L). The fish were forced to rise to the surface to gasp for the air they couldn’t find in the water column. This behavior, called gasping, isevidence of their suffering. Low dissolved oxygen levels causing fishes to gasp at the water surface of a farm in Andhra Pradesh, India. The fishes expose their mouths (seen as dark spots on the surface) to air frequently, resulting in visible activity and ripples in the water.","text",6
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/1-million-fishes","We immediately recommended, as per ourcorrective action protocols, that the farmer exchange (replace) some of his farm water and add a low quantity of hydrogen peroxide (which breaks down to release oxygen into the water) to improve the dissolved oxygen levels.","text",7
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/1-million-fishes","Within 2 days, dissolved oxygen levels in the farm increased to 3.2 mg/L—anacceptable valuefor mornings. The farmer also did not observe any more fish gasping for air. Without our intervention, the farmer may not have taken the necessary corrective actions and inadvertently prolonged the suffering of these fishes. An aerator deployed in a fish farm in Eluru, Andhra Pradesh, India. Our corrective actions direct farmers to make the most effective use of equipment like aerators to maintain adequate dissolved oxygen levels in farms. Moving Forward Into 2023 In 2023, weexpect to help another 1.5 million individualsby increasing our certainty in the impact of our programming, and then scaling. To achieve this, we plan to test and validate ourVersion 2 Welfare Standardduring the first half of 2023. If this proceeds as planned, we will roll out Version 2 through theARAand introduce it fully by end-2023 while also enrolling 150 additional farms into the ARA. Though much uncertainty remains, we hope and expect that our understanding of the challenges and our impact for fishes will continue to grow.

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/ara-fish-welfare","Chandu, our Data Collector, measures water quality parameters at an Alliance for Responsible Aquaculture farm in Andhra Pradesh, India. We announced the formation of the Alliance of Responsible Aquaculture (ARA) in June last year. Since then, this first-of-its-kind coalition of farmers, corporations, and NGOs has grown to include 74 aquaculture farms, 3 corporations, and 2 farmer producer organizations. Through the ARA, we have potentially improved more than540,000fish lives. Reviewing our progress in the last year, we’ve confirmed 3 things: There is enormous scope for India to be kinder to the animals farmed in aquatic systems. Improving fish welfare in aquaculture increases business resilience while reducing fish suffering. Fish welfare aligns with India’s government initiatives to develop sustainable and responsible aquaculture practices. In this post, we will explore the ARA’s positioning and scope with each of the points above. ARA Functioning and the Scope of Fish Welfare in India Aquaculture is a high-risk venture for most farmers in India. Aquafarms are highly subject to external factors such as weather conditions and calamities like floods, which often result in massive mortalities. With factors that can be controlled, farmers often lack the resources to do so. Leading the ARA helped us discover: Most farmers are unaware of the correct stocking densities that prevent overcrowding and enable the growth of healthy, more stress-free fish. Low oxygen levels plague aquaculture farmers in India. Most lack the right equipment to maintain sufficient oxygen levels or face regular power shortages and high electricity rates. Farmers rely on laboratories that take hours, sometimes days, to provide them with water quality readings. Farmers often are not aware of best feed management practices, contributing to poor water quality. These factors contribute to substantial losses for farmers and colossal fish suffering.","text",4
"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/ara-fish-welfare","Aproducer prerequisitefor joining the ARA is to stock fish at the correct densities. The 73 farms we work with stock no more than3000 fish per acre. We are consistently working with ARA farms on maintaining high water quality. We do this by conducting fortnightly water tests and prescribing corrective actions when necessary.","text",5

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/ara-fish-welfare","Farmer Ajaneyulu engaged in conversation with FWI India’s Managing Director, Karthik Pulugurtha. Stressors like poor water quality and high stocking densities subject fishes toimmune system dysfunction, leaving them vulnerable to disease. In India, diseases in farmed freshwater fishlead to10-15 % production loss due to mortality and low growth rate. Like acquiring water quality readings, disease treatment is sparse and time-consuming. More often than not, farmers resort to the use of drugs and chemicals to prevent disease. We believe that maintaining optimum water quality parameters can reduce farmers’ costs incurred towards treating disease. Moreover, we arecurrently running teststo optimize feed management practices to assist water quality management. Through our work, ARA farmers are increasingly learning about the benefits of fish welfare improvements, including implementing welfare to mitigate disease. Enabling them to function withAquaculture Best Practicescarries great potential to improve billions of fish lives.","text",9

"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/ara-fish-welfare","Disease prevention through welfare improvements, as opposed to the use of drugs and chemicals, benefits farmers, the environment, and public health. Fish Welfare as a Vehicle for Sustainability Untreated wastewater from aquaculture is toxic, degrades the environment, and can disrupt ecosystems. It also significantlycontributestoalgal bloomsandocean dead zones. Fish welfare improvements prevent crowding and poor feeding systems, reducing the amount of feed suspended in water and minimizing harmful wastewater generation. These improvements also promote better feed conversion ratios while reducing aggression and stress in fish. Less stressed fish have better immune functions, decreasing the need for antimicrobials that would otherwise end up in the surrounding environment. Indian policy initiatives like thePradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana(PMMSY) clearly signal the need for aquaculture to develop sustainably and responsibly. Through the functioning of the ARA, we are regularly engaging government agencies with fish welfare as a vehicle for sustainable, reliable, and kinder aquaculture practices.","text",11
