"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/rilarvimerseafood","MER Seafood is a corporate shrimp farm operating in Honduras.","text",13
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/rilarvimerseafood","In March 2017, Rilarvi Hatchery by MER Seafood began to phase out eyestalk ablation in their female broodstock. There were periods of time in the following years when the hatchery did a test with a small percentage of ablated females. However, the test did not considerably improve production. Since January 2021, MER Seafood farms have been growing 100% non-ablation shrimp. MER Seafood is proud to guarantee that 100% of their supply chain does not practice eyestalk ablation.","text",14
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/rilarvimerseafood","This move helped MER Seafood come closer to a more humane approach in shrimp production and its aim to improve animal welfare and quality of products, meet the requirements of international certification standards, and ensure a path to 100%  sustainable shrimp farming.","text",15

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","This article will detail all stages of the shrimp supply chain, from Inputs, to Farming, to Trading, to Processing, to Exporting/Importing, and finally Distribution.","text",13
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Inputs","text",14
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Shrimps are either caught in the wild or bred in hatcheries, then transported to the farm.","text",15
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Wild Post-Larvae (PL)- PL refers to fully grown shrimps who have grown past their larval stage. In some countries, PL are caught from the wild by specialised fishers during peak seasons and sold to farmers.","text",16
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Broodstock- This refers to shrimps that have been conditioned to ensure they produce the maximum number of fry (baby shrimps). Some countries import their broodstock, while some have their own hatcheries (and some do both).","text",17
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Hatcheries- Many countries have professional hatcheries where broodstock are kept and bred. On a daily basis, the shrimps that have eggs are selected and taken to ‘de-egging’ tanks, where the eggs are removed, cleaned, treated and stocked in plastic boxes. After hatching, larvae are often placed in incubators to increase survival rate for around 15-21 days. Some countries have separate Nurseries where the fry are transported to and nursed until they can be sold.","text",18
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Transport (to farm)- Transport to nurseries or farms is typically done by road or, in remote areas, by boat. Shrimps are packed in oxygenated bags. The mortality rate during transport can be high.","text",19
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Feed- The most common types of feeds are nursery, grower and finisher feeds. It can be purchased from local feed companies, often supplied as pellets that contain fish meal (fish byproducts or bycatch), grains and additives, but can also include corn, soybean, squid liver, binding agents, as well as artemia and crumble feed. Feed is often balanced for different life stages.","text",20
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Chemicals and Medicines- Several drugs, such as probiotics, are used to prevent or treat disease outbreaks. Many unlicensed manufacturers however can be found on the market. Antibiotic use in Aquaculture is banned in the US and EU, however they are still used in many countries that export to these countries. Additionally some chemical fertilizers are used to stimulate algae growth in ponds. Sometimes entire containers of imported shrimps are rejected due to food safety inspections due to the use of antibiotics.","text",21
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Farming","text",22
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Also known as Aquaculture, shrimps grow for three to six months before slaughter.","text",23
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Farms range from small-scale family enterprises to large corporations. Individual ponds range between 0.2 to 1.6 hectares, but multiple ponds next to each other can create farms that exceed 70 hectares.","text",24
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","In most polyculture (more than one species) systems, shrimps eat the excess feeds and waste produced by the fish. Monoculture (shrimps only) farms tend to use pellet feeds 3 to 4 times a day.","text",25

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Many thanks toFresh Studiofor providing this illustration of the different farming production models.","text",27
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Extensive- These farms are small-scale, ranging from three to five hectares, stocking 4-6 shrimps per square metre and harvesting 300-450kgs of shrimps per hectare. They typically use a natural tide to restock water and bring in feed. Extensive farming is seasonal based on the natural life cycles of shrimps.Semi-intensive- These farms have higher stocking rates than Extensive farms, stocking 20-60 shrimps per square metre and harvesting 9-12 tonnes of shrimps per hectare per year. Rather than relying on wild seedlings as in Extensive farming, Semi-Intensive farms use captive breeding to produce new shrimps.Intensive- These farms have higher stocking rates than Semi-Intensive farms, stocking 60-200 shrimps per square metre and harvesting 6-15 tonnes of shrimps per hectare per year. Intensive farming is practiced by both individual households and corporate farms, with corporate farms ranging up to 1000 hectares in size.Super-intensive- These farms have the highest stocking rates of shrimps, stocking 200-500 shrimps per square metre, and harvesting between 40-80 tonnes of shrimps per hectare per crop. This type of farming is practiced by vertically integrated companies and farms are completely isolated from surroundings, with ponds/tanks located in a greenhouse.","text",28
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Trading","text",29
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Shrimps are harvested and transported to factories, often with the help of intermediaries.Harvest- Shrimps are harvested when they are around three to six months old. Small farms harvest manually by using nets (known as a seine), or by forcing shrimps to leave the pond through a gate and trapping them. Bigger farmers use mechanical systems to lift the shrimps onshore. Alternatively, the pond is drained, and the shrimps are then collected in nets. Once onshore, they are put in plastic boxes with ice slurry (water and ice) where shrimps face a slow death.","text",30
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Transport (to factory)- As with the transport to farms, this depends on location, but in most cases the boxes of shrimps are transported by truck. Though in some cases this can be by boat. Typically, factories arrange transport while farmers arrange the harvest.","text",31
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Agents- Many small scale farmers (especially geographically isolated farmers) don’t work directly with processing factories and instead work with intermediaries, agents and traders. They provide financial or other services (such as collecting, auctioning or transport) to farmers and assist factories with grading shrimps, pre-processing and transporting.","text",32
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Processing","text",33
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","At processing plants, shrimps are assessed, classified, processed, bagged and frozen.Fully integrated producers (i.e. producers who own every step of production) often dominate the processing sector. On arrival at the processing plant, shrimps are washed and cleaned. Antioxidant products to prevent melanization are also applied at this stage. They are then assessed for colour and quality and then classified (either by hand or machine). The shrimps may then be further processed, i.e. via peeling, deheading, deveining, cutting or precooking. Once they have been processed this way, they are packed in bags and boxes and then frozen, ready for export.","text",34

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Shrimps are inspected, certified, and then transported by truck to sea and land ports.Certifications- Shrimps are commonly kept in cold storage for final quality inspection, often to meet the requirements of buyers and legal regulations, such as Health Certificates, which accompany the shipment to its destination. If loaded into containers at the processing plant, then customs formalities are handled here.","text",36
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Transport (to ports)- Once shrimps are ready they are packed into containers and then transported on cooler trucks to sea and land ports.  If loaded into containers at the port, then customs formalities are handled here.","text",37
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/the-shrimp-supply-chain","Agents- Many countries and buyers use agents who negotiate contracts, perform quality control at the processing plants (and where the containers are packed) and coordinate the purchase of shrimps from various suppliers.","text",38

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/post/shrimp-welfare-project-partners-with-thong-thuan-seafood-and-young-s-by-sofina","Shrimp Welfare Project(SWP) is thrilled to announce a significant agreement with two major seafood companies,Thong Thuan SeafoodandYoung’sbySofina, to improve the welfare of farmed shrimps. This agreement represents another major step forward to promote ethical shrimp farming practices.","text",12
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/post/shrimp-welfare-project-partners-with-thong-thuan-seafood-and-young-s-by-sofina","Thong Thuan Seafood, a leading Vietnamese shrimp producer known for its innovative approach to aquaculture and for its high-quality shrimp hatcheries across Vietnam, has agreed to implement electrical stunning technology—provided by SWP viaOptimar—into its production chain. This method is widely recognised as the most humane way to slaughter shrimps, significantly reducing stress and suffering.","text",13
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/post/shrimp-welfare-project-partners-with-thong-thuan-seafood-and-young-s-by-sofina","At the same time,Young's—a major UK seafood supplier with a strong commitment to sustainability and comprehensive CSR initiatives—has pledged to prioritise sourcing from Thong Thuan's electrically stunned shrimp stock. In fact, under Young’s Fish for Life initiative, they have already made significant strides in crustacean welfare. Beyond working to increase the percentage of shrimps that are electrically stunned, they also require all UK brown crabs and lobsters to be electrically stunned before slaughter.","text",14
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/post/shrimp-welfare-project-partners-with-thong-thuan-seafood-and-young-s-by-sofina","Additionally,both companies have committed to maintaining high welfare standards throughout their operations, including optimal water quality, responsible feeding practices, and regular health monitoring. This holistic approach ensures that shrimp welfare is prioritised at every stage of production. SWP will provide ongoing support, including training, auditing, and assistance in developing comprehensive welfare practices. This collaborative effort sets a new benchmark for the industry and demonstrates that commercial viability and ethical practices can go hand in hand.","text",15

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","​","text",14
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","While many environmental conditions and farming practices could plausibly affect the welfare of shrimps, little research has been done to assess which factors most affect shrimp welfare.","text",15
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","This report aims to assess the importance of various factors for the welfare of farmed shrimps, with a particular focus onLitopenaeus vannamei(also known asPenaeus vannamei, or whiteleg shrimp), due to the scale and intensity of farming (~171-405 billion globally per annum). Where evidence is scarce, we extend our research to other shrimps, other decapods, or even other aquatic animals. Further research into the most significant factors and practices affecting farmed shrimp welfare is needed.","text",16
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","Conclusions from our review are summarised below:","text",17
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","Eyestalk Ablation: Shrimps demonstrate aversive behavioural responses to eyestalk ablation, and applying anaesthesia before ablation has therapeutic effects. We believe this is strongly indicative that eyestalk ablation is a welfare concern.","text",18
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","Disease: Infectious diseases cause significant mortality events. This is likely to both cause suffering prior to death and increase the total number of shrimps who are farmed and experience suffering.","text",19
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","Stunning and Slaughter: Current slaughter practices (asphyxiation or immersion in ice slurry) are likely to be inhumane. While evidence on the optimal slaughter method for shrimps is limited, electrical stunning appears to be the most promising method to effectively stun and kill shrimps.","text",20
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","​","text",21
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","Stocking Density: There is strong experimental evidence to suggest that reductions in stocking density indirectly improve welfare by improving water quality, reducing disease, and increasing survival. There is also some tentative evidence that stocking density directly impacts shrimp behaviour and measurable stress biomarkers (e.g. serotonin).","text",22
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","Environmental Enrichment (EE): Environmental enrichments (e.g. feeding methods that mimic natural behaviours, hiding sites, different tank shapes and colours, plants, substrates, and sediments) probably improve shrimp survival, but there is little evidence on their impact on shrimp stress or behaviour. There is moderately strong evidence that physical enrichment (such as physical structure, plant, and substrate) improves welfare for aquatic animals, including crustaceans.","text",23
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","Transport and Handling: Poor transport and handling practices are likely to lead to physical injury and stress, although research is limited on the welfare effects of current shrimp farming practices.","text",24
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","Food: While some decapods appear resilient to lack of food, inadequate nutrition leads to risk of non-infectious disease and may lead to aggressive and abnormal behaviour.","text",25
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","Water Quality","text",26
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","Dissolved Oxygen (DO): Several studies indicate that insufficient DO levels increase mortality, which is likely to be preceded by suffering due to poor physical condition. Optimal DO levels may also help prevent aggressive behaviour.","text",27
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","Un-ionised ammonia: High concentrations of un-ionised ammonia (NH3) are toxic for shrimps and are harmful for shrimp welfare. High un-ionised ammonia hinders the immune response and leads to high mortality rates.","text",28
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","pH: Deviations from optimal pH have detrimental effects on health, immunity, and susceptibility to disease. Sudden fluctuations (within the optimal pH range) may also be harmful based on our conversations with farmers and aquaculture specialists, though we were unable to find consistent supporting evidence in the academic literature.","text",29
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","Temperature: Shrimps are adaptive to fluctuations in water temperature. However, high temperatures are highly likely to be harmful for welfare, as the water retains less oxygen, toxic ammonia increases, and survival worsens. While small deviations below optimal temperature may be less harmful, very low temperatures also harm physical health and lead to mortality.","text",30
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","Salinity: While it is likely that extreme salinity levels or fluctuations are harmful for welfare and survival, the experimental evidence does not consistently demonstrate harmful effects for small deviations from the recommended salinity range.","text",31
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","The table below outlines how confident we are that a particular welfare factor is important for shrimp welfare. We judge a welfare factor to be important if small to medium improvements in this factor would reduce harm to the animal(1). Our confidence levels range from very high to low(2). Higher confidence on this scale indicates that there is stronger evidence in the importance of this factor for shrimp welfare. Lower confidence on this scale does not necessarily imply that the welfare factor is less important, rather that the evidence is either limited or mixed.","text",32
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","​","text",33
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","(1) This refers to small to medium improvements from a realistic level of living conditions, i.e. the conditions typically seen on semi-intensive shrimp farms, such as a stocking density of 25-35 shrimps/m2. Since extreme levels of any welfare factor are likely to be both extremely harmful and atypical on farms, it is less informative to consider improvements from extreme levels.","text",34
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report","(2)  In practice, we assigned at least medium confidence to all the welfare factors we investigated.","text",35

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/vietnam-scoping-report","Approximately 440billion shrimps are farmed each year, with this number set to increase with the intensification of global aquaculture production due to the 'blue revolution'.Little concern has been given to shrimp welfare, with many of these animals often suffering from poor water quality, rampant disease, inhumane slaughter methods, and practices such as eyestalk ablation (crushing or cutting off at least one of the eyestalks of female shrimps to induce rapid reproduction).","text",13

In general, semi-intensive, intensive and super-intensive farms managed water quality well, with basic water quality parameters falling within the required and/or optimal ranges. Although very few farms monitored water quality on a daily basis, the farmers who owned intensive and super-intensive farms were very confident that they maintained water quality well.","text",19

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/vietnam-scoping-report","Regardingslaughter methods, shrimps were either put in a cold water tank and transported to processing plants alive, or put in ice slurry right after harvesting and weighing.

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/why-stop-using-eyestalk-ablation","Eyestalk ablation (ESA) involves one or more of the animal’s eyestalks being removed through crushing, cutting, burning, or tying it off. This increases spawning and shortens the maturation time. However, it disturbs the health and welfare of breeding animals and their offspring. Also, ESA affects the quality of the animals and their survival. This then affects production and can lead to lower financial profits for farmers.","text",12

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/why-stop-using-eyestalk-ablation","Scientists label decapods (including shrimps and prawns) assentient beings. ‘Sentience’ means that the animals can feel pain and distress. It also means they have negative and positive feelings. Researchers discovered that when shrimps are subjected to ESA, they try to escape it. They also flick their tails and rub their eye area. When the wounds are covered or medicine is given, the shrimps calm down. This suggests that the ablation caused them pain and distress. Any practice that causes or might cause pain, fear, and or distress should be minimised if not eliminated.","text",14

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/why-stop-using-eyestalk-ablation","Producers should consider using closed-cycle breeding as a beneficial alternative to ESA.

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/why-stop-using-eyestalk-ablation","But it is very important to maintain the welfare of closed breeding cycle animals. Breeding animals should be used for a limited number of generations. To achieve similar or better production without ESA, producers should focus on the following: providing breeding animals with good quality nutrition during the pre-growth stage; maintaining a sex ratio of 1:2 male to female instead of the usual 1:1; and creating optimal environmental conditions.","text",42

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/consumerreport","Executive Summary","text",13
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/consumerreport","​","text",14
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/consumerreport","This exploratory study examined consumer attitudes towards the moral worth and welfare of shrimps and willingness to pay more for higher welfare animal products. We surveyed 393 individuals obtained through the survey platform provider Prolific. Participants were residents of the UK or major EU countries. There was an almost even split between men and women and the majority of participants were omnivorous (see Appendix Afor detailed demographic information).","text",15
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/consumerreport","The study examined basic perceptions of shrimp welfare, but it nevertheless provides a clear preliminary picture of consumer opinion in this area. We tested participants' initial perceptions of shrimp welfare and sentience through a series of questions. They were then shown a visualinfographicwith brief overviews of evidence for sentience in shrimps and five common welfare practices. The participants were then asked the same questions again.","text",16
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/consumerreport","Perhaps surprisingly, given the as yet limited public debate on the welfare of farmed shrimps in particular, there was initially a notable consensus of concern for shrimps. 67% said that shrimps either “absolutely” or “probably” deserve not to suffer. Only 5% said an outright “no” to giving any consideration towards the animals. When it came to testing participants' concern over specific welfare factors, although many clearly felt they lacked information, there was also a deeming of the welfare practices problematic to varying extents even before fully understanding them. 44%-84% said that the five welfare practices were problematic in some way, ranging from a “small” to a “huge” problem. The largest grouping fell under “I don’t know enough [about this welfare factor to choose]” in four out of five questions. 70% indicated a willingness to pay between 5% more and more than 20% more for higher welfare shrimps, with a majority of 27% choosing 10% more in price.","text",17
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/consumerreport","​","text",18
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/consumerreport","After participants saw our brief informationalinfographic, there were clear and significant increases in moral consideration and the deeming of every current welfare practice as significantly more problematic. Increases in the five factors being regarded as “a huge problem” ranged from 71% to 426%. 66% now said shrimps are “absolutely” worthy of moral consideration and being spared from suffering. There was a combined 228% in those indicating willingness to pay 15% more, 20% more, or more than 20% more for higher welfare shrimps. The largest grouping however remained at paying 10% more with 19% of the total participants.","text",19
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/consumerreport","We want to stress the basic nature of the infographic (please see theAppendicesfor survey materials), and furthermore that this simple overview can create such clear changes in consumer perceptions.","text",20
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/consumerreport","The results from this study serve as a preliminary observation of consumer attitudes towards shrimp welfare and higher price tolerance. It may be helpful for retailers looking to anticipate evolving consumer preferences by adapting their supply chain commitments and product positioning. Further research will provide a more detailed analysis in this area as consumer awareness of welfare in aquatic animals grows.","text",21

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/alternativeshrimpmarket","​","text",14
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/alternativeshrimpmarket","Investment in the global alternative seafood market has grown dramatically in recent years. Consumers are increasing their consumption of alternative seafood for several reasons, including marine animal welfare, environment, health, and transparency. Seafood companies have an incentive to diversify their portfolio with a new revenue stream, and several major seafood producers have already partnered with alternative shrimp companies.","text",15
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/alternativeshrimpmarket","​","text",16
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/alternativeshrimpmarket","While the alternative shrimp market is growing, there are several barriers to large-scale consumer uptake, including high production costs, product formulation, consumer acceptance and obtaining regulatory approvals. Possible solutions include open access R&D, scaling up production of animal-free omega-3 fatty acids, and guaranteed offtake contracts (purchase commitments). SWP may have a role facilitating coordination between important market players, such as farming communities who could produce key ingredients, seafood companies, researchers, and governments.","text",17
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/alternativeshrimpmarket","​","text",18
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/alternativeshrimpmarket","Projections of cultivated meat and seafood production in 2050 are similar to actual plant-based production today, which suggests plant-based shrimp is more likely to reach large-scale consumer uptake over this timeframe. However, this may be reversed in the long-run (likely 2050 onwards), given the taste and nutritional advantages of cultivated shrimp, if production costs can be reduced. Cultivated shrimp also has several potential advantages over other cultivated meats, such as its ability to be cultivated at lower temperatures.","text",19

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimpact","Currently, we don’t assess the extent of impact. The count of shrimps helped is not based on the level of help provided.

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","What is Sentience?","text",15
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","Sentience (from the Latinsentire, to feel) is the capacity to have feelings[1]. These may include feelings such as pleasure or pain. But these aren’t the only experiences that matter. An individual can have other positive or negative experiences such as warmth, boredom, contentment, frustration or joy*. A simple way to capture this idea is to ask: “Does it feel like something to be this individual?”. Sentience differs from self-awareness, which refers to awareness of awareness - or rather, awareness of your own sentience**[2].","text",16
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","​","text",17
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","The crux of disagreement around whether an animal is sentient (or can feel pain) often isn't around the facts (i.e. whether an animal can experience these positive or negative states), but rather around our understanding of the words we are using. For example, someone might claim that an animal can't feel pain because that person associates the word pain with human pain, and they are emphasising the difference between what a human experiences and what an non-human experiences. But note that this isn’t a disagreement in the facts, but around the meanings of words.","text",18
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","*Other examples include an individual suffering through severe hunger or thirst, or suffering emotionally (such as being separated from their mother).","text",19
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","**It has also been argued that being self-aware may reduce the severity of suffering[21]. For example, a human can think about or discuss an emotional state, leading to the realisation that negative consequences may not be as bad as they feared, or that if they were suffering from something such as food poisoning, they know it will likely end after a day or two.","text",20
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","The Precautionary Principle","text",21
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","It’s worth discussing degrees and likelihood of sentience. Often the conversation around sentience is framed as if sentience is an “on/off switch”, but sentience may vary significantly among species (i.e. sentience in a shrimp is likely very different from sentience in a human, which in turn is likely very different from sentience in an octopus).","text",22
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","Additionally, we don’t need to be in a position to state with complete certainty whether an animal is sentient. Instead we should take into account how likely we think an animal is sentient. If there is a non-negligible chance that an animal is sentient, we should consider their interests when deciding how to treat them. In other words, we don't need to be 100% sure an animal is sentient to believe they are morally relevant, and to take actions to prevent their suffering.","text",23

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","Norway- Legal protection for decapods was recognised by the Norwegian Animal Welfare Act 2010[7]including regulations on killing, confining and transport.

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","There is relatively strong evidence that larger decapod crustaceans (i.e. true crabs) are sentient[9]. Unfortunately compared to larger decapods, penaeid shrimps have barely been studied[1]. It is important, however, that protection of decapods should not be restricted in a way that privileges the most intensively studied laboratory species. Existing legislation, for example, extends protection to all vertebrates using evidence based on generalisations from intensively studied species (such as rats) to relevant species[1].","text",43

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","Let’s have a look at how shrimps respond in relation to indicators of sentience. Unfortunately, studies of P. vannamei tend to focus on feeding behaviour and production practices such as stocking densities and mating. Therefore, research on motivational trade-offs, and information processing that go beyond habituation and sensitisation are currently missing[10]. The lack of this research is due to an information gap, and does not reflect absence of this phenomena.","text",45

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","Possession of nociceptors- Let's say you accidentally touch a hot stove. Instantly, you will withdraw your hand from the stove.  A simple circuit of neurons saved your hand from a noxious stimulus (the hot stove) and prevented you from a burn.  This is referred to as nociception, named after nociceptors, the sensory receptors that detect the noxious stimuli.","text",48
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","Possession of integrative brain regions- Being able to integrate information from multiple different sensory sources.","text",49
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","Connections between nociceptors and integrative brain regions- Neural pathways connecting nociceptors to the brain (though it should be noted that the nervous system is organised very differently in elongated species such as shrimps, compared to compact species, such as crabs).","text",50
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","Responses affected by potential local anaesthetics or analgesics- If you have been to the dentist, you have probably been applied a substance to numb an area of your mouth so that the dentist can perform a procedure that otherwise would be uncomfortable or painful. That’s an anaesthetic, a substance that creates a lack of feeling. When used locally, anaesthetics reduce any sensation (not only pain) in a target area, while the individual remains conscious. If an animal responds differently to stimuli while under the influence of anaesthetics, this suggests the lack of feeling is mitigating an animal's experience of pain or distress.","text",51
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","Motivational trade-offs that show a balancing of threat against opportunity for reward- An animal can make a decision, like avoiding negative stimuli, such as an electric shock, rather than experience a positive stimuli (i.e. their actions cannot be explained by reflexes alone).","text",52
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","Flexible self-protective behaviours in response to injury and threat- Guarding, grooming or otherwise tending to an injured body part are protective behaviours[11]. These are typically long term responses to injury, seen over periods of hours and days rather than seconds and minutes. In humans, protective behaviour is often controlled by the conscious feeling of pain, such as avoiding using an injured limb.","text",53
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","Associative learning that goes beyond habituation and sensitisation- If an animal can experience something, learn from it, and then make different decisions in the future, it provides good evidence of sentience.","text",54

For example, extreme temperature changes[14][15]or injections of noxious heavy metals[16](e.g. copper and mercury) lead to the release of the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH).

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient","If an injured animal reacts similarly to a human to a local anaesthetic, we may conclude that the substance reduces sensation in that area.

Thus, it is crucial to explore and understand the industry to identify and implement welfare interventions effectively. This report discusses an overview of the shrimp paste industry and highlights welfare issues and challenges to determine opportunities for welfare interventions. We take Vietnam, one of the largest producers, as a case study to gain a deeper understanding of the industry.","text",14
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimppasteandanimalwelfare","Shrimp paste is an integral condiment for Southeast Asian cuisine, valued for its unique umami flavor and nutritional properties, including vital omega-3 fatty acids. The production process primarily involves sun-drying, grinding, and fermentingAcetesshrimps, which varies in duration and technique across countries. While deeply rooted in cultural heritage and social practices, shrimp paste is also a significant commercial product, with villages selling locally and countries like the US, UK, Canada, and Australia importing from top-producing countries like Thailand and Indonesia.","text",15
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimppasteandanimalwelfare","The industry provides livelihood opportunities for small coastal communities, where activities are divided among families with roles in catching, trading, and processing.

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","​","text",13
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","When animal welfare isn’t taken into consideration in shrimp production systems, the results include poor health, more disease, need for antibiotic use, higher mortality, environmental and ecosystem impacts, and ultimately lower resource efficiency and productivity. Looking after the welfare of shrimps can mitigate many of the most pressing issues created by the industry as it stands today.","text",14
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","Water Pollution","text",15
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","Oxygen and ammonia levels, temperature, salinity and pH are key to the welfare of all aquatic animals, including shrimps[1]. Poor water quality can lead not only to compromised immune systems in shrimps[1](and in extreme cases, to death by suffocation or poisoning[2]), but also to the contamination of nearby bodies of water, as well as salinization and acidification of the soil[3]. Water pollution can cause large spillover events if best management practices are not followed. For example, algal blooms can deplete oxygen levels in the water[4]and produce harmful toxins that may kill animals and cause human illness[5].","text",16
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","Disease Prevention","text",17
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","Diseases that exist within the normal microflora of shrimps can thrive under high stocking densities (with density depending on the intensity of the production method[6]), enabling pathogenic outbreaks[7].","text",18
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","Poor shrimp health can often lead to inefficient production. For example, diseased shrimps have higher mortality rates and reduced yields[8]. Keeping suffering and stress to a minimum protects animal welfare while also ensuring high quality shrimps[9]. Since farmed shrimps are ultimately raised for human consumption, diseases in shrimps directly (and negatively) affect food safety. Benchmark, an aquaculture research institute, has identified disease as one of the top sustainability challenges facing the shrimp industry today[10].","text",19
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","​","text",20
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","In order to combat bacterial diseases suffered by shrimps, antibiotics are used extensively in shrimp farming[11]. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics to stop diseases promotes the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria[12]. This has the potential to hinder the overall effectiveness of antibiotics in the future, which could affect not only shrimps but also humans and other animals. One of the best ways to minimize the need for antibiotics is to rear shrimps under greater welfare conditions, promoting better immune systems, thereby lowering the susceptibility of disease outbreaks[13].","text",21
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","Ecosystems","text",22
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","Many consumers shift their consumption from wild-caught aquatic animals to those raised in aquaculture, under the assumption that such a shift will eliminate the impact that their diet has on aquatic biodiversity. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Feed for carnivore and omnivore aquatic animals such as shrimps still requires a significant amount of wild fish in its composition[14].","text",23
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","​","text",24
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","Another way in which shrimp farming can hurt the environment is by spreading diseases in their surrounding areas. The densely stocked ponds, teeming with immunocompromised shrimps are the ideal breeding grounds for pathogens and parasites to flourish. This, combined with poor biosecurity measures, can wreak havoc on the local wildlife as wastewater is discharged back into the rivers. On the contrary, in small quantities (for example from less intensive operations), water effluent from shrimp farms can be beneficial due to its nutrient content and organic load[15].","text",25
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","​","text",26
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","Many shrimps are wild-caught using bottom trawlers[16]. This process includes trawling for animals to feed shrimp with fish meal. Bottom trawling releases a gigaton of carbon dioxide from the seafloor each year (almost as much as the emissions of the whole African continent in 2010)[17], leads to a significant amount of bycatch[18], and results in ghost fishing[19].","text",27
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","​","text",28
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","Shrimp farms are frequently built on the site of mangrove forests which are cut down to make way for ponds, which causes significant carbon losses. The carbon intensity of shrimp farming from deforested mangroves is 10 times greater than that of beef grown in deforested Amazonian rainforest[20].","text",29

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","Local communities often rely on fisheries for employment, food and health. However, poor management and unsustainable fishing can result in overfishing and excessive bycatch[18]. This threatens the future viability of family businesses and employment opportunities, while worsening food insecurity and public health issues.","text",31
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","​","text",32
"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","Local and indigenous communities rely on mangrove forests for food, income and other resources. Shrimp farms can privatise and destroy this resource and when communities fight back, repercussions can be tragic, including loss of livelihoods, rapes and murders[21]. Shrimp processing facilities[22]and fishing for shrimp feed[23]are practices that have both included human trafficking and slave-like working conditions.","text",33

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-and-sustainability","Finally, people increasingly care about animal welfare and where their food comes from[24]. Raising higher welfare shrimps enables producers to remain viable in a changing marketplace and more sustainable seafood can sell for a price premium, increasing revenue[25].","text",35

"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org","Risk of disease- Diseases that exist within the normal microflora of shrimps can thrive under high stocking densities, enabling pathogenic outbreaks. This is detrimental not only to the farmed shrimps but can cause large spillover events if best management practices are not followed. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics to stop diseases promotes the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Part of the solution in this case is prevention through best welfare practices.","text",15

Therefore, eliminating this practice is in the best interest of shrimps but also of the shrimp farming industry.","text",19
