HAP initiated and passed a law in 2017 banning training instruments of pain thereby barring animal circuses from ever performing within city limits again. Puppy mills As the “Puppy Mill Capital of the East”, Pennsylvania has some of the worst-of-the-worst puppy mills in the country.  HAP’s multi-faceted approach to ending puppy mill misery included passing the first retail-sales ban of mill-bred animals in PA, which bans pet stores from selling puppy mill dogs.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/environmental-stewardship/reimagine-takeout/","The Case for Compostable Restaurant takeout containers in Pittsburgh are often made with single-use plastic—these containers are almost never recyclable. Compostable containers are a viable alternative, but the compost culture in Pittsburgh is still underdeveloped. Very few businesses use compostable containers, and there are not enough places that accept them for composting. Composting centers are integral for effective decomposition. Compostables not properly disposed of are worse than single-use plastic. Get the Most from Compost Take-out containers are not recyclable.CAlmost none of the standard takeout containers used in Pittsburgh are recyclable. Even containers that appear to be paper often contain a plastic lining inside. Because these containers come in contact with food, they are also covered in contaminants such as oil, which harm the recycling process for other items. There are alternatives.Compostable takeout containers are a great alternative to plastic containers. While compostables still tend to be slightly more expensive than some plastic containers, thankfully more options are becoming increasingly available. Costs are dropping as demand rises. Composting cuts plastic and fights climate change.Compostable containers break down in less than one year, and they biodegrade into materials suitable for reintegration into soil and gardens. Proper composting also cuts down greenhouse gases. What is HAPpening? HAP’s Reimagine Takeout initiative is working to help local restaurants replace harmful plastic takeout containers with compostable or reusable alternatives. We’ve created an online resource to promote composting, encourage compostable alternatives to plastic takeout containers, and feature restaurants that use compostable containers. We partnered with a local restaurant, Onion Maiden, in a pilot program for composting awareness. They use compostable containers for their takeout, and agreed to include a card with a link to Reimagine Takeout.","text",6

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/victories/bullhook-plus-ban/","Bullhook Plus Ban In December 2017, Humane Action Pittsburgh successfully created and worked towards the passage of theBullhook Plus Banthat prohibits the use of bullhooks, electric prods, shocking devices, hacksaws, ankuses, baseball bats, axe handles, pitchforks, whips, sticks, muzzles, and other instruments capable of inflicting pain, intimidating, or threatening pain for the purpose of controlling the behavior of wild or exotic animals, including elephants, lions, tigers, bears, and monkeys, in the city of Pittsburgh. As a result of the ban, all circuses, including the Shrine Circus, have ceased coming to Pittsburgh and have no future events planned in the city. The Pittsburgh Zoo is not exempt from the ordinance. This ordinance was the first in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to ban these instruments. Although circuses with animal acts are not expressly prohibited, they are unable to perform without using these brutal tools. In April 2018,HAP worked with the Borough of Sharpsburgon an ordinance that bans all traveling exotic animal performances. Sharpsburg was the first in Pennsylvania to do so, and HAP worked with Bellevue to do the same shortly after. Other towns in PA have since followed the precedent set by Pittsburgh, Sharpsburg, and Bellevue, and HAP hopes to bring this ordinance to other communities in our area, which will give momentum to astate billbanning these acts!","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/victories/heart-of-a-hero/","At Humane Action Pittsburgh, we are always looking for ways to reduce the suffering of animals, and when HAP’s President, Brian Bonsteel, learned that the City of Pittsburgh had a Climate Action Plan initiative to “reduce meat consumption 50% by 2030,” he knew we had an opportunity and a moral obligation to help. Even if their initial motivation was for environmental sustainability, we knew that we would share compelling information about the health benefits of reducing meat consumption, and everyone would get their needs met, including the community at large. HAP’s Executive Director, Natalie Ahwesh, and HAP’s Advisory Counsil member, Christin Bummer, contacted the Human Resources Manager for the City of Pittsburgh and found an instant ally. Richard Butler knew the city would save money on future healthcare expenses, but more than that, he had a genuine interest in getting the City of Pittsburgh healthier in every way possible. Our plant-based suggestions fell right in line, and he was on board. Knowing that the great majority of the City of Pittsburgh’s employees are public safety workers, we had a hunch that Rip Esselstyn and his Engine2 team would be a great tie-in. Rip is a plant-based former fire-fighter from Austin, Texas, and we worked closely with his team for 9 months to create what would become the Heart of a Hero Challenge. One hundred City employees registered to take the challenge to make themselves heart-attack-proof simply by changing what’s on their plate – vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes. Rip and his team flew out to Pittsburgh for three separate events – a Kick-off, a movie screening ofThe Game Changersand the Big Reveal. We were thrilled with how the city embraced the challenge and tackled it head-on. The results speak for themselves. On average, participants dropped their cholesterol 22 points in just seven days! Many reported increased energy, enjoyment of the food, and an intention to stick with it after the initial challenge!","text",5

The only negative feedback we’ve gotten so far is that it wasn’t open to the public! Rest assured, we’re already working on a way to include WAY more people next year!

HAP worked to get this legislation across the finish line for two years in a massive win for PA wildlife–and human residents alike. HAP educated house representatives and the public on the importance of the resolution, sending correspondence, meeting with elected officials, creating and disseminating educational literature, and even making a trip to Harrisburg, the state capital. ‌ We are proud of our excellent relationships with Pennsylvania’s government leaders and sincerely appreciate their commitment to protecting animals and the environment. We would also like to say a special “Thank you” to Representative Jason Ortitay, the lead Republican on the resolution and HAP’s 2023Legislator of the Yearhonoree.","text",3

Leading health experts agreed that a plant-based diet is the ONLY diet proven to reverse heart disease, type II diabetes, and even potentially stave off cancer. It is the single best thing we could do for ourselves and our families — and for the responsible treatment of animals and our environment. 2024 Developed by HAP, Get Healthy Pittsburgh! aims to transform Pittsburgh into a city where well-being knows no boundaries. The program caters to all demographics, irrespective of age or income level. In 2024, HAP was thrilled to be able to offer GHP on a pay-what-you-can model for the first time, accepting participants even if they could pay nothing.The program challenges participants to try a whole food plant-based diet for one week to measure how their health improved.  Not only is this diet best for humans, but for animals and the planet as well. Under the guidance of Dr. Sandra Sobel from Summon Health, participants experienced a transformative journey. The kick-off event, led by Dr. Sobel, set the stage for success, introducing attendees to the program’s pillars and offering a tantalizing taste of plant-based delights. The program’s holistic approach included before-and-after biometric screenings, daily coaching on balanced meals, efficient food preparation, time-efficient physical activities, and more. The ‘reveal party’ became a celebration of accomplishments, showcasing tangible health improvements achieved in just one week.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/victories/restricting-wild-bird-trapping-selling/","Restricting Wild Bird Trapping & Selling In 2015, Pittsburgh City Council passedOrdinance No. 36, which prohibited the harm of any wild bird and allowed any individual who possessed proper permits and/or licenses to capture wild birds. Although the Ordinance was enacted with the intention of protecting the city’s wild birds, its vague language allowed those without the proper expertise to trap birds, resulting in injury to the birds and danger to the public. Since its passage, Humane Action Pittsburgh has been advocating for the strengthening of the 2015 Ordinance. Through collaboration with HAP, City Councilor Bruce Kraus introduced an amendment to the ordinance on February 21, 2020. On March 4, 2020, Pittsburgh City Council passed anamendmentthat 1) restricts who can trap wild birds in the city and under what conditions; and 2) prohibits the sale of all native wild and non-domesticated birds. Now only qualified and trained employees of the City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Animal Care & Control, licensed veterinarians, licensed wildlife rehabilitators, wildlife capture and transportation permittees, and the Pennsylvania Game Commission can trap wild or non-domesticated birds, and they are only permitted to do so when necessary to capture an injured bird or a bird located inside a building. Assisting Councilor Kraus in drafting the language were attorneys Elissa Katz, Esquire, and Humane PA and HAP volunteer David Mongillo, Esquire, with consultation from Pittsburgh Police Officer Christine Luffey and HAP member and pigeon expert Cheryl Mosco.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/environmental-stewardship/safeguarding-our-rivers-from-nurdles/","Safeguarding our Rivers from Nurdles Overview An ethylene cracker plant is being built in Beaver County that will produce and ship billions of nurdles, tiny pellets used as a building block for plastic products. Problem As seen insimilar plantsacross the country where proper safeguards were not in place, nurdles often end up in our waterways. Animals often mistake the nurdles for food and ingest them, leading to suffering and death.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/environmental-stewardship/safeguarding-our-rivers-from-nurdles/","The Facts Neither PA nor Federal law prohibit nurdle discharges. It is only through education and relationship-building both within the community and with the producers (in this instance, Shell) that meaningful policies to prevent and mitigate nurdle discharges can be achieved. What is HAP doing about it? HAP is working with other plastics and environmentally minded groups, along with state and local elected officials, to create a dialogue with Shell regarding Best Management Practices, clear accountability, and a robust, public monitoring plan. How You Can Help Donationswill help support our efforts to protect the environment and wildlife. Come to our next meeting for updates on this campaign and our other projects.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/resources/","Resources Humane Action Pittsburgh is here to help! We have developed these resource lists for various campaigns and projects and want them to be available to the public. Please feel free to share our resource guides and email us with any suggestions atinfo@humaneactionpittsburgh.org. Love Your Wild Neighbor Raccoons, groundhogs, and skunks are part of wild, wonderful Pennsylvania. HAP is working on a campaign to educate residents of Allegheny County and beyond on humane harassment techniques that serve as an alternative to trapping. Pet Owner Resources The Allegheny County District Attorneys’ Office and Pittsburgh Police requested compact lists of veterinary clinics and shelters for emergent situations, as well as low cost spay/neuter programs and food resources for struggling pet owners. While we created these lists to help law enforcement officers and district attorneys give animals brought in through the legal system the best possible care and provide those owners with the contacts they need to properly care for their pets in hard times, we also hope they can be of service to anyone in need. Crisis Resources Harmony Dog Rescue collaborated with HAP on this comprehensive guide dedicated to offering vital emergency animal resources tailored for individuals facing crisis situations such as domestic violence and homelessness. This document serves as a crucial reference, providing readers with essential information and support to ensure the well-being of their animal companions during challenging times. Advice for Adopting a Shelter Pet HAP Assistant Blogger, Hannah Lewis, collaborated with Mekaila Oaks from Redfin to share some advice to prepare your home for a shelter pet. If you or someone you are know are considering adding a shelter pet to your family, please check out some of our tips. Plant-Based Diet Resources HAP fully supports a plant-based, vegan diet, but we understand the transition may be difficult.","text",3
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/resources/","However, going plant-based today is easier than it has ever been before. We have gathered a list of resources, including movies, books, website, and podcasts, to help guide you on your way.","text",4
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/resources/","Tips for Eliminating Single-Use Plastic Single-use plastic is everywhere. Once we are done using these items, they end up in our landfills and waterways where they endanger animals and contaminate the environment for hundreds of years. At HAP, we are committed to reducing and eliminating single-use plastic whenever possible. For resources to help, please check outNoPlasticPlease.net. Humane Education Programs HAP also offers free speakers to discuss animal protection and compassionate living for high school and college classes, assemblies and events. In addition, HAP provides free speakers to discuss theEvery Living Thingcampaign to houses of faith. If you are interested, please fill out our form.","text",5

The global decline in bee populations is a serious issue, primarily due to pesticide use and habitat loss. With over 20,000 bee species on Earth officially listed as endangered, the threat of extinction is imminent. The Importance of Pollinators Bees and all pollinators play a crucial role in pollination, enabling plants to reproduce. The decline in their populations poses a direct threat to various flowers, plants, and even our food sources. To prevent ecological disaster, we must take action to save these vital pollinators. Introducing HAP Hive HAP Hive, an initiative by Humane Action Pittsburgh, aims to address the pollinator population crisis. Our focus is on habitat regeneration, citizen education, and creating pollinator-friendly environments.

HAP is working on a campaign to educate residents of Allegheny County and beyond on humane harassment techniques that serve as an alternative to trapping. Need Wildlife HelpNow? Ineffective Methods The City of Pittsburgh has one of the most inhumane and ineffective trapping programs for a city of our size in the country. Outside the city, most wildlife management companies are not any better. Not only does trapping not solve the problem residents are facing with wildlife, but by state law, rabies-vector species (raccoons, groundhogs, skunks) MUST be killed. Each year, hundreds of animals are euthanized by Pittsburgh’s Animal Care and Control—at taxpayer expense. Trapping these animals doesn’t solve the problem and should only be used for emergencies, such as an animal in your living space. Not only wouldhumane solutionshelp animals and create a lasting solution, but also save thousands of taxpayer dollars and the valuable time of our Animal Care and Control officers. The vast majority of wildlife “conflicts” are created by humans, and most wildlife pose no risk of rabies. Want to know more about humane wildlife solutions? Sign up for our newsletter!","text",3

The animals commonly targeted are those often considered predators and pests, such as coyotes, raccoons, foxes.","text",3
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/state-and-federal-initiatives/end-wildlife-killing-contests/","https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org//wp-content/uploads/2021/06/red-fox-outdoors.jpg","image",4
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/state-and-federal-initiatives/end-wildlife-killing-contests/","Problem These contests are incredibly inhumane, and it has been reported that Pennsylvania has more Wildlife Killing Contests than anywhere else in the country. The Facts WKCs are brutal and unsportsmanlike, even in the eyes of most hunters. Targeted animals are killed en masse without regard to ethical hunting procedures. The bodies of the animals are typically dumped like garbage once the prizes are awarded. In part because participants often use electronic calling devices and hunting dogs, WKCs have no notion of fair chase, the fundamental hunting ethic that dictates that the hunter should not gain an unfair advantage over the hunted. Participants exploit misunderstanding and fear around species like coyotes and claim that by killing them in contests, they are helping to protect livestock, pets, and increase numbers of game species like deer and turkeys. However, there is no scientific proof about these claims, and many studies even show that these contests do more harm than good. What is HAP doing about it? In 2020, HAP procured Writs of Council and Proclamations condemning Wildlife Killing Contests from the City of Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Bellevue, Sharpsburg, and Monessen. We met with dozens of legislators and the Pennsylvania Game Commission throughout 2020 to discuss the issue. In May 2020, in partnership with Project Coyote and Animal Wellness Action, HAP hosted a screening of the documentary “The Killing Games” to educate the general public about Wildlife Killing Contests. How You Can Help Contact the PA Game Commissionto express your disgust with these cruel and unsporting contests.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/victories/mural","Born just twelve miles from downtown Pittsburgh, Jeremy Michael Raymer’s early connection to art grew in childhood watching Bob Ross painting happy little trees and continued into young adulthood attending several studio courses as an undergrad. However, he never gave much thought to a career path as an artist, so he attended the University of Pittsburgh and graduated with a degree in Bioengineering in 2004. Returning again in 2010 for a second degree in Electrical Engineering, Jeremy spent the decade as a professional in various science and engineering disciplines. It was during this time he was living in San Francisco where he was inspired to take up painting in his spare time. During the first 7 years of exploration, Jeremy used oils and brushes to create small-scale works. After visiting Wynwood Walls near Miami in 2013, he experienced a display of large scale murals like he had never seen before. Their diverse styles, sheer number and eclectic combination of genres inspired him to try it. He purchased his first can of spray paint as soon as he returned home. It wasn’t long before he realized this medium allowed him to considerably increase the speed and surface area of his projects as well as drastically expand his color palette. Considering his murals as very large drawings, his approach evokes a sense of intimacy with the viewer— each piece unique and rich with emotion particularly within portraits and eyes. In 2016 Jeremy walked away from financial security as a Senior Test Engineer and committed his efforts to work as a professional artist full time. Now, every waking moment is dedicated to propel his craft forward. Constantly working to develop his abilities and become one of the most notable muralists in Pittsburgh, each of Jeremy’s pieces outshines the last. He is influenced by his experience as a scientist, along with current events, pop culture, and antique photography.","text",7

As ofOctober 14th, 2023, all retail establishments (grocery stores, restaurants, convenience stores, big box stores, etc.) operating within the City of Pittsburgh are prohibited from providing a single-use plastic bag or a non-recycled paper bag to a customer at checkout or through delivery.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/regional-initiatives/return-aza-standards-at-the-pittsburgh-zoo/","Return AZA Standards at the Pittsburgh Zoo Pittsburgh Zoo Elephant Controversy: An Overview of AZA Accreditation Forfeiture In 2015, the Pittsburgh Zoo relinquished its AZA accreditation due to concerns surrounding its elephant handling policy, constituting a significant breach of their lease agreement with the City of Pittsburgh. Despite multiple extensions, the Zoo has yet to achieve compliance with the required standards. Challenges such as separating bonded elephant pairs, opposition to progressive and humane Pittsburgh ordinances, and a poignant critique from a veterinarian describing the Zoo as a “third world jail for elephants” resulted in the Pittsburgh Zoo being named the “2019 Worst Zoo in North America for Elephants” by In Defense of Animals.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/regional-initiatives/return-aza-standards-at-the-pittsburgh-zoo/","Accreditation Matters: AZA vs. ZAA – Understanding the Distinction One critical issue in the Pittsburgh Zoo controversy is the shift from AZA to ZAA accreditation. The concern arises as the letters “ZAA” deceptively resemble the esteemed AZA, but, in reality, represent a different entity. The ZAA is a trade organization that advocates for the rights of private citizens and exhibitors to own exotic animals. This transition prompts questions about the standards and regulations governing animal welfare and public safety at the Pittsburgh Zoo. Lease Agreement Explained:The City of Pittsburgh owns the land the Zoo uses. The Zoo receives many perks, such as $1/year in rent, financial support from the City to maintain the parking lot, free event hosting items from the City, taxpayer-subsidized water and sewage, and more. In exchange, the Zoo has several responsibilities they must agree to – including maintaining AZA accreditation. The fact that they voluntarily relinquished this accreditation means they have been in violation of the lease since 2015. To our knowledge, the City has not enforced any consequences against the Zoo. The most recent lease expired in December 2022 and was granted an extension by Pittsburgh City Council that has now expired. Humane Action Pittsburgh is working hard to ensure the new lease requires AZA accreditation and includes actionable, meaningful damages for a breach. Uncertain Future:Protecting Animal Welfare Amidst Accreditation Shifts —In the Pittsburgh Zoo controversy, an uncertain future looms. If concerns about accreditation are dismissed, or worse, the AZA requirement is omitted from the new lease terms, critical animal protections, including routine veterinary care requirements, may be jeopardized. The lack of proper accreditation, compounded by the zoo’s history of USDA violations, makes a compelling case for restoring AZA standards. Further, from July 2023 to February 2024, at least five animals died at the Pittsburgh Zoo.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/regional-initiatives/return-aza-standards-at-the-pittsburgh-zoo/","While we by no means have any way to know whether negligence was at play or a rather unfortunate coincidence, this underscores the importance of AZA accreditation, in which unbiased experts can monitor the care of the animals.","text",6
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/regional-initiatives/return-aza-standards-at-the-pittsburgh-zoo/","Unveiling the Reality: HAP’s Stance on Pittsburgh Zoo Accreditation HAP’s Position:Humane Action Pittsburgh (HAP) clarifies its mission—it does not seek the shutdown of the Pittsburgh Zoo. Instead, HAP advocates for the restoration of AZA accreditation. The goal is to ensure optimal care for the animals, emphasizing the need for substantial and enforceable damages in the new lease with the city. The current lease’s only recourse for noncompliance is eviction, underscoring the importance of proactive measures.

The current lease’s only recourse for noncompliance is eviction, underscoring the importance of proactive measures. ZAA Concerns: Roadside Zoo Association:HAP highlights concerns about the ZAA catering to roadside zoos, akin to those depicted in “Tiger King.” Inadequate Standards:ZAA’s standards are critiqued for insufficiently safeguarding animal welfare and public safety. Lobbying Against Legislation:Notably, the ZAA is accused of lobbying against animal protection laws and seeking exemptions for its members. Conflict of Interest: Former Leadership Dilemma:It is worth mentioning that Barbara Baker, the Pittsburgh Zoo’s former President and CEO, held the position of ZAA Board Chair, creating a clear conflict of interest. Dr. Baker oversaw the accreditation of her own organization under the ZAA. HAP’s Advocacy in Action: Restoring AZA Accreditation at the Pittsburgh Zoo HAP’s Strategic Initiatives:Humane Action Pittsburgh (HAP) actively engages in advocating for the restoration of AZA accreditation at the Pittsburgh Zoo.","text",7
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/regional-initiatives/return-aza-standards-at-the-pittsburgh-zoo/","Key initiatives include ongoing meetings with Public Safety officials, Pittsburgh City Council, and the Mayor. HAP emphasizes the importance of reinstating AZA accreditation to ensure the highest standards of animal care. Letters have been dispatched to the Pittsburgh Zoo Board, donors, and sponsors, outlining the breach of lease, the significance of proper accreditation, and proposing resolutions.","text",8
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/regional-initiatives/return-aza-standards-at-the-pittsburgh-zoo/","Lease Recommendations:With the current zoo lease expiring on December 31, 2022, HAP has meticulously crafted detailed recommendations for the new lease. These recommendations aim to introduce definitive and actionable damages, providing a framework for addressing noncompliance effectively. Supporting the Zoo’s Reapplication: In March 2021, the Pittsburgh Zoo announced its intention to reapply for AZA accreditation. HAP has issued a Public Statement in support of this proactive step, underlining the positive impact that reinstating AZA accreditation can have on animal welfare standards. How You Can Contribute: Express Your Support:Email letters backing AZA accreditation restoration and demanding lease compliance to key stakeholders, including Pittsburgh Zoo President Dr.Jeremy Goodman, Board Chair Donna Hudson, Mayor Ed Gainey, Councilwoman Deb Gross, and Zoo sponsors. Stay Informed:Follow and share HAP’s progress on this campaign, participate in community meetings, and contribute to the ongoing dialogue. Donate to Support:Contribute to HAP’s campaigns, including efforts to uphold animal welfare standards at the Pittsburgh Zoo.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-horrors-of-puppy-mills/","The Horrors of Puppy Mills byAimee Douglass|Oct 8, 2020 Dogs are man’s best friend, and for great reason. They provide companionship, loyalty, protection, and unconditional love all their lives. However, man has faltered when it comes to fostering that relationship built on trust, instead commodifying them as a means to earn a living. I’m writing, of course, about the puppy mill industry.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-horrors-of-puppy-mills/","“Any commercial dog breeding facility can be considered a puppy mill. A puppy mill’s sole purpose is to produce puppies as inexpensively as possible for maximum retail profit, often disregarding living standards and basic medical care” – United Against Puppy Mills (UAPM), a non-profit advocacy group Pennsylvania is ranked 3rd in the country when it comes to the number of puppy mills operating within the Commonwealth. This is up from the previous ranking of 4th. Every year, the Humane Society releases its “Horrible Hundred” list of the worst puppy mills in the United States.This year’s report, released in May, listed 6 horrible puppy mills in Pennsylvania and detailed the violations at each. It’s important to note that while one may not go directly to a puppy mill, the possibility of a dog in a pet store coming from a puppy mill is high.​Outside of the treatment of the dogs within the mills, where females are bred to exhaustion and then discarded or destroyed when no longer useful, the selling of dogs from these mills in pet stores is especially heartbreaking, as numerous individuals, unaware of the dog’s origin, end up purchasing puppies that are in many cases afflicted with conditions that can lead to numerous medical bills, and in extreme cases, even death. That is why in December 2015, members of HAP worked with City Council to successfully pass thePuppy Mill Ban Ordinance, which made it illegal to sell commercially bred dogs, as well as cats and rabbits, within city limits at retail establishments. Our legislative partners are now working to pass a bill that would make it illegal within all of Pennsylvania. HAP will provide action items for you to take to support this legislation.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-horrors-of-puppy-mills/","What Can You Do? Puppy mills rely on supply and demand to continue to operate. If the demand is removed, they will have to adjust their supply. Seek out reputable breeders or shelters instead of puppy mills to find your new friend. Determining if you are communicating with a puppy mill or if a dog in a pet store came from a puppy mill requires a bit of legwork.  Just because a website says they do not get their dogs from puppy mills, that is not always the truth. Here are some red flags that indicate a puppy mill in action, as provided byRover.com: No responsible breeder would sell a puppy through a pet store or directly online without careful vetting. In fact, most reputable breeders don’t need to advertise on the Internet to place their dogs.​As an alternative, there are many fun-loving, special dogs in rescues across Pittsburgh, such asHumane Animal Rescue,Animal Friends, among others – check out their websites to find a new friend!Petfinderis also a great resource if you are looking for a particular size, age, or type of dog as it pulls listings from rescues across the U.S. Aimee Douglassis the Director of Compassionate Living.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-power-of-haps-education-programs/","The Power of HAP’s Education Programs byAbhi Nadendla|Jun 27, 2023 John F. Kennedy once said, “The future promise of any nation can be directly measured by the present prospects of its youth”. Thus, I think it’s safe to say that our future is bright in terms of building a more sustainable future thanks to the passionate students paving the way in HAP’s youth programs. The impact students can have on promoting a humane world can be seen in the success of the HAP Dice Club. Currently in its third year and located at Taylor Allderdice High School, this club focuses on promoting a lifestyle that results in a humane world for all animals and recognizes the important role they have in ending the climate crisis. HAP Dice was born when student Beatrice Kuhn decided to take initiative after learning about the government’s unjust treatment of horses. Determined to create change, she decided to meet with Dr. Brian Bonsteel (HAP’s president and founder) to start a club to spread awareness about animal protection. During an average meeting, the club meets to talk about the tools of social change and effective communication with legislators about specific issues that are meaningful to animals, such as the effect of plastic pollution on marine life. Furthermore, HAP Dice adopted a code of ethics to live by, such as not using plastic containers, so that members can be the change they wish to see in the world. By bringing someone along with them in making these personal choices as opposed to simply telling someone else how to live more humanely, the club has effectively diffused its code of ethics throughout its community.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-power-of-haps-education-programs/","Filmmaking students at La Roche University, led by Dr. Crystal Fortwangler, decided to craft a similar message through a different medium by producing short videos that educated viewers about animal protection. By researching dogs in puppy mills, growing sustainable food, and practicing advocacy, the students created public service videos that were shown at the campus film festival. Essentially, this effort by the students stood out; not only were they able to highlight different animal protection campaigns and make them attractive to the college-age demographic, but they were also able to affect the public in a way that solely words can’t. However, the power of HAP youth isn’t limited to HAP Dice and the La Roche videos, theYouth Steering Committee(YSC), launching in September 2023 will unite high school students passionate about animal welfare and the environment. The YSC will help students build relationships, craft compelling messages, lead with effective communication, and understand specific issues threatening animals, allowing them to grow into seasoned advocates. These students will also earn a $1,000 stipend for their efforts in executing campaigns that advocate for a more humane lifestyle. Ultimately, the YSC is an opportunity for HAP to continuously concentrate on a small group of students and walk them through advocacy, as opposed to making annual visits to different high schools in the Pittsburgh area and educating the students there about animal welfare. HAP’sJunior Animal Advocate Summer Sessionslocated at Hope Haven Farm Sanctuary is another program that educates students about the connection between farm animal protection, environmental health, and our own wellbeing. The Hope Haven sessions are run by Dr. Karen Philips, a veterinarian who works at Animal Friends. Housing 97 rescued farm animals, this sanctuary helps the public view animals as sentient beings rather than something to exploit.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-power-of-haps-education-programs/","Ultimately, giving students the necessary tools and guidance to become advocates of social change is especially important and HAP’s educational programs strive to do just that. These programs inspire students to use their energy, passion, and determination to mobilize communities and drive positive change. With these individuals ready to promote animal and environmental welfare, we are certainly well on our way to achieving a more humane future.","text",6

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/its-beginning-to-look-a-lot-like-veganuary/","Now that the hustle and bustle of the holidays has settled, it’s time to turn our attention to Veganuary, an annual challenge run by a non-profit organization in the United Kingdom during the month of January. The challenge began in 2014 and aims to support people in their pledge to go vegan. What started as a monthly challenge, however, has developed into a substantial platform for the promotion of veganism. The vision of those dedicated to the mission of Veganuary is a world without animal farming and slaughterhouses; a world where producing food does not endanger animals, pollute rivers and oceans, adversely affect climate change, and destroy forests. It’s a lofty vision, but every victory, large and small, is one step closer to achieving their wonderful goal. Last year’s campaign saw monumental success. More than 620,000 people from over 220 different countries and territories were supported in their pledge to go vegan. There were also more than 1,540 new vegan products and menus launched during the challenge. Veganuary was able to achieve such success through national and international campaigns and by working with businesses to drive up vegan food choices in restaurants and supermarkets. Support on a more personal level can be obtained on the official website, Veganuary.com. All resources on the website are free and include a blog, recipes, tips to get started, nutrition facts, and a list of restaurants that include vegan choices including Hard Rock Cafe, Dominos and Burger King. A vision of this magnitude requires a tremendous amount of support. Veganuary ambassadors, such as actor Joaquin Phoenix and television personality and influencer Lucy Watson, are using their platform and standing up to promote veganism.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/its-beginning-to-look-a-lot-like-veganuary/","Veganuary also partners with like-minded groups such as Animals Australia, The Vegan Society, and Greenpeace which affirms their mission to use non-violent creative action to pave the way towards a greener, more peaceful world, and to confront the systems that threaten our environment. Sponsors include AVEDA, a 100% vegan hair and skin care line, eatplanted, a team that created and marketed a plant-based meat alternative, and many more.","text",6

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/its-beginning-to-look-a-lot-like-veganuary/","Let’s take a look at what veganism entails and how it would truly impact our world. Veganism is consuming only foods composed of plants and avoiding all animal products including meat, dairy, eggs, and honey. A vegan diet would typically include foods such as whole grains, vegetables, fruit, beans, seeds, and nuts. A vegan lifestyle doesn’t end with diet, however, and includes not wearing fur, leather, wool, down as well as refraining from using any products tested on animals. So why do all of this? The obvious answer is animal cruelty. The quality of life for animals on factory farms is appalling. They are mutilated, confined to extremely small areas, drugged, and generally mistreated. But it is so much more than that. The effects of animal farming are far reaching and not only negatively impact animals but also our planet and our health. Animal waste from animal agriculture is the leading cause of pollution in groundwater and rivers. Also, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, animal agriculture causes environmental problems such as contamination of aquatic ecosystems, soil and drinking water from manure, pesticides and fertilizers; acid rain from ammonia emissions; and greenhouse gas production. And if that doesn’t spur you to start your vegan journey, then consider the fact that animal fats and proteins are linked to heart disease, colon and lung cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes, kidney disease, hypertension, and obesity. And not surprisingly, according to the American Dietetic Association, a vegan diet reduces the risk of all these illnesses. For more information and support regarding a plant-based diet, please refer to HAP’s Get Healthy Pittsburgh! program and documentary. This amazing program coaches participants daily on how to prepare balanced meals, short cut food prep, incorporate more activity in less time and so much more. There are many ways to support Veganuary during the month of January and all year long.","text",8

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wildlife-corridors-in-pennsylvania/","Although many of us use outdoor recreation spaces extensively, this may be a year when our state, county, and city parks have been more valuable to us than ever before. We may think of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania as places with expansive amounts of green space available almost anywhere in the state that you live, and that’s true. We’re lucky to have access to plants and animals all across the state. However, there are factors we may not be aware of that can limit the resilience of these green spaces, and particularly the wildlife with whom we share them. Humane Action Pittsburgh has been hard at work in 2020 working with the Endangered Species Coalition to get cosponsors on a house resolution to fund a study relating towildlife corridorsin Pennsylvania. Wildlife corridors are a tool that can help protect wildlife and the resilience of Pennsylvania’s various green spaces. In fact, HAP was able to speak with all of the Western Pennsylvania cosponsors of the resolution prior to their decision to sign on, which gave us the opportunity to explain the various ways in which corridors benefit all of us in the commonwealth.​As someone who was fairly new to the concept of wildlife corridors earlier this year, I attended a panel discussion put on by the Endangered Species Coalition back in November, which focused specifically on wildlife corridors as they pertain to Pennsylvania. What are Wildlife Corridors (and why do they matter)? First things first: as the Endangered Species Coalition puts it, a wildlife corridor is an: “area of habitat connecting wildlife populations separated by fragmentation,” which is beneficial because “habitat loss and fragmentation are the biggest drivers of species decline and extinction worldwide. Fragmentation reduces the ability of wildlife to migrate, find mates, disperse (establish new territories), and may limit their access to food and water.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wildlife-corridors-in-pennsylvania/","Fragmentation also limits wildlife’s ability to adapt to climate change.” ​So in what ways do wildlife corridors help human Pennsylvanians? I was surprised and intrigued to learn that there is not a single or simple answer to this question. In fact, speakers highlighted educational, health, and economic benefits in addition to the benefits to wildlife themselves. Since the panel included participants from a range of regions across the commonwealth and from a variety of expertise, I was able to delineate some clear benefits.","text",6
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wildlife-corridors-in-pennsylvania/","Fragmentation vs. Connection: Resilience of Green Spaces The revelation I found most striking, from Dan Ardia, biology professor at Franklin and Marshall, brought to my attention that even rural regions of Pennsylvania that I associate with green spaces are in danger. Green spaces abound in Pennsylvania, but their fragmentation by private lands, highways, and development keep them from being resilient. If deer in one patch of woods can’t breed with or use the resources from a nearby patch of woods, they can become less genetically diverse, more susceptible to illness, and generally less strong.​As panelist Katie Hess of the South Mountain Partnership pointed out, Pennsylvania has already invested a great deal of money in protecting green spaces, but unless corridors allow them to thrive, those past investments may be at risk. Green spaces that have smaller populations of animals and fewer animal species struggle to adapt to change, so connecting existing green spaces with corridors ensures these green spaces will continue to thrive in the future.","text",7

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wildlife-corridors-in-pennsylvania/","Green Spaces and Education Pennsylvania House Representative Mary Jo Staley, who sponsored the house resolution to research corridors, started the discussion with an explanation of green spaces’ importance to her life. As a child, Representative Staley participated in Girl Scouts, where she learned a great deal and developed a love of Pennsylvania’s natural beauty. Preserving these green spaces will allow future generations of scouts and other young people to learn more about the environment in their own back yards, which support an array of reptiles, insects, migratory birds, grasses, trees, and even well-loved mammals like deer.","text",9

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wildlife-corridors-in-pennsylvania/","Green Spaces and Wellness From Western Pennsylvania, Dr. Rebecca (Becky) Thomas of Slippery Rock University’s Parks and Conservation department described the role green spaces have played in Pennsylvanians’ lives in 2020 in particular. Preserving clean, healthy, inviting spaces means Pennsylvanians will have access to exercise and recreational activities, but Thomas also pointed out the extent to which nature can help improve our mental health, too. Furthermore, Dr. Mary Ann Bruns, of Penn State’s Soil and Microbiology department held up the school’s work with a “living filter” to demonstrate the ways in which protected green spaces may also function as a tool to protect wastewater quality. And, of course, many of us are all aware of thebenefits of treeson air quality–a particularly important point to me, sincePittsburgh’s air qualitydefinitely can use whatever help it can get. Economic Benefits Almost every speaker talked about the tourism dollars made in Pennsylvania from our green spaces. Many people might think of hunting and fishing as Pennsylvania’s main attractions, but of course there’s much more! Any Google Search will remind you of the numerous and magnificent bird migrations that stop off in Pennsylvania, not to mention the returning Eagle populations across the state (including inour own backyard). TheAppalachian Trailpasses through Pennsylvania. The Youghigheny’s whitewater rafting is highly sought-after, and Fall foliage from Lancaster in the south-east to theKinzua Bridge State Parkin the North-West attract sightseers and photographers each year.","text",11

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wildlife-corridors-in-pennsylvania/","Tourism dollars are a boon to a lot of rural communities in Pennsylvania, but green spaces provide other benefits, too, from keeping pollinator populations healthy to benefit agriculture to helping to absorb and purify waste water before it enters the water table (or washes a house’s foundation or street down a hillside). Ways to Help In addition to encouraging your legislator tosupport the house resolutionto research corridors, there are plenty of ways that readers can support wildlife movement between spaces. My favorite part of the November panel discussion focused on turning your backyard into a corridor. You might only have a postage-stamp front-and-back-yard in the city, like me, or perhaps you have more space in a suburb or rural area. Simple things we can do include keeping invasive species out of your yard, not going for a meticulously-manicured lawn, creating a pollinator garden, and especially supporting native trees for migratory birds to rest or nest in, especially those that will support insects that are a part of migratory birds’ diets.","text",13

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wildlife-corridors-in-pennsylvania/","One word of caution: in my neighborhood, many of my neighbors like to feed the deer, but think twice before doing that. You don’t want to lure deer near busy roads where they can create a hazard to drivers. Your city yard is a great corridor for pollinators and birds, but not necessarily so much for larger animals like deer. Those in rural communities can support deer populations, though, by minimizing the amount of fencing you use to separate your land from adjoining woods or fields where deer might be moving.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-fda-modernization-act-2-0-passed-what-does-that-mean/","photo courtesy of PCRM.org In December 2022, Congress passed and President Biden signed into law the FDA Modernization Act 2.0. This was welcomed by animal activists the world over, as it addressed a long-followed rule that has meant the death and destruction of many animal species in the testing of drugs. After the marketing of a product called Elixir Sulfanomide led to the deaths of more than 100 people, Congress enacted the original Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) in 1938. It required that all drugs be tested on animals before being tested on humans. After 85 years, advancements in clinical testing and trials necessitated the complete removal of the mandate from the act, updating it for modern times. Animal testing is now removed from the Act altogether. So what does that mean? This revision to the Act means that clinical testing must be performed using what are referred to as New Approach Methodologies, aka New Alternative Methods, or NAMs. These modern capabilities eliminate the needless suffering of animals during testing that often does not result in the same outcomes as with humans. Specifically, the Act: In Section 3209 of the FDA Modernization Act 2.0 entitled “Animal Testing Alternatives,” the bill amends the regulatory guidance at the FDA that requires animal testing for drugs and biosimilars. The bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act (FFDCA) to: In addition to the  benefits of this update for animals, animal-free testing is also more accurate, cost-effective, faster, and more environmentally friendly3. For example, trials utilizing human skin cells grown via in-vitro methods have been shown to be more effective than traditional animal tests on rabbits, where results were shown to be incorrect 40 percent of the time. Testing using human skin cells also can provide results in as short a time period of minutes, whereby animal testing takes weeks or months.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-fda-modernization-act-2-0-passed-what-does-that-mean/","With the volume of new drug therapies being developed, this can obviously lead to products being available for human use much faster than with traditional animal-based testing methods. Finally, disposal of animals exposed to potential toxins as part of animal testing procedures represents an environmental concern, as those toxins could potentially make their way into the ground of water, destroying ecosystems and poisoning communities3.","text",6
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-fda-modernization-act-2-0-passed-what-does-that-mean/","The update of this Act represents a sea of change when it comes to how humans treat animals, as ethical concerns about the needless use and destruction of animals were a huge driver. Health organizations are applauding this move as a long-needed one that will help to improve human health overall2. Through the use of more accurate models instead of animals whose physiology differs from those of humans, consumers can have confidence in the drugs that they are taking, while reducing the biological waste that comes with the disposal of animals used for testing. As animal lovers committed to making the treatment of animals more humane, HAP applauds this bi-artisan accomplishment that demonstrates what people who are passionate about an issue can achieve in making policy change. 1https://cn-bio.com/us-fda-modernization-act-2-what-does-it-mean/ 2https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/center-for-contemporary-sciences-ccs-applauds-congress-for-passing-the-fda-modernization-act-that-will-save-millions-of-lives-301709763.html 3https://www.invitrointl.com/blog/the-many-benefits-of-using-alternatives-to-animal-testing/ Aimee Douglassis the Director of Compassionate Living.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/hb-1210-protecting-companion-animals-in-abuse-cases/","HB 1210: Protecting Companion Animals in Abuse Cases byAbhi Nadendla|Jun 27, 2024 In a landmark step towards enhancing the safety and welfare of both human and animal victims of domestic violence, House Bill 1210 (HB 1210) proposes a significant expansion of protection from abuse (PFA) orders. The bill aims to allow for companion animals to be included under the protective umbrella of these orders, recognizing the critical role pets play in the lives of abuse victims and the unique vulnerabilities they face in abusive environments.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/hb-1210-protecting-companion-animals-in-abuse-cases/","The Need For HB 1210 Domestic violence is a pervasive issue that affects millions of individuals across the United States. Victims of abuse often endure not only physical and emotional harm, but also the threat of violence against their beloved pets. Abusers frequently exploit this bond, using threats and actual harm to animals as a means of exerting control and instilling fear. According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV), 71% of women entering domestic violence shelters report that their abuser threatened, harmed, or killed their family pets. For many victims, the fear of leaving their pets behind in a dangerous situation is a significant barrier to escaping an abusive relationship. Traditional PFAs offer protection to individuals by legally prohibiting abusers from contacting or coming near them. However, without explicit legal protections for pets, abusers can continue to exert power and control by targeting these vulnerable family members. Thus, this bill provides a double-pronged support by ensuring the wellbeing of pets and removing a source of worry for their owners. Breaking Down the Bill HB 1210 seeks to address this critical gap by allowing judges to include companion animals in PFAs. Key provisions of the bill include: Impact on Victims and Pets As aforementioned, the inclusion of pets in PFAs is expected to have several positive outcomes such as enhanced safety for victims. By ensuring that pets are protected, survivors can leave abusive environments without the added stress and fear for their animals’ safety. Furthermore, this bill would also result in a reduction in abuse tactics as abusers would lose a significant tool of manipulation and control; by making it illegal to put their pets in harm’s way, the overall severity of the abuse would be lessened as victims no longer feel the same pressure to comply.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/hb-1210-protecting-companion-animals-in-abuse-cases/","Lastly, this bill could also work to empower those being abused as they would be more likely to seek help and report any domestic violence since they know it will ensure that their pets will be safe and protected.","text",6
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/hb-1210-protecting-companion-animals-in-abuse-cases/","Support and Advocacy HB 1210 has garnered strong support from domestic violence advocacy groups, law enforcement agencies, animal welfare organizations, and legal professionals. Advocates argue that the bill is a necessary evolution in the legal response to domestic violence, aligning with a growing recognition of the importance of pets in victims’ lives and holding the promise of offering much-needed relief and security to countless individuals and their beloved animals. “Pets are family members and play an essential role in offering comfort to individuals experiencing abuse,” said Pennsylvania State Representative Christina Sappey. “It is imperative that we take action to safeguard animals in conjunction with thewell-beingof those suffering from domestic violence.” HB1210 has already passed the House with bipartisan support. Now, it is imperative we work together to pass this bill through the Senate by the end of the year. However, Pennsylvania is currently one out of ten states that hasn’t supported its progression. To turn this around, we need you to contact your PA senator and encourage them to support this bill as it moves through the legislative process. Clickhereto find your PA state senator. Ultimately, the passage of HB 1210 would mark a significant step forward in the fight against domestic violence, ensuring that all members of a household, human and animal alike, are safeguarded from harm.

This initiative empowers individuals and organizations to ditch eight common plastic offenders: cutlery, take-out containers, bottles, cups, bags, stirrers, straws, and styrofoam. Discover readily available, eco-friendly alternatives to make a positive impact on the environment. We Must Take Action Now On our current trajectory, by the year 2050 the amount of plastic trash in the ocean will outweigh all the fish. Recycling Isn’t Working Only 9% of all plastic ever made has been recycled.Most ends up in our landfills and oceans. Single-use plastics, used for mere minutes, persist for hundreds or thousands of years, contributing to litter in communities and waterways. These plastics infiltrate our daily lives and pose a significant threat to the environment. For individuals, we provide education, motivation, and resources to help avoid the deluge of single-use plastic that is offered to each of us every single day. For organizations, including businesses, schools, or community groups, we provide education and form partnerships to support these entities in moving forward with reducing their single-use plastic waste. On legislation, we speak directly with policymakers to elevate the issue of unchecked single-use plastic waste and we work with our network of engaged citizens to support smart legislative actions. NO PLASTIC PLEASE EMPOWERS INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES TO ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY SINGLE-USE PLASTIC TO REDUCE THE SUFFERING OF ALL. No Plastic Please is a campaign of Humane Action Pittsburgh that works on three levels: INDIVIDUAL, ORGANIZATIONAL, & LEGISLATIVE Join the Movement Everywhere we go, stores and shops hand us single-use plastic items for everything from bags to spoons. It’s completely normal to use these items for 20 minutes or less before we throw them away.","text",3

Prepare for Success Create Your Own SUP-Free kit Good intentions to refuse single-use plastic won’t help you when you’re faced with an ice cream sundae you can’t eat with your fingers or leftovers you need to transport home. The best thing you can do to be successful in your pledge is to create your own “SUP-free” kit. The idea of this kit is to empower you to say no to single-use plastics in most situations by providing your own alternatives at easy reach. Expand Your Impact Where are you a stakeholder or decision-maker? Where are single-use plastics used at your office, your school, your church, or other group? Are there places where single-use plastics are the default choice but where different decisions might be made if the true cost of single-use plastics were part of the decision process?

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/creating-a-wildlife-friendly-backyard/","Photo courtesy of National Audobon Society Owning a house or renting a property with a bit of green space is good for the soul. It offers a relaxing place to unwind, a place to gather with friends, or for kids and pets to play. For years, part of the “American Dream” has been owning a bit of property and maintaining it to perfection. You see it every Saturday and Sunday – landscapers or homeowners out in their yards with their lawnmowers, hoses, and tools. However, what if the perfect lawns we are creating could have a greater purpose? One that would not only prevent the loss of wildlife species and their habitats, but also beautify the neighborhood? Instead of worrying about weeds, and spraying lawns with harsh chemicals, the focus could be on making a yard that is welcoming and friendly to organisms and animals native to the area. That focus would in turn help sustain the balance within our ecosystem. Animals have the same needs as humans – food, water, shelter. Without them, they die, and without the animals that are native to our area, who have a role within the ecosystem, humans could go the same way as species die off due to manmade chemicals that are unnatural. Indeed, saving the habitats of animals will help save all of us.","text",5

Disclaimer: These steps may lead to an influx of other animals, such as raccoons, groundhogs, and skunks, which are the animals that generate the most calls to authorities to remove. There are other ways, however. HAP’sLove Your Wild Neighborcampaign offers tips and tricks to prevent these “unwanted visitors” from sticking around WITHOUT resorting to having the animals trapped and killed.

At just 21 years old, Mindi founded Bailing Out Benji after unknowingly buying a puppy mill puppy from a pet store. She began ongoing protests at pet stores in Iowa, which inspired advocates from all over the country to do the same. In just a few short years, after being featured in a documentary, several books and a podcast with SONY, Mindi’s Iowa-based organization has expanded to include volunteer teams across the country. This nimble, innovative organization is entirely dedicated to ending the inhumane breeding practices of dogs and cats in commercial facilities. They work to research and reveal the links between puppy mills across the country and the pet stores and websites where the puppies are sold. Their research has been crucial in passing many local and state bills across the country which regulate the sales of puppies, kittens and rabbits in stores. While most national organizations are headquartered on the coasts or in large cities, Bailing Out Benji’s Iowa roots allow them to serve as a much needed and powerful voice for animals across the Midwest, which is a stronghold for animal agriculture and dog breeding. Pictured is Mindi with her dog Eleanor, who was rescued from the worst USDA licensed puppy mill in history.","text",25

It is the most rewarding work to see people climb in the driver’s seat with their health and take back what they thought was lost.” All of us here at HAP have been lucky to experience Laurie’s passion and enthusiasm for whole food, plant-based living.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/pc-page2/","While something like a banana peel will biodegrade and return to the earth, plastic waste, known as microplastics, breaks into smaller and smaller pieces. These microscopic fragments of plastics have been found globally in our food systems and even our own bodies.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/pc-page2/","Local Waterways A comprehensive study conducted by PennEnvironment sheds light on the pervasive presence of microplastics in Pennsylvania’s waterways. The research uncovered alarming findings at every site tested, including iconic locations in our own backyard. The Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio rivers, alongside smaller bodies such as Chartiers, Turtle, and Sewickley creeks, and Nine Mile Run in Allegheny County, all exhibited the presence of microplastics. Shockingly, plastic contamination was also identified in the Youghiogheny River in Fayette County and the Connoquenessing Creek in Beaver County. This revelation emphasizes the urgent need for collective action to address the widespread issue of plastic pollution in Pennsylvania’s waterways. Health Problems Beyond the environmental concerns surrounding plastic, the production and disposal processes introduce a slew of health risks associated with harmful additives. These include notorious substances like bisphenol-A (BPA), metals such as cadmium or lead, flame retardants, perfluorinated substances (PFAS), phthalates, and various other chemicals. Many of these additives are recognized endocrine-disrupting compounds, capable of altering hormonal balance. The implications are profound, with documented links to a spectrum of health impacts. From cancers and heart problems to obesity, diabetes, birth defects, and repercussions on the reproductive, immune, and nervous systems, the toll is extensive. Understanding the health risks associated with plastic additives is crucial. Stay informed about these findings and explore ways to reduce exposure. By fostering awareness, we contribute to healthier lifestyles and a safer environment. Join us in our commitment to spreading knowledge and creating a future free from the adverse effects of plastic-related chemicals.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-invisible-recyclers/","The Invisible Recyclers byAbhi Nadendla|Dec 10, 2022 The Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The Pacific trash vortex. A danger to marine life everywhere. Regardless of what you choose to call it, there is no denying the level of concern that the sight of 3.6 trillion pieces of plastic floating around in the ocean brings.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-invisible-recyclers/","Triple the size of France, this debris harms wildlife, disturbs marine food webs, and pollutes the ocean water. Since it mostly consists of non-biodegradable microplastics, this patch is unlikely to break down by itself in the foreseeable future. However, a recent scientific find brings hope: the discovery of plastic-digesting bacteria. While collecting plastic bottles outside a research facility in Japan, scientists observed a species of bacteria “eating” its way through the plastic. Most bacteria usually absorb deadorganicmatter but, it turns out,Ideonella sakaiensisdeveloped a taste for polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PET is widely used in daily life; in fact, virtually all single-serving and 2-liter bottles of soft drinks and water sold in the U.S. are made from PET. Upon further analysis of the bacteria, scientists were able to determine the exact mechanism that allows Ideonella sakaiensis to digest PET. Essentially, the bacteria produce two digestive enzymes called PETase. When these enzymes come into contact with plastic, they break down the long molecular chains into shorter chains called monomers. These monomers are further metabolized by the bacteria and used to release energy for growth.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-invisible-recyclers/","As exciting as this discovery is, this bacteria, unfortunately, comes with a few shortcomings. Firstly, it can’t decompose PET fast enough to mitigate the tens of millions of plastic waste that enters the environment every year, eventually accumulating in places like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. To solve this issue, genetic scientists are working on ways to increase the efficiency of this bacteria, hoping that one day it will be fast enough to help negate the effects of plastic pollution. One current research venture is to transfer PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis to a type of bacteria that produces enzymes at a faster rate, such as E. Coli, but they don’t expect this to succeed any time soon. Secondly, it’s important to remember that PET is only one of the six types of plastic that contributes to plastic pollution. Therefore, although being able to degrade it is a remarkable achievement, we are still unable to degrade other plastics using enzymes. As aforementioned, these advances are timely. During COVID-19, the use of single-use plastics has only increased, due to masks and takeaway boxes, and scientists have now calculated that Earth is on track to have as much plastic in the ocean as fish by weight in 2050. Therefore, it’s still important to actively work towards reducing plastic pollution. Here are some steps from our No Plastic Please campaign you can take to reduce your use of plastic: Moreover, while scientists work to improve the efficiency of plastic-digesting bacteria, we can work alongside them through our own efforts to improve the current state of plastic pollution. Through these combined efforts, it is likely that one day, the daunting  Great Pacific Garbage Patch will be a thing of the past. Abhi, this is really great!  My only suggestions are the action items I mentioned in the comments.  Please let me know if that feedback isn’t clear.

The film showcases elite athletes, special ops soldiers, visionary scientists, cultural icons, and everyday people – including Humane Action Pittsburgh! In September 2017, we were excited to have Wilks and his team attend ourVegan Night at PNC Park, the first vegan night at any major league sporting event in the country. Our event is featured in the bonus footage, and you may recognize some familiar faces, like HAP member Mario Costanzo! HAP Vice President, Natalie Ahwesh, is also named in the credits! The Pirates have continued the Vegan Night tradition since partnering with HAP, and several other teams in Major League Baseball have followed suit. HAP continues to work with local sports teams, including the Riverhounds, Steelers, and more, to raise vegan and environmental awareness. We are excited to support this groundbreaking film and have plans to host additional screenings in the future. Please stay tuned for more information!","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/victories/puppy-mill-ban/","Puppy Mill Ban In December 2015, Humane Action Pittsburgh successfully drafted and worked for the passage of two ordinances to protect mill-bred animals. The first is aretail sales banof dogs, cats, and rabbits not from a shelter or rescue in Pittsburgh, the first ordinance of its kind in the state of Pennsylvania. The Ordinance makes it illegal to sell commercially bred dogs, cats, and rabbits within city limits. Secondly, the companion ordinance requires any licensed breeders and kennels to disclose their kennel license and sales license in all advertisements. Since passing these laws in Pittsburgh, HAP has worked with the boroughs of Sharpsburg, Bellevue, Monessen, and Wilkinsburg to pass similar legislation. Our aim is to enact more similar laws all throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. If you are interested in working on legislation to combat puppy mills in your community, pleasereach out! Our work is made possible by donations from community members like you. Please consider supporting our work through amonthlyorone-timedonation.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-life-of-a-thanksgiving-turkey/","This year, more than 49,000,000 turkeys will be served as part of Americans’ Thanksgiving feasts. This will be the end of a short and miserable life for a bird that was once referred to by Benjamin Franklin as a “respectable bird” and a “bird of courage.” Turkeys, like chickens, are some of the most abused animals on the planet as part of the world’s food system. The average lifespan for a wild turkey is 10 years, yet domesticated turkeys, such as those on factory farms across the country, are killed at the age of 5 or 6 months. These birds do not live comfortable lives before they are slaughtered, either. Instead, they are taken from their mothers, kept in large sheds with very little light, and fed so much so quickly that many times their legs break under their own weight. Dead birds are discarded, but injured and diseased birds are still deemed safe for human consumption. This, after the birds spend their time on earth living on floors covered with feces, dead birds, and other waste. There is no benefit in keeping these areas clean on factory farms, because the turkeys are nothing more than a commodity. As noted by the Food Empowerment Project: “In industrial animal factories,turkeys know nothing of a natural life. The goal of industrial farming is to manipulate an animal’s nature to make them grow as fast as possible with the least expense. For turkeys, this flawed equation involves intense confinement, genetic engineering and a series of painful mutilations. Turkeys raised for “meat” bear little resemblance to their wild ancestors. The industry has no regard for the animals’ instincts or general well being-they are treated strictly as a commodity.”","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-life-of-a-thanksgiving-turkey/","The following are some facts about turkeys, courtesy ofOne Kind Planet: Turkeys are intelligent and affectionate animals, who enjoy having their feathers stroked and are able to recognize the faces and voices of people. They have multiple ways to communicate, utilizing different sounds to vocalize to other turkeys. This behavior is very similar to that of dogs, but we would never think of making a dog the centerpiece of a holiday gathering. Tradition is one thing, but clearly the cruelty inherent in the farming of these beautiful creatures is something that should be considered when planning a meal. This year, why not consider an alternative? There are numerous commercial products that mimic the taste and texture of turkey without the cruelty, from companies such as Tofurkey, Gardein, and Trader Joe’s, to name a few:","text",7

Kraus’s advocacy extended beyond traditional pets to encompass avian and reptilian protection, as evidenced by his pivotal roles in passing laws safeguarding birds and reptiles. Notably, he authored groundbreaking legislation banning the cruel production and serving of foie gras within Pittsburgh, a testament to his unwavering commitment to ethical practices.

In 1997, Christine began to sponsor fundraisers to help animals in the city of Pittsburgh through the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. She started Biscuits Bingo in 1998 and it has been an annual event that helps many organizations and groups to help animals in Pittsburgh.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/victories/pittsburgh-zoo-receives-aza-accreditation/","Pittsburgh Zoo Receives AZA Accreditation Following years of behind-the-scenes work by HAP leadership, on March 19, 2021, the Pittsburgh Zoo announced it was beginning the process of reinstating its AZA accreditation. In September 2024, the Zoo was approved by a unanimous vote to have its accreditation reinstated, a significant step forward in ensuring more humane treatment of animals in captivity. The Zoo ended its AZA accreditation in 2015 after disagreements with the AZA over elephant care standards, despite violating its lease with the city of Pittsburgh, which requires it to maintain AZA accreditation. Instead, the Zoo pursued accreditation from the ZAA, a weaker accreditation body that allowed unprotected contact between elephants and keepers—a dangerous practice HAP consistently opposed. Restoring the Zoo’s AZA accreditation marks a significant victory for animal welfare, raising the standard of care at the Pittsburgh Zoo. Humane Action Pittsburgh is committed to ensuring the Zoo operates at the highest standard possible for a zoo. While we recognize this as a positive step forward, we will continue to monitor their practices to safeguard the well-being of the animals.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/state-and-federal-initiatives/ban-live-pigeon-shoots/","Ban Live Pigeon Shoots Overview Live pigeon shoots are inhumane contests where live birds who have been captured, brought into Pennsylvania—often illegally from neighboring states—are shot at close range by shooters who earn points for every bird they shoot down within a certain range. Observers estimate that 70% of the birds are wounded but not killed outright. Banned under the cruelty laws in most states, Pennsylvania is one of the last states that legally and openly holds live pigeon shoots","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/state-and-federal-initiatives/ban-live-pigeon-shoots/","Problem An extremely cruel event, each live pigeon shoot results in unimaginable suffering. In preparation for the shoot, pigeons are kept in boxes and then launched one-by-one into the air by a spring loaded bottom. The birds are disoriented and confused as the shooter opens fire. Neighboring property owners around the shoots have watched wounded birds slowly bleed to death over hours — and even days. The Facts CHILD CORRUPTION After each round, birds within the shooting circle are collected – often by youth – and killed by slamming, snapping, or snipping the heads off or breaking their necks. GAMBLING ON AGONY Similar to dog fights, participants gamble on the outcome of these events. The “winners” receive prizes for killing. WANTON KILLING True sportsmen abhor these shoots — they understand there is nothing sporting about close-range shooting of mechanically-launched, dehydrated, and disoriented birds. OVERWHELMING SUPPORT OF BAN In addition to nearly every major and minor newspaper in the state, HAP supports a ban on live pigeon shoots along with The Humane Society of the United States, Pennsylvania Veterinary Medical Association, ASPCA, The Pennsylvania Bar Association, Pennsylvania Council of Churches, Pennsylvania Federation of Humane Societies, Humane Society of Berks County (where most shoots are held) as well as most shelters, humane societies, and animal organizations in the state. What is HAP doing about it? Working in conjunction with Humane PA and other organizations, HAP is advocating for the passage of HB1475, a bill to enact a statewide ban on live pigeon shoots. HAP worked with Pittsburgh City Council to pass a Wild Bird ordinance in 2020 that prohibits trapping, harming, and selling of pigeons. This rectifies language in a previous city ordinance that was unclear and unenforceable. Working in conjunction with Humane PA and other animal organizations, HAP strongly encourages the PA House and Senate to enact a statewide ban on live pigeon shoots.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/state-and-federal-initiatives/ban-live-pigeon-shoots/","We believe the majority of legislators will support the ban if brought to a vote. In fact, HAP has procured proclamations, writs of council, and letters written by elected officials in support of a statewide ban.","text",6
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/state-and-federal-initiatives/ban-live-pigeon-shoots/","We also urge the Pennsylvania Game Commission to ban live pigeon shoots statewide. Notably, the PA Game Commission has opined that a narrowly tailored ban on live pigeon shoots, as provided for in this legislation, will not affect any legal hunting activities in Pennsylvania. Whether passed as a legislative or regulatory ban, the PA Game Commission needs to acknowledge they have the authority to prevent extreme cruelty and that they answer to all Pennsylvanians, not just the pigeon shooting minority. How You Can Help Email or call your State Senator and State Representative asking for their support of bill HB1475 to ban live pigeon shoots. Find your legislatorshere. Email to the PA Game Commissioner, kindly reminding them they have the authority to ban live pigeon shoots and should do so immediately. Follow and share HAP for progress on this campaign and come to our community meetings.

Just this week, Pennsylvania’s first reported cases cropped up inLancaster County. So far, very few human infections have occurred, and those have primarily been among people in very close contact with infected birds–no human infections have occurred here in the U.S.,according to the CDC. However, millions of birds raised for their eggs and meathave been killedto prevent the spread of the disease, and it has infected and spread among waterfowl and other bird species worldwide, posing a potential danger to wild bird populations. Poultry Growing Conditions are Breeding Grounds for Diseases","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-next-pandemic-isnt-hitting-people-yet-but-its-destroying-our-birds/","“…Chicken eggs farm.“byArtem Beliaikin Some people may think, “well, disease happens. We’re dealing with a human pandemic, it only makes sense that pandemics would impact animals as well.” It’s worth remembering that even our own current Coronavirus pandemicmay have originatedfrom an animal virus spreading to humans as a result of wild animals and livestock being in inhumane, crowded conditions. Readers may remember that in June of 2020, blogger Aimee Douglass wrote aboutthe next pandemicand its link to cruel and inhumane treatment of livestock animals. It’s no secret that the number of poultry animals being killed right now directly relates to the way these animals are raised–in very crowded conditions, with limited diets, bred to grow too large too fast and produce too many eggs, and not bred to fight diseases. In these crowded and filthy conditions, diseases can and will spread very rapidly, meaning that just one infected hen can require the euthenasia of all of the chickens living near her–hence, millions of dead birds already in response to this outbreak.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-next-pandemic-isnt-hitting-people-yet-but-its-destroying-our-birds/","“…Chicken eggs farm.“byArtem Beliaikin This disease is decimating livestock and threatening wild birds, too, but what about its impact on humans? Many people may feel sad about the loss of bird life, both domestic and wild, but if the disease isn’t impacting people, will they feel any impact? Well, of course, there is always the danger that the diseasecouldspread to humans. As it infects more and more birds, it has more and more opportunities to mutate, just like COVID-19. But even now, many American families are feeling the impact on their wallets, too. What’sthatGot to Do with the Price of Eggs? Photo by stevepb on Pixabay A few months ago, I wrote abouteating a vegan diet on a budget. At that time, eggs were rising in price, but were still a fairly affordable protein source that was accessible to many. Egg alternatives like the tofu scramble I mentioned in the meal plan were more about affordable ways to avoid eggs for ethical reasons. But now, the price of eggs ison the riseas livestock are executed in mass numbers. Even as the cost of eggs goes up, commercially available egg alternatives likeJust Eggare getting significantly cheaper and more accessible. For example, my local Giant Eagle stocks Just Egg for $4.49 (as of April 18th), about the same price as a dozen organic eggs ($4.29-$6.99, depending on the brand, as of April 18th). As the Avian Flu continues to spread and egg prices continue to rise, these alternatives make more and more financial sense. Photo by青 晨onUnsplash","text",7
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-next-pandemic-isnt-hitting-people-yet-but-its-destroying-our-birds/","https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eggs-piled.jpg","image",8
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-next-pandemic-isnt-hitting-people-yet-but-its-destroying-our-birds/","And of course, the premature death of all of these chickens and turkeys also means that chicken and turkey will continue to rise in price. Because of the cramped conditions these chickens live in and the amount of meat that can be produced for a relatively small amount of resources, chicken has historically been another budget-friendly protein source for families worldwide, but particularly here in the U.S. The price of these birds’ flesh will likely also continue to go up. This is the time, friends, to give a vegan diet a chance. As I’ve mentioned before, I am not a vegan, but a vegetarian who tries to eat vegan as often as possible. I mention that as a reminder that helping animals isn’t about being perfect; it’s about doing as much as you can. Now, you’ve got a reminder about just how much these birds suffer and what the consequences of their suffering can be. Not only that, but you have a financial incentive, too, to cut poultry flesh and eggs out of your diet–or at least to cut back significantly on how much you eat. Can Anything Else Fill the Place of Eggs and Chicken on Our Plates? There are several ways to fill eggs’ and chickens’ places on your plate that will mean that you won’t even miss them. Tofu scrambles are super popular. My partner, who is an omnivore, had one atPittsburgh’s B52this weekend (we wanted to visit before the location closed permanently, but were thrilled to learn that some of their menu will remain available atAllegro Hearthin Squirrel Hill). She loved the dish and while she said it didn’t taste exactly like eggs, the taste and texture satisfied her breakfast craving just fine. While I don’t recommend ordering one from a vegan restaurant if your motivation is saving money, you can instead make one.","text",9
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-next-pandemic-isnt-hitting-people-yet-but-its-destroying-our-birds/","They’re very easy and versatile.Here’s onethat’s got a southwest flavor from my favorite vegan food blog, Minimalist Baker, but there are hundreds of variations that you can try.Remember, if you decide to introduce a spice like black salt (kala namak) to give your scramble that eggy smell and taste, check a local Indian grocer for a better price.","text",10
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-next-pandemic-isnt-hitting-people-yet-but-its-destroying-our-birds/","Alternatives for Cooking & Baking What about for all you bakers out there? Vegan baking got a recent boost from Vegan Great British Bake Off contestantFreya, but you don’t need her skill level to make tasty treats vegan. There are so many inexpensive ways to eliminate eggs from a baking recipe. They include aqua faba (which is the water from a can of chickpeas that you would otherwise throw away, so this is basically a free ingredient), flax seed (I get mine from Aldi), silken tofu, or even simple shelf-stable things like pumpkin puree or applesauce or things you might throw away like overripe bananas or brown (overripe) avocado (which can be frozen and used when you need them in a recipe). And if you want the convenience of an egg substitute, you can certainly purchase something like Just Egg–as I mentioned above, the price is pretty comparable to eggs nowadays. You can also make your own with a recipelike this one, which you can store in the refrigerator for up to a week for use each morning. When it comes to chicken substitutes, refer back to theVegan on a Budgetblog–you can go the meat substitute route, but I prefer to just replace meat in recipes with well-cooked tofu or legumes like chickpeas. ThisGeneral Tso’s Tofuis a personal favorite. There are a million ideas out there–don’t be afraid to look around! The world of vegetarian and vegan cooking has really taken off as people have learned about the sustainability of plant-focused diets, so you’re sure to find inspiration for all kinds of recipes you might never have tried if you relied on chicken for weeknight meals.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/life-cycle-of-a-single-use-compostable-product/","Life Cycle of a  Single-Use Compostable Product byHannah Lewis|Aug 24, 2021 Many of us share the goal of reducing the harm we do to the world around us and the animals with whom we share it. One of the ways we can pursue this goal is through the rejection of single-use plastic products in favor of compostable alternatives. While avoiding plastics–particularly single-use plastics–is a great start, there are a few factors that we must consider to ensure we make the swap as effectively as possible.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/life-cycle-of-a-single-use-compostable-product/","Single-Use Products When choosing a paper straw at a restaurant or a paper bag at the grocery store, you can easily ensure that the straw or bag returns to the earth in a sustainable way by composting it. Any backyard composting setup should be able to handle paper or cardboard, so these products are excellent replacements for their single-use plastic alternatives. But not all single-use compostables are so simple. Many of the single-use cups and lids made from compostable plastics can’t actually be easily broken down in a backyard system. These products require much higher temperatures to break down, and even the best backyard composting setup will be unlikely to reach those temperatures. Let’s walk through the life cycle of a single-use compostable product that isn’t able to be composted in a simple compost pile. We’ll compare it to a paper or cardboard single-use product, as well as to a single-use plastic. Once you’re armed with all the information possible about compostable products, you will be able to make more informed choices about what kinds of products you accept and how you dispose of them. Production of Single-Use Products: A Beginning-of-Life Comparison To begin, the creation of single-use products has its own environmental costs. To create a piece of plastic cutlery, for example,requiresthe extraction of fossil fuels which are a key component in the production of plastic. It also involves the creation ofnurdles–small plastic pellets which are created in large numbers and then formed into products like plastic cutlery. Here at Humane Action Pittsburgh, we areworking hardto protect regional waterways from nurdle pollution, because nurdles can cause major ecological problems if they arespilled into rivers or oceans, and the extraction of fossil fuels has its own environmental costs. The production of asingle-use compostablefork is different. The polymers used to create biodegradable plastic cutlery come from plants like corn or potatoes.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/life-cycle-of-a-single-use-compostable-product/","Wooden or bamboo single-use utensils also are available, and while the creation of these products does require trees or bamboo be harvested, these renewable resources can be replenished much more quickly than fossil fuels. Deforestation is a real issue for the environment and for the animals whose habitats are threatened, but because bamboo is a veryfast-growingplant, it can be harvested in very sustainable ways.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/life-cycle-of-a-single-use-compostable-product/","End of Life for Single-Use Products: A Comparison So far, the single-use biodegradable plastics may seem like the best answer, since they are derived from crops we already cultivate and don’t require deforestation or fossil fuel extraction. However, as we progress forward in the life cycle of these products, we encounter other factors such as the end-of-life carbon footprint and how these products can ultimately impact animal life. Many of us are already aware of the problems with plastic pollution. After you eat your salad with your plastic fork, it goes to the trash and then to the landfill. Of course, not all plastic makes it to the landfill due to litter, but even if it does, it still spends thousands of years sitting in the landfill. If it gets into bodies of water, it can cause an even bigger problem the magnitude of which is illustrated by thegreat pacific garbage patch. Sea birds and marine animals can eat small pieces of plastic by mistake or become trapped or injured by them. They can break apart making them very difficult to collect and redirect back to a landfill.Lisa’s blog postfor Respect for Fish Day earlier this month took an in-depth look at the harm plastic pollution is doing to marine life.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/life-cycle-of-a-single-use-compostable-product/","Biodegradable plastic sounds like a great alternative–and it can be. However, it can also pose some of the same problems as plastics if it isn’t sent to an industrial composting facility. Biodegradable plastic can still wind up in the water or ocean. If it does make it to the landfill, many consumers assume that the product will simply decompose naturally. However, in the absence of the right conditions, these productsmay not break downfor averylong time, so they can still pose a threat to animal life. But these products, if sent to the landfill, pose yet another problem. The decomposition process these products go through in a landfill releases methane gas, a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. Cutlery made from bamboo or wood can be composted with relative ease. If you have a simple backyard pile, you might want to break your chopstick or fork down into smaller pieces if you’re in a hurry for finished compost, but even thrown in as-is (with some food scraps to serve as a nitrogen source and some periodic turning to introduce oxygen), this carbon-rich material will eventually break down into nutritious soil that can be used in your yard, garden, or indoor planters. The Bottom Line While the efforts of business and consumers to avoid single-use plastics and adopt compostable products definitely deserve recognition, it’s important that consumers know how these products are made and what their end of life looks like. As industrial composting services become more available, compostable plastics have a role to play in a more sustainable future. Until those services are more widely available, consumers trying to do the best they can for the planet may want to reach for bamboo, wooden, paper, or cardboard alternatives. And, of course,if you aren’t composting yet, consider starting!","text",11

To keep gardens and food supplies healthy, pollen is needed. Pollinating animals include birds, bats, butterflies, beetles, and most importantly, bees! Pollination occurs through self-pollination by wind or water or through the help of bees. Bees transport pollen from flower to flower after drinking the nectar from a flower.

Our goal is to educate citizens, create homes for bees, butterflies, birds and other pollinators, and encourage others to foster a safe environment for them. Pollinators are crucial to life on Earth because they allow plants to reproduce through pollination. If there are no pollinators, then we lose certain flowers, plants, and foods. Without them, our ecosystem is in trouble. What is HAP Hive doing? 1. Reduce Use of Chemical Pesticides2. Increase Natural Habitat and Food Sources with Pollinator Gardens3.

Factory Farm Cruelty The U.S. is ranked the number one meat eating country in the world. That requires a massive production of meat each year. The USDA reports that 9.76 billion land animals were killed in 2020. 99%of all farm animals in the U.S. live in factory farms, also referred to as concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). Farm animals are also the mostabused animalson the planet. CAFOs are purposely kept away from public view because of their mistreatment of animals (out of sight, out of mind). CAFOs keep the vast majority of their animals in dirty, cramped conditions. These animals are denied even the most basic of needs, often including the ability to turn around. In their short lives, these animals are bred, mutilated, and pumped full of additives and antibiotics. They’re living and dying in a way that is not natural.

HAP’s Compassionate Events program recognizes organizations that exclusively serve vegan and/or vegetarian meals according to a Gold, Silver, and Bronze level. Our Gold Partners have committed to a complete plant-based menu (no meat, fish, dairy, or eggs) at events hosted by their organization. Our Silver Partners have committed to a vegetarian menu (no meat or fish) at their events. Finally, our Bronze Partners have committed to providing at least one vegetarian/vegan option at their events.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/mural","Born just twelve miles from downtown Pittsburgh, Jeremy Michael Raymer’s early connection to art grew in childhood watching Bob Ross painting happy little trees and continued into young adulthood attending several studio courses as an undergrad. However, he never gave much thought to a career path as an artist, so he attended the University of Pittsburgh and graduated with a degree in Bioengineering in 2004. Returning again in 2010 for a second degree in Electrical Engineering, Jeremy spent the decade as a professional in various science and engineering disciplines. It was during this time he was living in San Francisco where he was inspired to take up painting in his spare time. During the first 7 years of exploration, Jeremy used oils and brushes to create small-scale works. After visiting Wynwood Walls near Miami in 2013, he experienced a display of large scale murals like he had never seen before. Their diverse styles, sheer number and eclectic combination of genres inspired him to try it. He purchased his first can of spray paint as soon as he returned home. It wasn’t long before he realized this medium allowed him to considerably increase the speed and surface area of his projects as well as drastically expand his color palette. Considering his murals as very large drawings, his approach evokes a sense of intimacy with the viewer— each piece unique and rich with emotion particularly within portraits and eyes. In 2016 Jeremy walked away from financial security as a Senior Test Engineer and committed his efforts to work as a professional artist full time. Now, every waking moment is dedicated to propel his craft forward. Constantly working to develop his abilities and become one of the most notable muralists in Pittsburgh, each of Jeremy’s pieces outshines the last. He is influenced by his experience as a scientist, along with current events, pop culture, and antique photography.","text",7

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-2023-pittsburgh-vegan-expo/","Amy Marie Cottrill, owner and founder ofpittsburghvegan.comand the organizer of the Pittsburgh Vegan Expo took time out of her busy schedule to answer some questions for me. Q:How and when did you start hosting vegan events? I began hosting vegan events when I was in high school, in the mid-90s, when I started my school’s environmental club and began hosting vegan luncheons for the club members and staff. Around that time, I also began hosting animal rights fundraiser events. In 1997, I hosted the first Multi-Culture Fest, outside of school, which changed names as it grew over the years, into what is today’s Original Pittsburgh Vegan Festival & Expo. Multi-Culture Fest introduced people in a closed-minded area of the city where I lived then, to vegan food, dance, music, and arts from various countries and cultures, to help open their minds through the fun of food and performances. The first event went so well, I started moving it to other parts of the city, to expand the audiences we were reaching, to include everyone, and to help the event grow. I also ran various other vegan events, including wellness events (I used to be a massage therapist), and the RE-Model Gala, an event where local artists are each paired up with a belly dancer (I’m also a professional belly dancer and master instructor) to create a costume for the dancer to model and perform in, during an eco-fashion show and art contest. The pieces are created using all reused, recycled, recyclable, compostable, or otherwise eco-friendly materials. All vegan food is served at the Gala. As all of my small events grew, I started to combine them. I combined Multi-Culture Fest with RE-Model Gala, to create Vegan Bazaar, which grew until the name changed to Pittsburgh Vegan Festival, as we had been outgrowing each venue and there was a need to make it a big festival, due to size, and since our city did not have one yet. Q:How many events do you do in a year and how do they differ?","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-2023-pittsburgh-vegan-expo/","I currently host two to five vegan events per month, some small events, and some big festivals. Still, that number is growing, too, as they are all over Pittsburgh and Greater Pittsburgh, and each event differs in location, attraction, and audience. Each event supports small business vendors, offering vegan-friendly items and food, with a wide variety of themes for different events, such as Metaphysical, Horror Art, Holiday Gifts, Pets, Fashion, Environmental, and much more. Some events include entertainment, which varies per event, but includes anything from yoga, to cultural dance and live music of various genres, to beatboxing and breakdance, or Pagan Sabbat crafting (such as guests creating fresh flower crowns for Beltane). This year, we have three major vegan festivals:","text",6
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-2023-pittsburgh-vegan-expo/","https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/vegfestdates-300x300.png","image",7
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-2023-pittsburgh-vegan-expo/","I recently expanded to do so many events that I was looking for some people to partner with, for some new events, in addition to keeping my events going and growing. I am so lucky to have found Kimmy Addison, Personal Trainer, as she is a breeze to work with, and we began a whole new co-organized series of vegan pop-up events at breweries all over the city, often with fun themes such as Horror Art. Those events are very different from the events I already had established! I will also be working on new, separate events with others. After spending my entire adult life so far, working solo on planning these events, it has been fun to co-organize some new events as well. Most of my/our events are in some way a fundraiser for animals. Q:How has veganism in Pittsburgh developed over the years? What trends are you noticing? When I hosted my first event in the 90s, almost nobody in my area of the city knew the word “vegan” before they met me. They thought vegetarian meant I only ate lettuce, or that I ate lettuce with a hamburger! I had become vegetarian, then later vegan, at a young age, so most of my childhood I knew there was no food for me anywhere except my own home, where my mom would cook for me. Most restaurant visits were hard, as most servers also did not know the word, nor did they serve vegan options other than a basic salad of lettuce, a piece of tomato, and maybe some shredded carrot, if you were lucky (unless you knew to go to an Indian or Mediterranean restaurant). For many, many years, Zenith was the only vegetarian restaurant in the city, and a lot of mainstream people didn’t know it was there. They are still standing! I hosted some of my first vegan/animal rights events at Zenith in the 90s – fundraiser dinners to benefit organizations against vivisection, back when the previous owner and her dog owned the place!","text",8
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-2023-pittsburgh-vegan-expo/","There were vegan events in Pittsburgh here and there, hosted by others (friends/activists), but they weren’t consistent/long-running, nor very large. Over the years, as my events grew, so did Pittsburgh, and the number of vegans here! So, over the many years, I’ve watched it develop – we went from a city where restaurants would bring me lettuce, to a city where it’s very easy to find vegan options at restaurants all over! It’s an amazing thing to have witnessed over many years.","text",9
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-2023-pittsburgh-vegan-expo/","One huge change I loved seeing, is the vegan cheese situation! During my whole childhood, and some of my adulthood, I had to order pizza with no cheese, and hear comments from everyone in the room, about how weird I am! In the late 90s, one store had a “vegan cheese” made of tofu…but, they may as well have just called it “flavorless, retextured tofu”. It was not cheese-like at all. Years later, Daiya shocked the vegan world, and at first, a small number of pizza places started using it, including in Pittsburgh. It didn’t take long for many companies to jump in the vegan cheese money war, each company trying to outdo the others with the best, new vegan cheese! Suddenly, quickly, Pittsburgh had so many pizza places offering vegan cheese, and various brands, which do not all taste alike, so each person could find one they like.  I made a list of all the pizza places in Pittsburgh with vegan cheese options, and was shocked at how long the list has become! Q:What is your favorite part of hosting all these vegan events? I love that my daughter gets to experience the result, rather than the struggle. She is 11, vegan since birth, and is now learning to plan her vegan events! I take her to all my events, so it makes my events even more fun for me, knowing my daughter will never have to struggle with finding food or being understood as a vegan, the way I did as a child. Another favorite part of hosting these events is, I love to support more and more small businesses, performers, and artists, as that has always been an important part of all of this, from the start. It is especially important to me, after such a long shut-down, to not only bounce back, but to do it full force, and bring everyone else with me. It’s so great to see businesses thriving again. Equally as important, from the start, is introducing more and more people, in more and more areas, to vegan food and the arts, so fewer animals are harmed, more people become aware, and more artists can thrive.","text",10
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-2023-pittsburgh-vegan-expo/","Q:If you had one chance to convince someone to go vegan, what would you say?","text",11
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-2023-pittsburgh-vegan-expo/","We are only here a short while, but the earth has been here much longer, and we need to preserve, rather than destroy it. Just as we don’t want to be hurt, or die, neither do the other animals. Eating them not only kills them and the earth, but it kills the human eating them, slowly. Eating the pain and fear preserved in their bodies during their murder is not good for us, nor is the cholesterol, hormones, toxins, etc. On a lighter note, I’d also say, vegan food rocks. Q:What can attendees expect at this year’s Vegan Expo on July 8th and 9th? July 8 at Monroeville Convention Center will have more than 130 vendors, food and dessert booths and trucks, juiceries, artists, products, wellness, metaphysical booths, and much more. It will feature a harp concert, dance classes (hip hop and poppin’), belly dancers, a yoga class, live painters, kids’ activities, a caricature artist, a henna artist, and more. A portion of the proceeds will benefit Humane Action Pittsburgh and the little rescue dogs of Among the Wildflowers Sanctuary. July 9 at Lolev Beer in Lawrenceville, is a much smaller, more intimate event, with a couple of food trucks, and around 10 artists and vendors. It will be entertainment-based, featuring 4X N. American Beatbox Champion (Villain), PyurTek of Get Down Gang (Poppin’ Dance Performance), and the Pittsburgh-famous child BGirl SupaRare (breakdancer). DJ TJ Harris will DJ a dance party with hip-hop, funk, house music, and more. All are welcome to both events, all ages (with parents), vegans and non-vegans. Thanks again to Amy for taking the time to answer my questions. I encourage anyone reading this to come on out to the Monroeville Convention Center on July 8thand see what Pittsburgh’s vegan scene has to offer. Tickets are $5.00 and go toward supporting the artists and the sponsors of the event, including HAP! For more information, please visit the event site onFacebook.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/hip-hip-hooray-for-hap/","Hip Hip Hooray for HAP! byKelly Frantz|Mar 7, 2023 I’d like to give a big shout out to our very own HAP family! It all started way back in 2015 with one man, Brian Bonsteel, DMD. He understood that education and policy change are essential to solving animal rights issues which are too monumental for rescue to confront alone. Brian, along with Natalie Ahwesh, Sam Ahwesh, and Mario Costanzo dove headfirst into making HAP come alive. The vision they began working for and diligently continue to work for is a world without animal suffering and where all beings are treated with compassion. Their collective mission, along with the rest of the growing HAP family, is to improve the protection of all animals by empowering people to make an impact through education, policy and community action.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/hip-hip-hooray-for-hap/","This shared vision came to fruition through several effective methods. One of the primary ways HAP has garnered success is through educating themselves and the community about critical animal welfare issues and also offering practical solutions. HAP believes in starting education early and so developed interactive classes which are offered to schools both in person and via zoom. Class highlights include: HAP’s success is also achieved through building relationships with those who share the same vision as well as collaborating with a community of colleagues, legislators, and business leaders. But the true testament to HAP’s continued success is their commitment to their team and fulfilling HAP’s mission. And all the hard work over the years has paid off in quite a significant way! One monumental victory is the Bullhook Plus Ban. This prohibits the use of bullhooks, electric prods, shocking devices, hacksaws, ankuses, baseball bats, ax handles, pitchforks, whips, sticks, muzzles, and other instruments capable of inflicting pain, intimidating, or threatening pain to control wild or exotic animals including lions, tigers, bears, and monkeys in the city of Pittsburgh. I wanted to include specifics on this ban because I don’t know about you, but I wouldn’t have realized that things like pitchforks and baseball bats needed to be included. It really shines a light on the brutality these animals go through and eventually lead to the Shrine Circus, Garden Brothers, Ringling Brothers, and others, ceasing performances in the city of Pittsburgh.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/hip-hip-hooray-for-hap/","The term “puppy mill” has become synonymous with the poor treatment of our canine friends, so HAP set to work and was able to get a ban passed which prohibits the retail sale of dogs, cats, and rabbits that are not from a shelter or rescue within city limits. Here are just SOME of the conditions dogs live under in many puppy mills. The HAP team understands that becoming an ally to animals can also be beneficial to our health! That is why they successfully created and implemented Get Healthy Pittsburgh!, a program that supported the residents of Pittsburgh to improve their health with a step-by-step guide to eating a plant-based diet for one week. Participants were coached daily on how to prepare balanced meals, short cut food preparation, and incorporate more activity into their lives in less time. At the end of the week, everyone who participated was met with real success as shown in the number of pounds lost and improved triglycerides and LDL. The average pounds lost was 4.5, average improvement for triglycerides was 9 points and the average improvement for LDL was 13 points. HAP has achieved many victories over the years and continues to make headway in the fight against animal cruelty with ongoing campaigns like HAP Hive. The goal of this campaign is to combat the disappearing bee population by eliminating Pittsburgh’s use of chemical pesticides, replacing ornamental flowers with native plants, and producing and installing “bee hotels” where natural habitats have been destroyed. Another important campaign, Love Your Wild Neighbor, educates residents of Allegheny County and beyond on humane harassment techniques that serve as an alternative to trapping raccoons, groundhogs, skunks, and other wildlife that may be considered pests.","text",7

Pittsburgh Bag Plastic Ban In an effort to promote a cleaner and more sustainable community by reducing the use of single-use plastics, the City of Pittsburgh unanimously passed a Plastic Bag Ban in April 2022. As ofOctober 14th, 2023, all retail establishments (grocery stores, restaurants, convenience stores, big box stores, etc.) operating within the City of Pittsburgh are prohibited from providing a single-use plastic bag or a non-recycled paper bag to a customer at checkout or through delivery. Retailers were given a grace period to draw down their existing plastic bag inventory until January 1st, 2024. This grace period has ended and retailers are expected to no longer provide plastic carryout bags to customers.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wildlife-killing-contests-barbaric-cruel-and-unnecessary/","Within Pennsylvania, hunting is a way of life. Every year, millions of residents trek into the woods to find that perfect specimen to bring home. Hunting is so ingrained in the lifeblood of Pennsylvania, many schools close for the first day of deer season. There is a sinister side to this, however, and unfortunately, it is very prevalent in Pennsylvania (see map below), and Pennsylvania has more of these events than any other state. Wildlife Killing Contests (WKCs) are events where participants are encouraged to shoot and kill as many of a specific animal, usually an apex predator like coyotes or bobcats, and the one who kills the most wins. Participants use calling devices meant to mimic the sounds of an animal in distress to bring the animals close to them, and then shoot. During this frenzy to bag as many animals as possible, pregnant females and babies are targeted, as they can potentially be worth more points. At the end of the contest, the corpses of the animals are left to rot within a field, while the participants celebrate their efforts at an after party.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wildlife-killing-contests-barbaric-cruel-and-unnecessary/","WKCs violate the tenet of the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation that states wildlife may only be killed for legitimate, non-frivolous purposes. This cruel activity is not hunting, and has been decried by conservationists as well as hunting organizations who feel WKCs go against the rules of hunting. Proponents of WKCs claims that this helps with wildlife management, but there are no studies that show that to be true. In fact, it may lead to a higher population of the species after the temporary reduction.  WKCs create instability and chaos in coyote family structure, which allows more coyotes to reproduce, encourages the immigration of outside coyotes seeking the space and resources and can increase conflicts with livestock. Arizona, California, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Colorado, and Vermont have outlawed WKCs and several other states are considering similar action. Humane Action Pittsburgh (HAP) would like Pennsylvania to be next. We are teaming up withAnimal Wellness Actionto bring awareness of this barbaric activity to all citizens and help put a stop to this cruelty.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-intersection-of-social-work-and-animal-welfare/","The Intersection of Social Work and Animal Welfare byJennifer Thomas|Mar 30, 2022 A victim of domestic violence chooses to stay in an abusive situation because they do not want to leave their companion animal behind to be harmed. A veteran experiencing homelessness is forced to surrender their service dog because there are no pet friendly shelters. An older adult can’t stay to receive treatment at the hospital because there is no one to watch over their cats during their recovery. These are just a few of the intersecting and tragic situations involving animals, their humans, and complex social issues. Social Work has historically and exclusively focused on the human members of society without much concern for how the lives of animals intersect. Today, companion animals are widely present in U.S households with an estimated57% of homes owning a pet. Animal welfare penetrates a variety of social work specialties and societal issues. Focusing more on our non-human members of society does not crowd out humans, but rather it increases and enriches our capacity toserve. The Human-Animal Relationship Humans and animals share an amazingly special bond. Paying close attention to the human-animal relationship can assist social workers in the delivery of services, including identifying risks and resiliency factors, promoting social and environmental justice, and expanding attention to all vulnerable members ofsociety. Service animals, emotional support animals, comfort dogs, and animal-assisted therapy animals are just a few of the ways that animals have a round impact on clinical social work practice.","text",3
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-intersection-of-social-work-and-animal-welfare/","There are manyhealth benefitsof human-animal interactions across the lifespan that social workers ought to be aware of, such as slowing the development of chronic illness, decreasing loneliness and depression, and improving physical fitness, to name a few.  These benefits are especially important for older adults and those at risk of social isolation.Pets can offer older adults a vital source of companionship and emotional support. Caring for a pet may be a strong motivator for a client to have a daily routine, get exercise, and be involved in the community. The animal may be a last link to a deceased spouse and serve as an important resiliency factor against depression and other mental health issues. Social workers help older adults age in place with their pets as well establish services for pet owners in need of medical care or long term hospitalization where they can foster or temporarily house their pets until they return home.","text",4
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-intersection-of-social-work-and-animal-welfare/","Another vulnerable group of individuals that social workers frequently work with are those experiencing homelessness or housing instability. Nearly 3.5million Americanswho experience homelessness annually have dogs and cats that provide emotional support, safety, a sense of responsibility, and combat loneliness. Because most homeless shelters do not allow pets, these restrictions deter pet owners from seeking out shelters and stabilizing resources. TheStreet Dog Coalition, operating in over 50 cities across the country, is committed to protecting the human-animal bond and caring for both animals and humans.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-intersection-of-social-work-and-animal-welfare/","Social workers must use this knowledge to inform their engagement, assessment, and intervention with their clients. Simply asking clients about their animals can assist with building rapport and trust and yield significant insights into the well-being of the household. For children in particular, companion animals assist with feelings of safety, unconditional love, and contribute to cognitive, emotional, and languagedevelopment. Animal-child relationships could also signal to the social worker that further assessment of family issues must be explored.The relationships between humans and animals in a household arestrong indicatorsof the safety of the people in that household. Social Workers in Animal Shelters Animal Shelters have often operated in isolation from human service agencies and other non-profit organizations concerned with the well-being of human beings. This can lead to the silo effect in whichcross-disciplinary collaborationrarely happens, leaving gaps in service for humans and animals. Social workers can facilitate bridging segregated service systems by promoting interdisciplinary communication and intervention that promote human-animal relationships. Animal shelter workers are also at a disproportionate risk of secondary trauma, compassion fatigue, andburnout. Positioning social workers within animal shelters is one strategy to help alleviate the stress associated with this occupation. With the understanding that there is an inextricable link between domestic violence and animal abuse, animal shelters and domestic violence shelters can form partnerships that open pathways for survivors to receive help.Victims of domestic violence may delay leaving abusive situations, fearing their companion animals’ safety. In no situation should a survivor have to choose between their own safety and the safety of their pets. As can be seen, there are many untapped social work opportunities within animal shelters that have yet to be explored.","text",9

Veterinary Social Workers help their clients with grief and pet loss, animal-assisted interactions, researching the link between human and animal issues, advocating for public policy as well as providing compassion fatigue management for veterinary staff. This field provides training and licensing for social workers interested in working with both humans and animals concurrently.Learn more about this emerging fieldhere.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-intersection-of-social-work-and-animal-welfare/","Animal Rights is a Social Justice Issue Social workers or anyone committed to social justice must consider the interests ofall beings, not only humans. Let’s look at a few reasons why animal rights fall under the purview of social work. Animal agriculture has been hurting vulnerable populations since its inception. The meat, dairy, and egg industry not onlyexploits animals, but also their workers who are often primarily immigrants or people of color. Further, animal agriculture is one of the leading contributors toserious environmental challengessuch as climate change and loss of biodiversity.As a profession dedicated to supporting the most vulnerable, social workers can play a key role in thefight for environmental justice, helping to prevent and address the consequences of climate change through advocacy, community action, and research. Animals often fall victim to violence with no one to represent the interests of the animal. To remedy this,Courtroom Animal Advocate Program(CAAP), laws have been introduced in many states. CAAP laws allow advocates to speak for animal victims in criminal cruelty cases and make recommendations on behalf of the animal. Consider watching thisshort filmthat speaks to the importance of giving animals a voice. Food insecurity impacts millions of Americans and their pets living at or below the poverty line and in communities with limited resources every year. Animal advocates across the country are lobbying for Congress to take action and revise the definition of food covered bySNAP to include pet food. This is another example of the unique intersection of issues where social workers are key players in making long lasting change for pets and their families. Issues that impact humans and animals cannot simply be managed by micro level intervention. Legislation and social policy are critical pieces of the puzzle. Social workers must advocate for public policy that improves the lives and well-being of all beings.","text",13
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-intersection-of-social-work-and-animal-welfare/","With human concerns largely ruling the purview of legislative issues, it is critical to educate lawmakers on this undeniable link for human well-being. Let your elected officials know about the issues and begin a dialogue on how your state can strengthen and enforce stronger laws to protect animals and humans.","text",14
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-intersection-of-social-work-and-animal-welfare/","Social workers should sign up for newsletters from theAnimal Legal Defense Fundand other organizations such asAnimal Wellness Action,The National Link Coalition, andHumane Action Pittsburghto learn about the latest action items that will better protect animals and the people they serve. The inclusion of human–animal relationships should be considered more widely in training, practice, and professional code of ethics as part of social work’s commitment to social and environmental justice.Social workers should care about the well-being of ALL living beings, as we are aware of the profound relationship that exists between animals and their humans.","text",15

Many of us in Pittsburgh have enjoyed hikes on theRachel Carson Trail, and all of us in the U.S. have benefitted from Carson’s environmental advocacy, which is largely credited with the discontinuation of the use of DDT, a chemical that contributed to the death of many birds.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/protecting-rachel-carsons-legacy-in-pittsburgh-by-protecting-pittsburghs-pigeons/","Photo Credit:Rhettwpon Flickr AsThe Last Archive puts it, “In the spring of 1958, when the winter snow melted and the warm sun returned, the birds did not. Birdwatchers, ordinary people, everyone wondered where the birds had gone. Rachel Carson, a journalist and early environmentalist, figured it out — they’d been poisoned by DDT, a pesticide that towns all over the country had been spraying.” While Carson was able to contribute to the prohibition of DDT, her work also contributed to other vital legislation that protects birds and other wildlife (as well as humans) from pollution and other dangers. The episode stood out to me, though, because it described an important battle that Carson hadn’t been able to win–a battle that sounded eerily familiar. Carson’s work was too little, too late to save the carrier pigeon, who had been the victim not just of environmental toxins, but simple over-hunting. This sounded familiar and particularly poignant because, right here, in the Pittsburgh region, Rachel Carson’s old stomping-ground, a fight for the well-being of another pigeon is under way.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/protecting-rachel-carsons-legacy-in-pittsburgh-by-protecting-pittsburghs-pigeons/","As WPXI reported inDecember, at least one company responsible for pest control in Pittsburgh may have been engaged in the illegal practice of pigeon poisoning as a method of pest control. WPXI reported that “In March, a law passed in the city of Pittsburgh made it illegal to harm wild birds, such as pigeons, in any way,” and while the pest control company in question “is not local and says that’s why it didn’t get the letter” and that “As soon as they learned about the new ordinance, a company spokesperson said it immediately stopped,” the whole story got me thinking about why pest control companies would want to poison pigeons to begin with. I reached out to Cheryl Mosco, a fellow HAP member and pigeon expert who works withpalomacy, a volunteer-organization dedicated to protecting pigeons and doves. Cheryl was able to explain best practices employed in a number of cities (and some organizations in Pittsburgh) for humane methods to deter pigeons from becoming a nuisance. But, as she points out, pigeons pose no real threat to property owners, residents, or downtown workers. For those who seek to deter pigeons for aesthetic reasons, she recommended hardware cloth or other structural deterrents to prevent pigeons (or rock doves) from nesting in these tall buildings that resemble their natural habitats in cliffs.","text",7

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/protecting-rachel-carsons-legacy-in-pittsburgh-by-protecting-pittsburghs-pigeons/","Photo byJosé DuarteonUnsplash Some people might wonder what the harm in poisoning pigeons might be–after all, many exterminators and residents poison other pests such as rats. While, of course, HAP would discourage the use of poison to deter any sentient creatures, even those considered pests, the reasons to avoid poisoning pigeons (or other pests, for that matter) transcend the desire to respect the life of the animal considered a pest. For one thing, poisoning provides animals with an especially cruel–not to mention horrifying–death. As this 2020 National Geographicarticleexplains, “Avitrol, an EPA-registered bird pesticide, often causes birds to fall to the ground, convulse, and die—a reaction that horrifies onlookers,” and while the pesticide is not illegal, it is– understandably– banned in a number of cities. Also of note, HAP and others are currently working to convince the EPA to ban avitrol–a vital move they are considering. Additionally, consider the WPXI story about the birds found in Pittsburgh suspected of having been poisoned. The article reports that “A woman walking spotted at least 10 pigeons on the ground outside the Frick Building.” Consider the implications of these birds, recently poisoned, flailing about on the ground on a heavily-trafficked sidewalk. They are easy targets for predators such as feral cats or birds of prey, such as the well-belovedPitt Peregrine Falcons. These predators, after consuming poisoned doves or pigeons, can consume the poisons as well. Additionally, imagine the pedestrians out with their dogs who might stumble across these birds, or lap up contaminated water. As the National Geographic article points out, “Avitrol is toxic to all vertebrates.” Imagine caring for a sick dog and never knowing that their sickness or even death might be the result of accidental poisoning.","text",11

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/protecting-rachel-carsons-legacy-in-pittsburgh-by-protecting-pittsburghs-pigeons/","It’s worth noting that the danger to companion animals is a great reason not to use poison as a method of pest control for any animal. It’s also worth noting that the danger to pigeons today is not demonstrably different from the dangers Carrier Pigeons faced in Carson’s day. Pennsylvania is the only remaining state to openly and legally permit pigeon shoots, a relic that would likely make Carson cringe were she to know it remained today. While Pittsburgh has taken steps such as the March 2020 law making it illegal to harm wild birds, it’s important that such laws be vigilantly enforced. It’s also important that the general public understand that pigeons pose no danger to them and are related to the much-beloved doves we consider a symbol of peace and freedom.","text",13

These gardens, strategically planted across the community, provide essential habitats for bees, butterflies, and other pollinators that play a crucial role in our ecosystem. By creating these vibrant sanctuaries, we not only beautify our neighborhoods but also contribute to the health of our local flora and food systems.Join usin celebrating this significant achievement and our ongoing commitment to a greener, healthier future for all. Swissvale Community Pollinator Garden Our first step in HAP Hive has been to create a pollinator garden. Humane Action Pittsburgh, in partnership with the Swissvale Borough Council, is installing a pollinator garden in a previously vacant lot in Swissvale. The 12,000 square feet of space will serve as an oasis for bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. Volunteers from HAP, the Shade Tree Committee, and the community have helped lay the groundwork for this project during monthly work days. Volunteers have helped clean up litter, clear debris, seed, prune, fertilize, plant trees, and dig a drainage trench.

She was a young woman that had many passions, including the health and long-term welfare of the global environment for all creatures. Daisy had an unforgettable sense of humor and spoke intelligently with great gusto about the importance of bees for all.“Although small, they are mighty” when it comes to human health. Her last conversation with a loved one, just before her death, included a lengthy discussion about bees, their importance in the world, and the impacts on the human food chain. Daisy died unexpectedly at the age of 20 from an accidental overdose in Fort Collins, Colorado, where she went to pursue a degree in Environmental Science. She died just a couple of months before planning to move back home to Pittsburgh to live in Edgewood with loved ones.While sustaining the impact of Daisy’s loss, her loved ones have also understood it is with honor and unconditional love for Daisy that they continue Daisy’s legacy by supporting her passion for bee pollination.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/regional-initiatives/freedom-for-fish/","Freedom for Fish The world’s fish are suffering. Whether caught for food or to be kept as pets, entire fish populations are struggling to either stay alive or live their best lives in their natural habitat — lives that extend to old age, where they remember interactions with each other and show affection by rubbing up against one another, much like humans cuddle each other and their dogs or cats. Although they can’t scream or cry in a way we recognize, fish DO have feelings. They suffer and feel pain, usually at the hands of humans. They’re sentient creatures who can become bored or frustrated when kept in tiny tanks or aquariums for human amusement. In such conditions, they feel lonely, cramped, and far from home–theirrealhome, where they can swim the many miles a day they are accustomed to and can finish their bubble hut they began to build for their babies before they were cruelly scooped up and captured.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/regional-initiatives/freedom-for-fish/","Photo byRiddhiman BhowmikonUnsplash Problem According toPETA, fish “have nervous systems and react to painful stimuli the same way all animals do –their breathing rate increases, their muscles contract, and they try to escape.” So when fish in the wild are caught using longline fishing techniques or exposed to a small puff of cyanide to stun and capture them live (an illegal practice called“cyanide fishing”), their panic and pain is similar to what any other animal would feel in the same conditions. Wild fish are caught and transported to bekept unnaturally as petsfrom all around the world, with pet stores being the main offenders. Even if they manage to escape the net (which in itself is stressful), the resulting shock and treacherous travel weakens them. The fishing industryalso contributes to their suffering, wherein fish are caught, not as pets, but to be eaten. The Facts 90% of fish in aquariums are caught in the wild, with 95% of saltwater fish sold in pet shops coming from their homes and natural lives in Fiji, Indonesia, the Philippines, and other Pacific Islands. More than 20 million fish are captured from the wild every year to support a $300 million worldwide “hobby,” according toPETA. According toForbes, “it has been estimated that between .97 to 2.7 trillion fish” are slaughtered each year for human consumption. Bycatch–where marine species who are not the intended victims of the commercial fishing industry are scooped up into huge fishing nets accidentally, and injured and killed in the process– is another issue. Global bycatch may amount to 40% of the world’s catch, totalling 63 billion pounds per year, according toOceana’s report.NOAA Fisheriesshed light on the unfortunate subject: “Fishermen sometimes catch and discard animals they do not want, cannot sell, or are not allowed to keep.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/regional-initiatives/freedom-for-fish/","This is collectively known as ‘bycatch.’ Bycatch can be fish, but also includes other animals such as dolphins, whales, sea turtles, and seabirds that become hooked or entangled in fishing gear. For NOAA Fisheries, bycatch refers to ‘discarded catch of marine species and unobserved mortality due to a direct encounter with fishing vessels and gear.’ These unintentionally caught animals often suffer injuries or die.”","text",6

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/regional-initiatives/freedom-for-fish/","What Is HAP Doing About It? Educating the public of the inhumane treatment fish encounter when caught from the wild to be imprisoned in tiny tanks as pets or killed for food is our first step. Awareness is key while fighting for the lives of fish, who are capable of remembering past social interactions with other fish and show affection by rubbing up against one another. Through ourBetter for Betta Fishcampaign, we’re working with pet stores to stop the sale of betta fish as pets, leaving them in their natural habitat to thrive. Our“No Plastic Please”campaign also benefits humans and fish (and other animals!) by reducing unnecessary single-use plastic waste.  We hope to reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in oceans, eliminating risk to ALL species and keeping plastic from littering our communities and waterways. How You Can Help Find out more about the horrors of the fishing industryand share this information with people you know. Assist in educating pet stores where you see injured, sick, or abused fish if you feel comfortable doing so. Swap out meals that include fish for plant-based options. Yourdonationcan also help us save fish from suffering or early death by funding us to educate and inspire the next generation on this important issue.","text",10

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/hunting-within-city-limits-asking-for-trouble/","Hunting Within City Limits – Asking for Trouble? byAimee Douglass|Sep 13, 2022 When it comes to hunting, the vision most of us have in our heads is that of bright-orange clad hunters out in the remote woods of Western and Central Pennsylvania, but this is not always the case. Did you know that Pennsylvania’s hunting laws allow for inner city hunting?HAP member Louis Depellegrini did not, and was shocked by what he witnessed in his backyard, as described below in his own words: “I never knew that inner city hunting was permitted in cities until I captured two hunters on my digital camera tracking deer on a neighboring public elementary school one Saturday morning. I saw them from my bedroom window. They had bows and arrows; did not wear proper attire and were several feet from a busy street and a pedestrian sidewalk. There were rows of residential homes below with backyards where pets or kids could have been. Unsuspecting people or pets could be in an unsafe situation; what if mistaken for a deer. Plus an arrow or a bullet have no way to stop if a deer target is missed.”","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/hunting-within-city-limits-asking-for-trouble/","Image courtesy of GrowPittsburgh.org Like Louis, I did not realize that hunting within city limits was allowed by Pennsylvania’s hunting in that it is not strictly forbidden. There are no regulations that specify where hunting should occur, except for the following: Safety Zones:It is unlawful to hunt for, shoot at, trap, take, chase ordisturb wildlife within 150 yards of any occupied residence, camp, industrialor commercial building, farm house or farm building, or school orplayground without the permission of the occupants. It is unlawful to shootinto a safety zone, even if you are outside of the zone. Driving game, evenwithout a firearm or bow, within a safety zone without permission is unlawful.For comparison, think of a safety zone as about one and a halffootballfields. Hunting on hospital and institutional grounds, and in cemeteries,is also prohibited. It is unlawful to discharge a firearm within 150yards of a Game Commission vehicle whose occupants are releasing pheasants.The safety zone forarchery huntersstatewide is50 yards. This alsoapplies to crossbows during any season where they can be used. Archeryhunters carrying muzzleloaders during any muzzleloader season must abideby the 150-yard safety zone regulation. Around playgrounds, schools, nurseryschools or day-care centers, the safety zone remains 150 yards. I, too, have seen hunters, not on my property, but within close proximity to the PA Turnpike, which I have a view of from my backyard. The familiar site of orange safety gear fills me with dread every time I take my three dogs out. If I can see them, can they see me and the dogs and discern that we are not targets? I trust that we are probably safely outside of the bounds of the guns’ capabilities as far as distance, but what if we’re not?And what of other areas? I have seen hunters walking along Lincoln Avenue in the Lincoln-Lemington section of the city, not far from East Liberty, Highland Park, and other areas with high density populations.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/hunting-within-city-limits-asking-for-trouble/","It was obvious that they were hunting within the cemetery along Lincoln Avenue, but there are quite a few houses that surround the cemetery itself – who or what will protect the residents of those buildings?","text",6
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/hunting-within-city-limits-asking-for-trouble/","Besides the potential damage to people and pets, hunting has been shown to not curb the deer populations in our neighborhoods. In fact, studies have shown that the deer population has steadily risen over the past several years. As suburban sprawl continues to rise, leading to more development on what was once open land, deer encounters have risen, leading many to want to cull deer in order to protect their property such as cars, or gardens. However, this is the price of living in such an area – sharing it with the wildlife that was there before. Allowing hunting so close to areas where adults, children, and domestic animals are present makes the idea of hunting within city limits that much more dangerous than any threat that the deer might pose.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/look-and-see-the-litter-with-litterati/","Look and See the Litter With Litterati byHannah Lewis|Sep 14, 2020 Before the COVID-19 pandemic really took hold here in the U.S., most of us will remember a zero waste movement gaining traction. The city of Pittsburgh has aplanto move towards a zero-waste standard. Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Garden has racked upaccoladesfor its green and zero waste practices. Humane Action Pittsburgh has participated in this global movement with our“No Plastic Please”campaign. The link between the reduction in single-use plastics and animal welfare may not be immediately clear to some, but HAP’s goal is to reduce harm to marine life impacted by plastic waste while also protecting drinking water and the environment for humans. I can’t speak for everyone, but, for me, reducing my reliance on plastic has become a bit of an afterthought in the era of COVID-19. Since March, stores have discouraged or banned the use of reusable shopping bags, the bulk bins I used to frequent are emptied out or taped up, takeout is far more prevalent, and, sadly, other concerns have been taking up more and more of my mental and emotional real estate. I even delayed participation in thePittsburgh Summer 10K Litter Challenge, but, in July, when my partner and I moved from a suburban apartment in Allison Park to our new home in Pittsburgh’s Observatory Hill neighborhood, I started to notice how much litter accumulated on the sidewalks off busy roads near us. IfinallydownloadedLitterati, an app that allows users to document litter. At times, the aggregated data can be used to push for corporate or even policy-based changes. After downloading the app, I noticed something. Even when I didn’t have my phone with me, I became more aware of the litter I saw–and I was surprised how prevalent it was! The most startling part of the experience occurred when I was hiking in Ohiopyle State Park over Labor Day Weekend.","text",3
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/look-and-see-the-litter-with-litterati/","Fern Cliff Trail is a favorite of mine because you can hear and see the incredible Youghiogheny River and Ohiopyle’s signature waterfall while hiking in a unique forested area.","text",4

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/look-and-see-the-litter-with-litterati/","Photo courtesy ofClaire Kmetz Walking onto theFerncliff Peninsula, hikers are greeted with a plaque indicating that the peninsula is a National Natural Landmark. The river gorge creates a microclimate that is quite uncommon in the region and home to many unique plants and animals. Us humans regularly use the river for water recreation, too, including swimming. The importance of preserving the purity of the land and water–for the sake of the environment broadly as well as humans and animals specifically–hit me hard on this particular occasion specifically because of how aware I had become of the prevalence of litter. As we hiked, I kept a sharp eye out, and I noticed almost immediately a number of plastics, including small items like bottle caps and cigarette butts, as well as larger items like water bottles and, fittingly for Summer of 2020, a broken surgical mask.","text",6

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/look-and-see-the-litter-with-litterati/","Photo courtesy ofClaire Kmetz I know that removing these items will have little impact on the overall health of the forest and the unique ecosystem on the peninsula. But the power of a tool like Litterati became salient to me as I realized that documenting this littercould, in fact, provide the data to hold companies responsible for the amount of litter their products contain, to generate or nurture the political willpower needed to enforce rules against litter, and to generally make people aware of the danger not only to unique and vulnerable animal species, but also more broadly to these cherished local landmarks and recreational attractions. The Pittsburgh Summer 10K Litter Challenge ended on September 8th, but please continue to  join me in the looking out for litter with Litterati, and really seeing the litter around us–not just in our beloved natural sanctuaries, but also right in our own backyard where it can impact the lives of the birds, deer, and other animals we are fortunate enough to share our neighborhoods with.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/welcome/","Welcome byhumaneactionp|Jan 12, 2020 Welcome to the new Humane Action Pittsburgh (HAP) blog! It’s a new year, and we have set some great goals to develop humane laws for animals in the city, county, and state, with the hopes of rolling these policies out to the nation. To that end, this space will serve as a place to update all visitors to the website about actions that they can take to help us reach our goals, things they can do in their everyday lives to help end animal suffering, and provide resources for next steps as individuals want to become more involved in the work that HAP does. We want YOU to be involved, and there are many ways in which you can do that. The first step would be to come to a HAP meeting, which occur every six weeks. The next meeting is scheduled for 1/14 at the East Liberty Humane Animal Rescue organization. Come and introduce yourself, and decide at which level you would like to get involved. We have multiple campaigns, from No Plastic Please, to Compassionate Living, to Ending Puppy Mill misery. As you can imagine, these are campaigns that involve lofty goals and that is why we need your help! We need passionate people who want to get involved in a way that is comfortable and realistic for them. We are not a protest organization, but prefer to work with legislators and experts within the humane world to develop and implement policies and laws that help end the suffering of animals within our city, county, and state. Join us and share your talents in a way that is fulfilling and successful. Finally, we want our team to feel like they are part of the community. This blog will reflect that. If you are reading this and there is a subject you would like to see covered more in-depth within this space, please send a suggestion toinfo@humaneactionpittsburgh.org/If you have any questions about getting involved with HAP, what HAP is working on, or steps you can take to help our efforts, please feel free to email us!","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/victories/foie-gras-ban","Pittsburgh Takes a Stand Against Animal Cruelty: Historic Legislation Bans Foie Gras Products In a groundbreaking move in 2022, HAP presented a revolutionary idea to the Pittsburgh City Council—to become one of the pioneering cities in the country to outlaw cruel products derived from force-feeding animals, specifically targeting foie gras. Despite facing numerous obstacles, Councilperson Erika Strassburger and Councilman Bruce Kraus took the lead, resulting in the passage of this landmarklegislationon December 19th, 2023, with a decisive vote of 7 – 2. Why Foie Gras is Considered Cruel Producing foie gras involves force-feeding male ducks or geese excessive grain and fat through tubes up to three times daily. This cruel practice, known as “gavage,” leads to severe health issues for the birds, including engorged livers, difficulty standing, stress-induced feather-plucking, and various infections. The birds endure cramped conditions, unable to groom themselves, resulting in a layer of excrement and oil on their bodies. Female ducklings, deemed useless to the foie gras industry, face a gruesome fate—being thrown into grinders while still alive. Investigations into foie gras farms expose workers force-feeding hundreds of birds daily, causing injuries and suffering. Reports highlight severe health problems such as ruptured organs, maggot-infested wounds, and mortality rates up to 20 times higher than non-force-fed birds. Additionally, overcrowded sheds, rough handling, and inhumane conditions before and during force-feeding have been uncovered. Shockingly, about 15,000 ducks die annually before slaughter at a single farm, with some still moving after having their throats cut.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-rise-of-lab-grown-meat/","Worldwide, 70 billion land animals and trillions of marine animals are slaughtered each year to feed an unsustainable demand for meat that’s eating away at our planet. The vast majority of these animals are raised by the practice of factory farming where they experience abuse in extremely crowded and rancid conditions for the entirety of their short lives. However, a recent scientific advancement could not only mitigate animal slaughter, but also benefit the environment: lab-grown meat. What is Lab-Grown Meat? Lab-grown meat, as daunting as it may sound, could hold the key to fixing our broken food system. Instead of requiring the death of an animal for meat, the process of lab-grown meat starts with the careful extraction of a small number of muscle cells from an animal. From there, the cells are placed in a controlled environment where they can naturally replicate and mature, eventually resembling ground meat. Therefore, because it has the same animal cells traditionally considered as “meat”, lab-grown meat isn’t artificial and is—in fact—real meat. Once ready, standard conventions for packaging and shipping meat are used to deliver the meat to the consumers. Overall, this process can be likened to brewing beer; however, instead of growing yeast or bacteria, scientists grow animal cells.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-rise-of-lab-grown-meat/","https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Lab-meat-300x169.png","image",6
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-rise-of-lab-grown-meat/","A common question surrounding the idea of meat cultivated in a lab pertains to what it would be categorized as: is it considered vegetarian, nonvegetarian, or vegan? Although there is no clear-cut answer, it is important to remember that lab-grown meat contains cells taken from real, living animals, making it nonvegetarian. That being said, if the primary reason an individual chose to follow a vegan or vegetarian diet is due to animal slaughter, then perhaps cultivated meat would fit their lifestyle since it doesn’t involve putting the animals in any pain. The Benefits: Furthermore, meat cultivated in a lab offers a variety of advantages. As aforementioned, producing this meat inflicts minimal pain on animals, a far cry from the traditional exploitation, abuse, and slaughter of sentient animals. Rather, the animals would only experience slight pain momentarily, similar to what we feel when getting a routine blood test, during the extraction of its cells. Another benefit of lab-grown meat is that it’s much healthier for consumption. Because cultivated meat producers don’t use antibiotics, this meat addresses the growing concern of antibiotic resistance among humans. Essentially, this problem originates from factory farms administering high amounts of antibiotics to the animals to keep them alive in the grotesque conditions of the factory. However, this overuse of antibiotics also strengthens bacteria, rendering antibiotics ineffective. According to the WHO, at least 700,000 people die due to antibiotic-resistant infections annually—a number that is expected to increase to 10 million by 2050 if factory farming continues to be the norm. Consuming lab-grown meat would prevent this problem completely, making it a safer alternative.","text",7
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-rise-of-lab-grown-meat/","Along with the disuse of antibiotics, cultivated meat also doesn’t require synthetic growth hormones—another additive given to animals that have been the subject of debate over their potential negative impacts on human health, including their effects on puberty, and cancer. Thus, lab-grown meat doesn’t contain the harmful supplements found in traditional meat, but it does contain the same amount of protein. This meat can even be altered to contain less cholesterol and saturated fat in each cut while increasing the number of vitamins, minerals, and essential amino acids and fats.","text",8
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-rise-of-lab-grown-meat/","Another significant advantage of lab-grown meat is that it can slow climate change. Research has already proven that factory farming is an environmental danger, driving deforestation, pollution, global warming, and other planetary hazards. For instance, the production of one kilogram of beef requires 15,414 kg of water on average while nearly 80% of the world’s agricultural land is used to raise cattle.","text",9

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-rise-of-lab-grown-meat/","Lab-grown meat would eradicate the need for these resources allowing the large areas that were initially intended for livestock to be redeveloped for other purposes, such as carbon capture. Ultimately, lab-grown meat powered by renewable energy sources would result in a net positive for the planet. Today, we don’t know whether lab-grown meat will ever be able to replace traditional meat. Scientists are still working to perfect their products and provide nutritious meat at consumer-friendly prices. Thanks to the rise in innovations—such as UCLA’s new “microcarrier” which helps culture meat cells grow quicker and Good Meat’s plans to build the world’s largest bioreactor which could supply thousands of restaurants with beef and chicken—consumers around the meat may be able to incorporate lab-grown meat into their daily lives sooner rather than later. For now, here are a few startups to keep an eye on in the lab-grown meat industry: Still have lingering questions about lab-grown meat?

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/kangaroos-are-not-shoes-victory/","Kangaroos Are Not Shoes Victory byPaige Ottaviano|Apr 9, 2023 When most people in the United States think of the kangaroo, they think of an animal far away, roaming through the outback in peace, their only threat being the few natural predators they have. However, many people may not realize that they themselves may own leather made from the skin of kangaroos, notably soccer cleats, which are most commonly made from kangaroo skin. These everyday consumers likely have no idea that their purchases contributed to the largest commercial slaughter of mammals in the world. Nearly 2 million kangaroos are killed in Australia annually, along with roughly 400,000 joeys (baby kangaroos) for the use of kangaroo skin, or k-leather. Large sportswear companies such as Adidas use kangaroos to produce some models of soccer cleats. Currently, the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation does not allow for mass killing of wildlife in their native habitats for the sale of their parts in global commerce. While the United States holds this standard with other animal pelts, this is unfortunately currently not enforced with kangaroos.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/kangaroos-are-not-shoes-victory/","The slaughter of these animals is done quite inhumanely. Commercial hunters kill joeys of slain mother kangaroos by blunt force trauma to the head, typically by the force of their own boot. Additionally, a large percentage of kangaroos are “mis-shot”, flee with terrible injuries, and later die long and painful deaths. This commercial hunt is in no way regulated and is not supported by RSPCA and Australian animal welfare groups. AlternativesSynthetic materials are available and used effectively in other models of cleats. The availability of such comparable alternatives make the use of k-leather even more unnecessary and frustrating. Other large companies, such as Nike and Puma, have pledged to stop the use of kangaroo-leather in all their models by 2023 and 2025, respectively. Diadora has already completely stopped using k-leather in their products. These announcements come in part because of pressure put on companies from groups such as HAP in collaboration with Animal Wellness Action and The Center for a Humane Economy. These efforts make it very clear that the use of kangaroo skin can be avoided in the production of these sportswear products. Pressure is now largely on Adidas, the only remaining large sportswear company who has yet to make any similar commitments. Additionally, HAP has the goal to secure a commitment from Dick’s Sporting Goods to pledge never to use kangaroo skin in their products (they currently do not, but have not made a formal commitment) and consider not carrying kangaroo-leather cleats of other brands.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/kangaroos-are-not-shoes-victory/","Proposed Upcoming LegislationThe Kangaroo Protection Act would ban the importation of kangaroo products into the United States for commercial use with the intent to sell. While this bill has not been passed yet, there is hope that it can be in the near future. California has had a ban on k-leather since 1971, and states such as New Jersey, Vermont, Oregon, and Connecticut. are considering doing the same. Humane Action Pittsburgh is currently working to get Pennsylvania on this list as well! How to HelpWhile the killing of these animals may seem distant and out of reach for the average consumer to make a difference, there are several ways in which you can get involved in the efforts against kangaroo skin. First and foremost, check the materials of sportswear, specifically cleats, when you purchase them to make sure they are made of synthetic materials. That being said, be sure to educate your friends to do the same! The more people who are aware of the issue,  the more tractic the bill can get in the future. Additionally, keep an ear out for Action Alerts from HAP in the next few months regarding this bill. Lastly, you can give a monetary donation toHAPto support our organization’s efforts to get this bill passed. We will need all the help we can get in ensuring that kangaroo skin is no longer sold in Pennsylvania and the rest of the United States. Aimee Douglassis the Director of Compassionate Living.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-mistreatment-of-betta-fish/","Betta fish are known as an easy to care for “starter” fish, needing nothing more than a bowl to swim around in and their own company. Unfortunately, there is a plethora of misconceptions surrounding them, and this is much to the detriment of these beautiful creatures. In reality, fish are sentient beings, and studies have shown them to have remarkable skills such as the ability to use tools and recognize human faces. However, bettas are forced to live in cramped, artificial conditions where they don’t thrive, and, sadly enough, the cruelty begins long before their final destination. Betta fish suffer from the time they are born in the pet trade. Normally, they live in shallow, warm pools of water in Southeast Asia. On breeding farms, however, betta fish are kept in small bottles or bags with hardly enough water to cover their bodies. From there, the fish are shipped to their destinations around the world, often without food. Since this journey can take several days, it is common practice for tranquilizers to be added to their water so that they won’t eat their own tails. Given the brutal conditions on these trips, many of the bettas die in the process. The following video shows how betta fish make it to Petco: Once the betta fish reach pet stores, they are put into tiny, individual cups and stocked on the store shelves. It is not uncommon to find these fish dead or injured on the shelves, having never received  veterinary care. This unnecessary suffering wouldn’t be permitted with other pets, so why do we allow it with fish?","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-mistreatment-of-betta-fish/","Their lives do not usually tend to improve much once they have found homes, as pet store associates are taught that bettas must live in solitary confinement; in reality, only males fight with other males. Bettas require clean aquariums with gallons of well-heated water, a good filtration system, and enrichment such as caves and plants. Bettas kept as pets rarely get this kind of treatment. Some flower shops even sell bettas in a vase with a plant. These types of conditions aren’t conducive to allowing betta fish to live a happy, healthy life.​This August 1, on Respect for Fish Day, let’s vow to treat betta fish better. If you own or are thinking of buying a betta fish, do your research to give your fish the environment it needs to thrive. You can also educate your local pet store about the cruel betta fish pet trade and encourage the store to stop selling them. If you would like to join HAP’s Fish Feel campaign, please applyhere. Together, we can make the world a kinder place for fish.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-link-between-animal-abuse-and-domestic-violence/","The Link Between Animal Abuse and Domestic Violence byJennifer Thomas|Jan 19, 2022 “It wasn’t just the cats and the dogs I had, it was the sheep and the chickens – I was terrified for their welfare. I knew if I were to leave, he wouldn’t hesitate to kill them. He had done it before.”(1), said Susan Walsh as she discussed her experiences. Susan’s husband had retaliated against her and her children, preventing her from leaving an abusive relationship by threatening to harm her pets and farm animals. The story above is not an isolated incident. It’s a widespread epidemic with 71% of battered women reporting that their abusers had harmed, killed, or threatened animals as a way to control them(1). A growing body of research establishes the link between domestic violence and animal abuse. Animal cruelty is often an indicator of interpersonal violence such as child abuse, intimate partner violence, and elder abuse. Pet abuse is one of the four predictors of domestic partner violence with 85% of women and 63% of children who enter shelters in the United States reporting incidents of pet abuse(1).

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-link-between-animal-abuse-and-domestic-violence/","In the U.S., more than 10 million adults experience domestic violence annually(4). Abusers see the bond between their victims and their companion animals, and they exploit that bond to control, manipulate, and frighten their victims(2). Victims of domestic violence may delay leaving abusive situations, fearing their companion animals’ safety. The relationships between humans and animals in a household may yield strong indicators of the safety of the people in that household. Understanding that there is an inextricable link between domestic violence and animal abuse can open pathways for survivors to receive help. In no situation should a survivor have to choose between their own safety and the safety of their pets. What can we do to help? Education is one of the most important steps to protecting animals and humans. Community presentations, awareness events,humane education in schools, and training for professionals can build awareness and develop strategies for early intervention practices. To understand how animal abuse is incorporated into tactics used by perpetrators, refer to the “power and control wheel” below. A variety of resources exist to assist in developing your knowledge around this issue. Visit ourHumane Educationpage to request a class at your institution or organization.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-link-between-animal-abuse-and-domestic-violence/","TheNational Link Coalition, an organization dedicated to solving violence against animals and people, publishes a monthly newsletter to educate, share updates, and offer strategies for intervention on a local, state, or national level. Developing awareness of this link through community engagement can help to establish unlikely cross-disciplinary partnerships. In many communities, human and animal services, law enforcement, and other criminal justice experts, have begun sharing resources and expertise across sectors to address violence. Domestic violence shelters and other service providers should educate law enforcement and judges on the signs of domestic violence. They need to be equipped with resources for effective intervention prior to an incident occurring. By implementing a robust coordinated approach, responders who typically encounter domestic violence or animal abuse can help prevent other forms of violence. The National Link Coalition offers a wide range oftraining opportunitiesavailable for professionals in human services, animal care and control, law enforcement, criminal justice, veterinary medicine, and other fields. “Many survivors stay in an unsafe situation because they cannot take their animals with them to a shelter. 65% of women refuse or delay leaving an abusive home out of fear of leaving their pets or livestock behind.”(Phil Arkow, 2020) Sheltering Animals and Families Together[SAF-T] is educating and assisting domestic violence shelters to create on-site pet housing. SAF-T offers a variety of resources for individuals and families fleeing domestic violence, and guidelines to assist shelters in becoming low barrier and pet friendly.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-link-between-animal-abuse-and-domestic-violence/","“Animal cruelty does not occur in a vacuum, and the failure to fully examine its origins would likely lead to future criminal acts and the continued cycle of abuse and violence.” -Hon. H. Lee Chitwood, Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court, Pulaski, VA Animals are often chosen as soft targets because abusers believe that they can get away with it(1). Animal cruelty is a crime! All U.S. jurisdictions have prohibitions against animal maltreatment, and all 50 states declare some forms of animal abuse to be felonies. Because animal abuse often exposes other forms of violence in the household, police officers have a critical role to play. A police department review of national crime records found that 70% of people charged with cruelty to animals also had other reported incidents of violent behavior – including homicide(3).Reports of animal cruelty should be taken seriously. Early intervention can prevent others from harm.It is recommended that precincts invite officials from child protection, animal protection, adult protection, and domestic violence agencies to train their staff on how to recognize and report various forms of family violence. Read more about this link and its relation to law enforcementhere. Outside of police action, community members play an important role in protecting animals and people from abuse. Reporting suspected animal abuse can be complicated due to a lack of national or statewide systems. Use thisdirectoryto determine reportable agencies and be sure to provide as many specifics as possible in your report. If your area does not have a local response team, report animal cruelty to law enforcement immediately.

TheAnimal Legal Defense Fundprovides free legal assistance to those handling animal cruelty cases. They also work with state legislators to strengthen criminal animal protection laws. There are a variety oftoolkitsto give judges guidelines for investigating, prosecuting, and sentencing these types of crimes. The National Link Coalition offers an abundance of resources for judges deciding whether to dissolve a protection order, such as a bench card with a checklist of questions to assess risks, including animal abuse history. There are alsotoolkitsfor assessing and prosecuting animal abuse. This issue cannot simply be managed on a local level, though. With the link between animal abuse and domestic violence widely established, many states are working to toughen existing laws and create new ones. For instance, nearly two-thirds of states allow pets to be included on protection from abuse orders.Pennsylvaniais one of the few states that does not include this type of protection. It would be in our state’s best interest to implement this given the connection between animal abuse and domestic violence. ThePet and Women’s Safety Act [PAWS]is a federal law addressing the connection between domestic abuse and animal cruelty. This act provides protections for pets of domestic violence victims, and authorizes a grant program to allow shelters to accommodate pets. PAWS was introduced to respond to this crisis by helping programs provide shelter and housing assistance for the companion animals of domestic violence victims. These are just a few examples of how legislation is a critical piece of this puzzle.","text",13

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/take-action/state-and-federal-initiatives/ban-live-pigeon-shoots/","Ban Live Pigeon Shoots Overview Live pigeon shoots are inhumane contests where live birds who have been captured, brought into Pennsylvania—often illegally from neighboring states—are shot at close range by shooters who earn points for every bird they shoot down within a certain range. Observers estimate that 70% of the birds are wounded but not killed outright. Banned under the cruelty laws in most states, Pennsylvania is one of the last states that legally and openly holds live pigeon shoots","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/take-action/state-and-federal-initiatives/ban-live-pigeon-shoots/","Problem An extremely cruel event, each live pigeon shoot results in unimaginable suffering. In preparation for the shoot, pigeons are kept in boxes and then launched one-by-one into the air by a spring loaded bottom. The birds are disoriented and confused as the shooter opens fire. Neighboring property owners around the shoots have watched wounded birds slowly bleed to death over hours — and even days. The Facts CHILD CORRUPTION After each round, birds within the shooting circle are collected – often by youth – and killed by slamming, snapping, or snipping the heads off or breaking their necks. GAMBLING ON AGONY Similar to dog fights, participants gamble on the outcome of these events. The “winners” receive prizes for killing. WANTON KILLING True sportsmen abhor these shoots — they understand there is nothing sporting about close-range shooting of mechanically-launched, dehydrated, and disoriented birds. OVERWHELMING SUPPORT OF BAN In addition to nearly every major and minor newspaper in the state, HAP supports a ban on live pigeon shoots along with The Humane Society of the United States, Pennsylvania Veterinary Medical Association, ASPCA, The Pennsylvania Bar Association, Pennsylvania Council of Churches, Pennsylvania Federation of Humane Societies, Humane Society of Berks County (where most shoots are held) as well as most shelters, humane societies, and animal organizations in the state. What is HAP doing about it? Working in conjunction with Humane PA and other organizations, HAP is advocating for the passage of HB1475, a bill to enact a statewide ban on live pigeon shoots. HAP worked with Pittsburgh City Council to pass a Wild Bird ordinance in 2020 that prohibits trapping, harming, and selling of pigeons. This rectifies language in a previous city ordinance that was unclear and unenforceable. Working in conjunction with Humane PA and other animal organizations, HAP strongly encourages the PA House and Senate to enact a statewide ban on live pigeon shoots.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/take-action/state-and-federal-initiatives/ban-live-pigeon-shoots/","We believe the majority of legislators will support the ban if brought to a vote. In fact, HAP has procured proclamations, writs of council, and letters written by elected officials in support of a statewide ban.","text",6
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/take-action/state-and-federal-initiatives/ban-live-pigeon-shoots/","We also urge the Pennsylvania Game Commission to ban live pigeon shoots statewide. Notably, the PA Game Commission has opined that a narrowly tailored ban on live pigeon shoots, as provided for in this legislation, will not affect any legal hunting activities in Pennsylvania. Whether passed as a legislative or regulatory ban, the PA Game Commission needs to acknowledge they have the authority to prevent extreme cruelty and that they answer to all Pennsylvanians, not just the pigeon shooting minority. How You Can Help Email or call your State Senator and State Representative asking for their support of bill HB1475 to ban live pigeon shoots. Find your legislatorshere. Email to the PA Game Commissioner, kindly reminding them they have the authority to ban live pigeon shoots and should do so immediately.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-detrimental-disappearance-of-the-colorado-river/","The Detrimental Disappearance of the Colorado River byAbhi Nadendla|May 22, 2024 Nestled within the rugged terrain of the American Southwest and the Grand Canyon, the Colorado River weaves through a tapestry of breathtaking landscapes, providing an oasis for life amid the stark beauty of the desert. This 1,450-mile-long stream of water spans seven states and two nations—sustaining major cities, intricate ecosystems, and Native American tribes alike. However, tales of the timeless flow of water within the river may remain in the past as the effects of overconsumption and climate change progressively drain this critical artery, leaving behind deadly consequences for all that depend on it. Overconsumption Given the vast extent of the river and its passage through numerous territories, a series of agreements from 1922 to 1964 were established to allocate the annual flow of 16.5 million acre-feet of the Colorado River among seven states and Mexico. The chart below depicts a summary of the compromises:","text",3
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-detrimental-disappearance-of-the-colorado-river/","https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crb1-300x163.png","image",4
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-detrimental-disappearance-of-the-colorado-river/","While many would expect the issue of overconsumption to stem from the rapid population growth and high water consumption of major cities such as Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Las Vegas, the reality is that the majority of the water from the Colorado River — more than one trillion gallons – is used to grow feed for livestock, namely alfalfa. In the Upper Basin, approximately 90% of all water utilized for agricultural purposes is consumed by alfalfa and other cattle-feed crops. This constitutes nearly half of the total water usage by the states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming, and for environmental purposes combined. Consequently, the water consumption of alfalfa surpasses that of cities, commercial entities, and industries across the entire basin, accounting for a collective usage of approximately 3.5 million acre-feet, which equates to 18% of the river’s water. Thus, excessive alfalfa and livestock feed cultivation is literally draining the Colorado River. While these crops offer drought resistance, high market demand, and efficient mechanized harvesting, they come at the cost of depleting a lifeline for over 40 million individuals and five million acres of cropland. Moreover, the fact that alfalfa primarily serves to feed the same cattle destined for dinner plates exacerbates the issue. By some estimates, producing a quarter-pound beef patty could require over 38 gallons of water, which encompasses the water needed to cultivate all the feed, such as alfalfa and hay, consumed by the cattle. Considering an American who eats three hamburgers a week, resulting in an annual national total of 50 million burgers, this calculation grows to astronomical proportions. In contrast, obtaining the equivalent amount of protein from tofu typically necessitates approximately five gallons of water.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-detrimental-disappearance-of-the-colorado-river/","https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crb2-176x300.png","image",6
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-detrimental-disappearance-of-the-colorado-river/","The figure to the left also effectively breaks down the consumption of the Colorado River. As evident, crops intended for direct human consumption, such as vegetables, utilize less than a quarter of the water consumed by livestock feed. Similarly, residential water consumption, including activities like lawn irrigation and showering, accounts for only a fifth of the water used by livestock feed. Climate change From 2000 to 2021, the impact of climate change resulted in the depletion of approximately 10 trillion gallons of water in the Colorado River Basin, roughly equivalent to the total storage capacity of Lake Mead, one of the two major reservoirs of the river. Since 1880, there has been a warming trend of 1.5°C (2.7 F), aligning with the onset of the fossil fuel era. With every 1°C (1.8 F) increase in temperature in the Upper Basin, the basin experiences a loss of 4% to 10% of its water supply. This warming trend not only leads to increased water evaporation but also affects vegetation, consequently impacting snowpack runoff into the basin’s rivers by 10.3%. Areas that were historically covered in snow during winter are now experiencing water loss at a rate twice as fast as regions that were typically snow-free. However, this evaporation can’t be attributed to a temporary cause such as a dry spell; instead, all evidence suggests that the rapid water loss is an indicator of long-term aridification — a phenomenon characterized by a gradual and sustained drying of an area over decades to centuries. Therefore, it’s improbable that precipitation and water levels will return to normal in this region anytime soon. Taking Action At the end of the day, the draining of the Colorado River boils down to one question: what can we do to return this lifeline to its former glory?","text",7
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-detrimental-disappearance-of-the-colorado-river/","While common water-saving strategies such as having fewer lawns, avoiding long showers, and being conscious of our water usage will have an impact, changing dietary habits will allow for the most visible, efficient results. Adopting a vegan diet would mitigate overconsumption by eliminating the need for cattle and, consequently, the cultivation of water-intensive crops like alfalfa. Additionally, reducing methane emissions associated with cattle would curb climate change—a dual approach to tackling the river’s main challenges.","text",8

Maybe we will eat something tomorrow. However, do not wait for tomorrow. Breakfast is actually backed by science and here is why. Eating breakfast jumpstarts your metabolism and helps you burn calories throughout the day. By skipping breakfast you are sending a message to your body that food is scarce and we need to hold onto those extra calories. Eating breakfast also helps you meet your fruit and veggie goals for the day and increases better performance at work and school. Want to make a quick breakfast that will fuel you on the go? Try making my homemade granola. Your tummy will say thank you. Homemade granola is truly a chance to show your creativity in the kitchen. You can add anything you want, but more importantly, it can really change the flavor with the seasons.","text",3

I found this recipe on Instagram, tweaked it a little to my liking, and it quickly became a recipe I often make. Most ingredients are probably already in your cupboard, but if not, Trader Joe’s is where I go to pick up more specialty ingredients. I love their extra firm tofu. It holds together really well and it’s not watery like some other brands. My tofu-skeptical friends even like this recipe! It’s a winner for me and I hope it’s a winner for you and your friends, too. Enjoy!","text",7

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/hap-hive-landing","HAP Hive HAP Hive is a pollinator protection initiative created by Humane Action Pittsburgh. Our goal is to educate citizens, create homes for bees, butterflies, birds and other pollinators, and encourage others to foster a safe environment for them. Pollinators are crucial to life on Earth because they allow plants to reproduce through pollination. If there are no pollinators, then we lose certain flowers, plants, and foods. Without them, our ecosystem is in trouble. HAP’s three core actions to save pollinators are: It is imperative to limit or cease the use of business and home chemical pesticides. Instead, choose natural deterrents, such as a mixture of soap, peppermint oil, and water. Call or email your local officials to encourage them to stop the use of pesticides on public lands. Our goal is to see the City of Pittsburgh eliminate its use of chemical pesticides. You can help bees in your own backyard. Flowers are a bee’s food source, so building a garden for bees with no chemical pesticides will provide a pollination sanctuary and continual meals for your neighborhood bees. You can even contact your local office and inquire about building a neighborhood pollinator garden. Bee hotels are a small structure that provides a place for solitary bees to shelter and rest. Our goal is to produce and install bee hotels to encourage settlement and increase the bee population throughout Western PA where natural habitats have been destroyed.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/hap-hive-landing","These hotels are made from organic materials and can be easily made at home. The key items you need are a cylindrical container, hollow reeds, and some twine. You’ll want to cut the reeds to match the length of the container and fill the container with as many reeds as you can. The twine can be attached to the container and hung. Hang it in a sunny location that won’t receive heavy rain. For more information and a video tutorial, visithere. Imagine for a moment… Imagine for a moment that you are walking on a path through a garden on a spring morning. On both sides of the path, colorful flowers are raising their heads to drink in the sunlight. That picture seems peaceful, but in reality, this garden is bustling and noisy. Bees are zipping between flowers and birds are singing excitedly in the tree canopy nearby. Caterpillars are moving to life on the leaves and the massive network of roots under your feet are awake and doling out nutrients. The gears that make this garden tick, the pollinators, are filling it with life and hard work.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/hap-hive-landing","It’s hardly a secret that pollinators are important to ecosystems, but why? Over 80% of the world’s flowering plants require a pollinator to reproduce, and approximately one out of every three bites of our food is created with their friendly help. Their ecological contributions, including healthier soil and cleaner water, are worth billions of dollars. But the pollinators of our world are facing increasing challenges, from habitat loss to pesticides. Manicured lawns are green spaces that aren’t really “green”—most of these lawns are not pollinator-friendly and do not support our vital insect infrastructure. Thankfully, you can make a difference by giving your yard a makeover, and transforming your lawn into a beautiful pollinator haven is not as difficult as it sounds.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/contacting-legislators/","The United States of America is the world’s oldest democracy, founded on the principle that citizens should have a say in how they are governed. While not a true democracy, we do have a representative democracy, where we elect officials to represent our interests. This post is not meant to be political in any way, so no matter your beliefs or your affiliation, it is always a good idea to contact your legislators on matters that are of importance to you. Every HAP meeting ends with a Call to Action whereby members can call or email their representatives or senators to consider a position on a certain bill, to co-sponsor a bill, or even urge them to move a specific bill out of the committee stage for a full vote. Actions are also included in the newsletters that HAP sends out. Unlike petitions that make the rounds of social media, contacting your legislators has an impact. Calling Legislators “Several lawmakers, along with those who work for them, said in interviews that Ms. Waite is right: A phone call from a constituent can, indeed, hold more weight than an email, and far outweighs a Facebook post or a tweet.” Victor, 2016 While one call from one individual may not have an impact, outreach efforts from multiple people can make a difference. When calling, you will reach an intern or lower level staffer. However, do not be convinced that this contact is not crucial, because it is. As a common practice, calls are logged by staffers and then presented on a regular basis, usually weekly, to the representative or senator. Sure two calls may not be a blip on the radar, but 10, 20, 30 or 40 people calling about the same issue, that will get someone’s attention. Based on the numbers, staff members can use a methodology to extrapolate those numbers across the larger population within the legislator’s district, and can lead to action. Never underestimate the power of your voice!","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/contacting-legislators/","Emailing Legislators While calling does seem to have a greater effect than emailing, that does not mean the act has no value. Emailing allows one to provide more information, although it is not a time to write a novel. It also allows for a more “human” approach. While most of the time emails are also handled by a staffer and not actually the legislator, that communication is logged as well, and can contribute to developing a quorum on an issue that might help to sway a legislator, especially one who may be on the fence about a particular issue. Thelinkprovides tips for writing an effective and compelling email. Please do not ever believe that calling or emailing does not work – it does! Groups like HAP and others across the country have proven that on a daily basis and worked to effect policy decisions on both the local and national level.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/respect-our-home/","It’s true. I’m a nature lover. A tree hugger if you will. I love it all: hiking, biking, camping. Experiencing the outdoors has been a part of my life since childhood and has had a hand in shaping me into the person I am today. The awe and wonder I felt as I walked over the soft bedding of pine needles was unrivaled. I can clearly recall the curiosity that filled me when I gently ran my fingers along a fern and it closed its leaves to protect itself and the excitement that had me endlessly searching for my favorite species of newt, the red eft. It was amazing and thrilling and I wanted my kids to experience it all. Once we began our outdoor adventures, obviously I wanted them to enjoy nature but I also wanted them to respect it. And so I taught them to “let nature be.” That was the phrase I repeated over and over until they came to understand the importance of being kind to their world and everything in it. Even as adults we need to be aware of how our presence impacts nature and what we can do to reduce any negative effect we have on the great outdoors. So let’s talk numbers. In 2020 and 2021, over 50 million Americans went camping and there are roughly 57.8 million hikers in the U.S. That’s not a small number by any means and this level of encroachment on nature will only cause harm unless done with care and consideration. One of the biggest ways to show your love of nature is to adhere to the popular adage, leave no trace. Leaving no trace refers to leaving nature exactly how you found it. A number of easy ways to do this includes: One of the biggest ways to leave no trace is to stay on the trail and to not take things like shells, wildflowers, rocks, plants, pinecones or any natural elements while you’re there. It sounds simple enough until you see a beautiful wildflower or unique rock just off the beaten path, but try to resist the urge to head off trail and remove these types of things from their natural setting.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/respect-our-home/","Doing so could cause significant damage to the ecosystem in a number of ways including extreme erosion and loss of habitat. Of course if you want to “take” a picture, go for it! If it becomes necessary to go off trail or if you just can’t resist, it’s always best to stay on durable surfaces like rock, sand, gravel and dry grasses and to avoid fragile surfaces like vegetation and soft areas near a water source.","text",6
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/respect-our-home/","Another crucial way to help preserve nature is to protect its water sources. Water is our most used natural resource, so it stands to reason that it is worth protecting. In order to preserve water sources use your own water to wash dirty camping dishes and make sure that you are far from streams and other shared water sources while washing, do not use soap in any water sources, and if there is no restroom use the following protocol: go to the bathroom at least 200 ft from the water source, dig a hole, and then cover the hole. “Only you can prevent forest fires.” We’ve all heard the famous catch phrase of Smokey the Bear and he knows what he’s talking about! One of the highlights for many campers is sitting around the campfire with family and friends making s’mores but don’t forget to be safe! Here are some easy ways to take Smokey the Bear’s words to heart.","text",7

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/respect-our-home/","And of course we need to respect all wildlife. When out in nature, it’s imperative to never touch or feed wildlife. Doing so is unhealthy for the animals and could lead to negative interactions with humans. It is also important when camping to use an established campsite in order to separate yourself from wildlife and to reduce damage to habitat. Preparation is also key. Research information such as what wildlife lives in the area and if bear-proof food is storage necessary. Other things to consider are keeping dogs under control and preventing them from chasing wildlife and storing food and trash safely to prevent interactions with wildlife. Using odor proof bags, refraining from burying trash, and utilizing reusable drink bottles and food containers go a long way when reducing trash and keeping wildlife away from any food.","text",9

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/respect-our-home/","Trash is dangerous for wildlife in any location whether it be in the country or the city. That’s why HAP has introduced the Pittsburgh Ploggers initiative. “Plogging” is the practice of picking up litter while joggingor walking outside. HAP has been partnering with student groups around the city to help clean up litter and working with the Clean Pittsburgh Commission to bring the Litterati app to our city in an effort to gather data on litter collected while plogging. The hope is that this data will help support policy decisions that will decrease the amount of litter that ends up in the local environment. Start your plogging journey by downloading the app from the Apple or Google Play store or consider donating to HAP so that we can continue to promote this wonderful initiative. Enjoying and respecting nature go hand in hand. We have to take it upon ourselves to keep our world clean and beautiful and healthy or there won’t be much left in the future to enjoy. So remember, when you’re having fun hiking or camping or whatever you love the most…leave nature be. Aimee Douglassis the Director of Compassionate Living.

The practices lurk just beyond tourists’ view and aren’t a common part of public knowledge. Responsible for catching 93 million tons of wild fish and cultivating 48 million tons of farmed fish annually (according toWorld Atlas), the commercial fishing industry is taking a terrible toll on the environment.

Coral reefs are ripped from the ocean floor. The resulting sand and debris excavated in the process leads to further damage, blocking sunlight from reaching underwater plants.","text",7

These two types of fishing also destroy the environments in which the explosives or cyanide are released, causing even more destruction in their wake. Bycatch—where marine species who are not the intended victims of the commercial fishing industry are scooped up into huge fishing nets accidentally, and injured or killed in the process—is another issue. Global bycatch may amount to 40% of the world’s catch, totalling 63 billion pounds per year, according toOceana’s report. Credit: Photo byBrian Raymond","text",9

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/what-lies-beneath-a-look-at-the-destruction-caused-by-the-commercial-fishing-industry/","Aqua farming also creeps behind the scenes, where many fish are confined in small spaces for one reason—to be raised for food. As reported byAnimal Equality, these fish can spend their whole lives (up to two years) in captivity. As one can imagine, this leads to dirty conditions for the captured fish. Because aqua farms are either cordoned-off sections of the ocean with nets serving as containment or boxes on land without access to fresh water, the entire unit becomes a cesspool. Imagine swimming around in your own feces and other waste with no outlet or way to flush the toilet. It’s not only waste these fish are forced to live in — the water also contains antibiotics and pesticides. These are common ways aqua farmers seek to reduce the number of (unsurprisingly) diseased fish who survive the traumatic ordeal until it’s dinner time. Aqua farms spread these conditions further into the ocean and its wild fish, as well as tohumans who consume any fish living in or around these circumstances. And it isn’t any better for fish populations,as it takes five pounds of ocean fish to produce just one pound of farmed salmon. Credit: Photo fromanimalEQUALITY","text",11

The debris and gear left behind after the expedition is, too. Buoys, lines, and nets account for more than two-thirds of large plastic debris found in oceans based onthis study, which sought to put numbers to the vast amount of plastic pollution of the world’s oceans.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/what-lies-beneath-a-look-at-the-destruction-caused-by-the-commercial-fishing-industry/","All of the above practices have led to overfishing, where, asWorld Atlasputs it, “fish populations are reduced to below dangerously low levels, resulting in reduced growth, resource depletion, and sometimes unsustainable population sizes.” WithWorld Wildlifereporting that the number of overfished stocks globally has tripled over 50 years, something has to be done to protect our scaly friends, or the view from the shore may become much starker. After all, how great could an ocean be without the marine inhabitants who call it home? Now that you have some insight on the destruction of the commercial fishing industry on the world’s oceans, it’s time to consider how to go about reversing the damage. There are choices we can make individually and collectively to stop the missile of annihilation aimed at marine life in our oceans. Ways to Help Aimee Douglassis the Director of Compassionate Living.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/kentucky-derby-alternatives-to-the-cruelty/","Kentucky Derby: Alternatives to the Cruelty byHannah Lewis|May 18, 2022 In today’s world of perpetual social media, events that are visually stunning have caught on, and I’ve noticed a bit of a renaissance of the Kentucky Derby Party. People get together in eccentric fancy dress with ornate hats and colorful cocktails to watch horse races and gamble. On its surface, it may seem like a harmless way to make fun memories that will delight you when you flip back through your Instagram Stories to see bright dresses and suits and feathered hats. But the Kentucky Derby remains a monument to a history of cruelty in this country. We were painfully reminded of its cruel legacy this year when, at three years old, Medina Spirit, the 2021 Derby winning horse,collapsed and diedfrom a heart attack after a practice. Medina Spirit’s Derby victory was marred by controversy because hetested positive for drugsthat are prohibited on race day. And this is not an isolated incident. In 2020,more than two dozentrainers, veterinarians, and drug distributors were indicted for participating in doping rings. And in 2018, a lethal year for horses in the U.S., nearly500 Thoroughbred racehorses died.","text",3

The jockeys and the racegoers who enjoy these Derby watch parties likely see themselves as horse lovers, too. But the truth is that horseracing is not only cruel, but absolutely lethal to these beloved animals. Horseracing has become highly competitive, with horses frequently racing year-round without enough recovery time between races. And the practice of drugging horses makes racing even more dangerous. Despite attempts to crack down on doping horses, the practice often continues. As a result of the tremendous pressure to perform at the highest level, these horses suffer broken limbs (which are fatal to horses in almost all cases) in addition to exhaustion. You just can’t push an animal beyond their limits without injury or death–but in the interest of winning not just the Kentucky Derby but the triple crown, many continue to exhaust their animals, just in order to win.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/kentucky-derby-alternatives-to-the-cruelty/","“Kentucky Derby Style” bySteve Corey Attire:What makes a Kentucky Derby the most iconic isn’t even the horseracing–it’s the dress code. People often wear bright, colorful dresses or sports jackets paired with an ornate hat, usually with feathers. Keep the cool colors, but lose the feathers. These feathers are actually another monument to immense cruelty and destruction in this country–the feather trade. So unforgiving were feather hunters, so absolute in their destruction, that they drove numerous birds to the brink of extinction. You can learn more about one bird hunter turned conservationist,Guy Bradley, whose efforts to prohibit the hunting of birds for feathers ended with his death. Feather fashion gets less attention than fur, but it, too, is a reminder of cruelty in the name of fashion. It’s a testament to the total destruction we wrought on birds here in North America–so opt forcruelty-free fashioninstead.","text",9

Gambling:Instead of using your money to bet on race horses being pitted against each other in a feat of exhaustion they have no say in, consider making donations to organizations likeHumane Action Pittsburghor other animal protection groups. If you want the fun of gambling, you can organize a 50/50 or a poker game with prize money, but with part of the proceeds going to a pro-animal charity.

I’m met with a thousand questions: “how do you get one?” “how much did he cost?” and, most importantly, “how much money did he win?” They’re missing the point. First and foremost, I never say I rescued a horse from the racetrack. That’s not true. He was bought from the track. Actually, I got him from someone that originally got him from the track. She took great care of him. I can’t emphasize enough that he was anything but a rescue situation. The majority of former racehorses aren’t considered rescues.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/defying-the-odds-from-brokendown-racehorse-to-lifelong-companion/","I bought Secret Service I when I was 16, but had many horses before that. They were all old, safe, and reliable. Above everything else, they were healthy. I felt ready for something tougher. Like any sport, you move up. It’s just in this sport your key to success has its own brain, body, and soul. Horses are alsoprey animals, meaning they’re hunted by mountain lions, coyotes, wolves, and humans. From my perspective, this means an animal will do anything to survive. It’ll hide pain to the point that it can no longer move. I’ve seen this firsthand. It’s awell known secretthat the horse racing industry is dirty. However, there have been some strides to make it better. Due to public scrutiny, theHorse Racing Integrity and Safety Act has just recently been enacted. But things still weren’t really improving in the industry when Secret came into my life. I will give the racing industry one benefit of the doubt. They do try to repurpose some of these horses when they’re deemed “not good enough.” Notably, they’re dirt cheap. What most fail to realize is there’s a reason they’re not winning. More often than not, they’re in incredible pain. Secret always stood a little funny our first year of having him. His head would be down, and his legs would sprawl out. I didn’t think much of it. I honestly brushed it off to his aloof personality. Horses are normallypretty interactiveand experience a lot of emotions, ranging from excitement, fear, to even jealousy. Not Secret. He didn’t really want to be brushed or doted over. He preferred his space. I respected that. Those should have been my first clues that something was really, really wrong. He started to lose weight pretty rapidly. I was feeding him a lot and consulted my vet to get him on a nutritious diet. Nothing was working.Horses eat a lot to begin with. As time went on, things got even worse. It got to the point that he was at least 200 pounds underweight nor could he even bear weight on his back.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/defying-the-odds-from-brokendown-racehorse-to-lifelong-companion/","One time, his pain was so intense, he thrashed, reared, and eventually collapsed in his stall. At only 6 years old, the end was very near for Secret.","text",6

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/defying-the-odds-from-brokendown-racehorse-to-lifelong-companion/","We had to keep a note from the vet saying that he was under care. Otherwise, we were afraid an innocent onlooker would report us for animal neglect if they saw the state of him in our pasture. I had a very difficult decision to make as a very young teenager. Do I investigate more answers (mind you, this cost a lot of money)? Do we prepare to humanely euthanize him in his best interest? Or do we see if he just heals on his own? We weren’t prepared to euthanize him and the bills had already piled up enough, so we just left him alone hoping that might be the answer. Over a couple of months, his condition deteriorated even further. He lost so much muscle mass, he couldn’t retract his penis any more, and eating was just excruciating for him. Long story short, we found a solution through a chiropractor. Secret, due to an incident at the track, dislocated his wholesacrum. It’s an incredibly rare and painful injury. It’s life-ending if not resolved. Secret went on to have a very successful career with me. He has one won multiple awards and titles.","text",8

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/defying-the-odds-from-brokendown-racehorse-to-lifelong-companion/","Again, that’s not the point. I have had him for almost 10 years and still ride him regularly, but not without constant maintenance and upkeep. His sacrum, to this day, requires chiropractic adjustments, special massages, and leg stretches. Sometimes he even gets acupuncture. Horses are startedreally young on the track. This means when an injury occurs, it is lifelong. It is not “cool” to own a former racehorse. It’s expensive, time consuming, and requires a lot of dedication. There are more options now than ever to own one as rehabbing and retraining programs are part of the track industry’s way to makeamends.New Vocationsis the largest racehorse rehabilitation and retraining program in the country and allows future owners to access all veterinary records before adoption. They also partner with ASPCA. If you want to adopt a racehorse, do it the right way–unlike me. Be prepared. But most importantly, give the horse love because he probably never experienced it before.","text",10

Most cows aren’t so lucky. At factory farms, cows frequently suffer cruel and inhumane treatment practices. Photo byOriol PascualonUnsplash","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-dairy-industry-a-shocking-look-behind-the-scenes/","Investigation Uncovers Barbaric Practices at Factory Farms As part of my research for this blog post, I watchedAnimal Outlook’s expose, Dairy is Dead on Arrival. An investigator spent two years working undercover inside several factory farms. The horrors she witnessed and documented on video are beyond disturbing. Some of the barbaric practices include: Erica Meier, president of Animal Outlook, says “Some farms might be less cruel than others, but there is no such thing as cruelty-free milk.” Dairy Farming — A Hotbed of Animal Abuse In addition to the atrocities in the documentary, there are common abusive practices prevalent throughout the industry. Because cows only produce milk while pregnant or nursing, they are repeatedly impregnated by artificial insemination. It starts not long after their first birthday.Farmers force the female cows into a narrow trap, known as a “cattle crush,” where they are brutally impregnated. After giving birth, cows lactate for 10 months. None of the mother’s milk, however, will go to feed her calf. Instead, the newborn will typically be callously separated from the mother within a day. According to wildlife experts, a strong bond occurs between a cow and her calf at birth. Grieving mothers often bellow and cry out for days after separation from their babies. Where do those calves go? Females end up in the same traumatic cycle as their mothers. The males are sold to be raised as veal (its own hell)or slaughtered.When lactation ends, the cows are impregnated again and again, perpetuating the cycle. Photo bycottonbrofromPexels","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-dairy-industry-a-shocking-look-behind-the-scenes/","Squalid Conditions and Sickness In addition to repeatedly impregnating cows and stealing their babies, farms confine female calves to individual pens, often forcing them to spend their lives standing on concrete floors.Others are subjected to massive and crowded lots where they live amid their own feces. To produce more milk, the cows are pumped full of antibiotics and hormones.Painful inflammation of the mammary glands, or mastitis, is common among cows raised for their milk. Udder infections are one of dairy farms’ most frequent reasons for sending cows to slaughter. Though their natural lifespan is two decades, most cows are sent off to slaughter after four or five years when their milk production wanes. Stressful conditions on factory farms cut their milk production years by half. Disease, lameness and reproductive issues render them worthless before their time.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-dairy-industry-a-shocking-look-behind-the-scenes/","Dairy Farming’s Impact on the Environment The environment also suffers as a result of unsustainable dairy farming practices. Cows and manure release methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These toxic greenhouse gases contribute to climate change, an issue that now seems undeniable as the world experiences extreme weather, wildfires, and melting glaciers. In addition, farms that poorly handle manure and fertilizers can degrade local water resources, poisoning endless miles of groundwater, rivers, and streams. Unsustainable dairy farming can also lead to the loss of ecologically important areas that include wetlands, prairies, and forests. Photo byAmber KipponUnsplash","text",9

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-dairy-industry-a-shocking-look-behind-the-scenes/","What We Can Do to Help The best way to save cows from misery and abuse, as well as help support the environment, is to stop buying cow’s milk and other dairy products. When you think about it, cow’s milk is intended for calves, not humans. In fact, humans are the ONLY animals on the planet that drink milk from a different species. Before you start mourning your milk and cookies and pizza, there are plenty of tasty vegan options to choose from these days. Here’s alist of 17 dairy-free milksto try, such as almond, coconut, soy and cashew milk, to name a few. In addition, many grocery stores carry plant-based alternatives for staples like butter, yogurt, ice cream, and cheese. Concerned about how ditching milk will impact your calcium consumption and bone health? You’ll find plenty of nutrient-rich,plant-based sources of calcium. And if you haven’t heard, somestudies suggestthat greater intake of milk and dairy products is NOT associated with a lower risk of osteoporosis. It’s time to put our money where our mouth is. When we speak with our wallets, we force the dairy industry to listen. Aimee Douglassis the Director of Compassionate Living.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/regional-initiatives/freedom-for-fish/the-fishing-industry/","The Fishing Industry The commercial fishing industry and aqua farming are responsible for the suffering and deaths oftrillionsof fish worldwide. Experts predict if we don’t change our habits soon, our oceanswill be fishlessby 2048 Problem These industries have devastating effects on the world’s fish population and the environment. The commercial fishing industry uses practices such as bottom trawling (where fishing boats drag huge nets across the floor of the ocean, scaring up fish and many other unintended victims and ecosystems from the depths) and longline fishing (where long fishing lines studded with multiple hooks are floated through the water to catch fish, but yet again catch more than they bargained for, including sea birds, turtles, and even whales). Aqua farming is the other insidious side of the coin, where fish are confined together in small spaces. This practice leads to toxic water conditions for the fish in captivity that spread into the ocean—carrying antibiotics, pesticides, parasites, and feces. These dirty conditions are spread into the ocean, negatively affecting wild fish and oceans, as well as spreading to humans who consume any fish living in or around these circumstances. Aqua farming also closely coincides with the commercial fishing industry because the fish in captivity are fed smaller fish, leading to even more overfishing, a never ending cycle of death.","text",3

According toAnimal Equality, if the fishing industry continues their path of destruction on wild and farmed fish, our oceans will be void of fish by 2048. The fishing techniques used in the industry not only catch and kill fish for food and sport, but also lead to unplanned injuries and death of other wildlife species and ecosystems in the ocean, dragging up dirt that damages coral reefs and blocks sunlight from reaching underwater plants. The United Nations has estimated that 95% of global ocean damage is a direct result of bottom trawling. Many wildlife species are also killed as “bycatch,” where they are scooped up into the huge nets intended for fish, and injured or killed in the process.","text",10

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/regional-initiatives/freedom-for-fish/the-fishing-industry/","What Is HAP Doing About It? Education and awareness about these issues are our first aim at HAP. Knowing how destructive the commercial fishing industry and aqua farms are to the lives of fish, other species, and ultimately, humans can be the push people need to reform and end the fishing industry’s practices. Our first step is to educate the public of the inhumane treatment fish encounter when caught from the wild to be imprisoned in tiny tanks as pets or killed for food. Awareness is key while fighting for the lives of fish, who are capable of remembering past social interactions with other fish and show affection by rubbing up against one another. Through our“Better for Betta Fish”campaign, we’re working with pet stores to stop the sale of betta fish as pets, leaving them in their natural habitat to thrive. Our“No Plastic Please”campaign also benefits humans and fish (and other animals!) by reducing unnecessary single-use plastic waste.  We hope to reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in oceans, eliminating risk to ALL species and keeping plastic from littering our communities and waterways. How You Can Help Choosing to eat a plant-based diet so as not to contribute to the suffering of all marine life is the main way to decrease the negative impact of the fishing industry on wild fish. Change starts with you! If there isn’t a demand for fish as food or ornamental decoration, the supply and terrible practices will decrease. Please help us in taking a stand against the fishing industry and senseless lives lost. Learning about the horrors of the fishing industry and educating others about it can help.Help to educate pet stores where you see injured, sick, or abused fish if you feel comfortable doing so. Yourdonationcan also help us save fish from suffering or early death by funding us to educate and inspire the next generation on this important issue.","text",12

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/puppy-mill-ban.html","Puppy Mill Ban In December 2015, Humane Action Pittsburgh successfully drafted and worked for the passage of two ordinances to protect mill-bred animals. The first is aretail sales banof dogs, cats, and rabbits not from a shelter or rescue in Pittsburgh, the first ordinance of its kind in the state of Pennsylvania. The Ordinance makes it illegal to sell commercially bred dogs, cats, and rabbits within city limits. Secondly, the companion ordinance requires any licensed breeders and kennels to disclose their kennel license and sales license in all advertisements. Since passing these laws in Pittsburgh, HAP has worked with the boroughs of Sharpsburg, Bellevue, Monessen, and Wilkinsburg to pass similar legislation. Our aim is to enact more similar laws all throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. If you are interested in working on legislation to combat puppy mills in your community, pleasereach out!

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/chimney-swifts/","Chimney Swifts Conflict Solutions Most of the time, wildlife conflicts with chimney swifts are not the birds causing issues for us, but us causing issues for them. Swifts may roost inside of chimneys because they are almost exact replicas of the nesting trees in which swifts use in the forest, which have largely been demolished because of human encroachment. Remember, swifts are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and anyone who purposefully destroys birds or their nests that might contain eggs or young can be fined and penalized. ​Tolerance If you hear loud chattering coming out of your fireplace, it may be chimney swifts. Because swifts only occupy a nest for a few weeks, they should only make noise in your home for no more than two to three weeks.  Coupled with the fact that these birds are protected by federal law and it is illegal to interfere in any way with their nests, eggs, or babies, tolerance is the best method for dealing with them.  You can remove the nests after the birds have left. Prevention To ensure chimney swifts do not roost in your chimney, install a chimney cap.  A well-constructed and properly maintained cap will prevent all kinds of birds and wildlife from entering your chimney.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/9-years","Celebrating 9 Years of Victories byLaura Jellum|Apr 13, 2024 On April 14, we celebrate our 9th birthday. In 2015, Humane Action Pittsburgh was founded in a church basement when 45 dreamers assembled and dared to ask, “What if.” Now, with 26 HAP-initiated pieces of legislation signed into law, we’d like to look back at some of the victories we’ve celebrated over the years that have contributed to us becoming Western Pennsylvania’s most impactful animal protection nonprofit. Retail Sales Ban, 2015 We worked on the passage of two ordinances in Pittsburgh to safeguard mill-bred animals. Firstly, we implemented a retail sales ban, prohibiting the commercial sale of dogs, cats, and rabbits not from shelters or rescues within city limits, a pioneering move in Pennsylvania. Additionally, licensed breeders and kennels are now required to disclose their licenses in all advertisements. We brought these laws to  other towns like Sharpsburg, Bellevue, Monessen, and Wilkinsburg.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/9-years","Bullhook Plus Ban, 2017 We created and worked towards the passage of the Bullhook Plus Ban that prohibits the use of bullhooks, electric prods, shocking devices, and other instruments capable of inflicting pain, intimidating, or threatening pain for the purpose of controlling the behavior of wild or exotic animals, including elephants, lions, tigers, bears, and monkeys, in the city of Pittsburgh. This ban led to the cessation of all circuses, including the Shrine Circus, in Pittsburgh, with no future events planned.","text",5

Despite facing numerous obstacles, Councilperson Erika Strassburger and Councilman Bruce Kraus took the lead, resulting in the passage of this landmark legislation with a decisive vote of 7 – 2.","text",7

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/9-years","Pigeon Protection, 2020 In 2015, Pittsburgh City Council passed Ordinance No. 36 to protect wild birds but inadvertently allowed unqualified trapping, causing harm and safety risks. Collaborating with Councilor Bruce Kraus in 2020, HAP introduced an amendment restricting bird trapping to licensed professionals and banning the sale of native wild birds, disrupting the supply to pigeon shoots and preventing harm from pest control companies. On March 23, 2021, four people were arrested after a HAP member found ten pigeons convulsing near the Frick Building in downtown Pittsburgh on Thanksgiving Day 2021, having ingested Avitrol, a chemical illegal in Pittsburgh due to HAP’s amendment efforts in March 2020. Traveling Exotic Animal Ban, 2018 In April 2018, collaborating with Sharpsburg, we pioneered a ban on traveling exotic animal performances in Pennsylvania. Following this, HAP partnered with Bellevue for a similar ban. This precedent has spurred other towns in Pennsylvania to act, and HAP aims to extend the ban to more communities, building momentum for a statewide prohibition. Heart of a Hero/Get Healthy Pittsburgh, 2019/2022/2024 In 2019, we teamed up with the City of Pittsburgh and Engine 2 for the Heart of a Hero Campaign, highlighting the impact of food choices on health. Employees from various departments embraced a 7-day 100% plant-based diet challenge, resulting in an impressive 22-point drop in average cholesterol levels. Many reported increased energy and a commitment to continue the lifestyle change. Expanding on this success, our Get Healthy Pittsburgh! initiative, led by Dr. Sandra Sobel, introduced a pay-what-you-can model in 2024, making the program accessible to all. Participants received holistic support including biometric screenings, nutritional coaching, and physical activities, with a focus on a week-long whole food plant-based diet challenge known for its health benefits.","text",9

HAP tirelessly educated representatives and the public on the resolution’s significance through correspondence, meetings, educational materials, and a visit to Harrisburg, the state capital, benefiting both wildlife and human residents of Pennsylvania. Swissvale Pollinator Garden, 2022 In collaboration with Swissvale Borough Council, Humane Action Pittsburgh initiated the creation of a pollinator garden on a vacant lot, spanning 12,000 square feet. This space will provide vital habitat for bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. Volunteers from HAP, the Shade Tree Committee, and the community have been instrumental in preparing the site, participating in monthly workdays to clean, seed, plant, and maintain the garden.","text",11

We all want to go into the new year focused on things we would like to accomplish, and goals we would like to achieve. For some people, that can mean a pledge to go vegan. Whether you are interested in transitioning to a vegan lifestyle because of issues related to animals, your health, or the environment, if your resolutions involve going vegan for 2022, there has never been a better time to do so! Not only is the availability of vegan foods and products changing on a daily basis, with the introduction of new items, but restaurants are seeing the trend towards consuming less animal products and are offering vegan items. Did you ever think you would see the day when Burger King had a vegan option? Yes, the times are changing!","text",3

In 2021, more than 500,000 people across the world took part in Veganuary, and you can too! How, you ask? Simply sign up to take the pledge at the site:VeganuaryEasy, right? Once registered, you will receive the Official Veganuary Starter Kit, which provides 31 days of coaching, recipes, and suggestions on how to successfully complete the 31-day challenge. It’s completely free, and you can opt-out at any time. Veganuary has established itself as a successful way for people to completely cut out or at least significantly reduce their use of animal products. In fact, 85 percent of 2021 participants said they planned to cut their consumption of animal products in half through the rest of the year, while 40 percent said they would continue to eat vegan. Locally, Pittsburgh has several resources to help you on your vegan journey as well, including the following: Here’s to a happy 2022, one that leaves the animals off our plates!

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/covid-19-and-the-next-pandemic/","As the world slows down to help flatten the curve in order to order to halt the spread of the Coronavirus, which leads to the disease known as COVID-19, analysts and talking heads are positing how the world moves forward once this crisis is over. One thing that is not being talked about, on a large scale, however, is how likely it is that another pandemic can happen. How, you ask? By another zoonotic transmission between the animals that humans consume. While it is one thing to point the finger at the wet markets in China that have been identified of the source of this outbreak, realizing that another outbreak could be brewing is not unrealistic. There has been a long history of viruses borne from human interactions with animals, including, H1N1, swine flu, and now COVID-19. Similarly, outbreaks of salmonella and e. coli have been tied to consumption of animal products in the past. In the Chinese city of Wuhan, the origin of this latest version of the Coronavirus has been linked to so-called “wet markets,” where all manners of wild animals are bought and sold for human consumption. It’s clear that it is time for us to reconsider our treatment of and commodification of animals, if not only for the protection of the animals, but also for the protection of the human race and the elimination of future pandemics that could lead to more quarantine-like situations and the collapse of economic and health systems across the world.

With a wide variety of attractions, ranging from art to food to great nature, this city is a paragon for the best of both worlds: small-town charm and big-city convenience. However, with travel season upon us, we know staying vegan while vacationing isn’t exactly smooth sailing. Fortunately, Pittsburgh is filled with countless fun activities everyone can enjoy without having to worry about breaking their veganism.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-perfect-vegan-weekend/","Apteka, a vegan restaurant featuring Eastern and Central European cuisine, allows its customers to enjoy the city’s Polish heritage without having to eat kielbasa. This restaurant was opened in 2016 by Kate Lasky and Tomasz Skowronski who designed a menu forged from Skowronski’s Polish roots and Lasky’s sixth-generation Pittsburgh culinary lineage. Together, they designed a constantly evolving menu while paying homage to Polish cuisine. Lasky and Skowronski have also kept their restaurant sustainable by developing deep relationships with farmers in the Pittsburgh area such as Bitter Ends Farm Co. and Clarion River Organics. The duo also handpick hundreds of pounds of fruits, and Skowronski’s parents contribute boxes of foraged ingredients, every year. Some highly recommended dishes from Apteka include faszerowane pomidory (oxheart tomato stuffed with long rice, zucchini, onion, and fermented tomato); rwaki (foraged chanterelle mushrooms, yellow wax beans, potato noodles, tomato, and burnt cabbage broth); kartofle z jogurtem migdałowym (boiled potatoes with lingonberry jam and nut-milk-based yogurt); and sunflower seed ice cream. Named one of the New York Times’ Top 50 favorite restaurants last year, Apteka is nationally renowned. Lasky and Skowronski have also recently been named finalists for the James Beard Award and were recognized as the Best Chefs in the Mid-Atlantic category. Currently, Apteka is working towards creating a beverage program that features a selection of natural wines. Pure Grub –209 Commercial Ave, Aspinwall, PA 15215","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-perfect-vegan-weekend/","Asanté Bierria launched Pure Grub to evangelize wholesome, healthy food to everyone in Pittsburgh. Everything prepared at Pure Grub is vegan, gluten-free, and organic. Rather than using mock meat, Bierria draws from his West Indian, Cuban, and South American heritage to deliver impactful flavors that highlight the power of natural ingredients. This restaurant has quickly become a staple at Pittsburgh’s farmers markets and Bierria can be found all over the city on different days offering his unique dishes, making it easy for tourists to stop by while exploring Pittsburgh. One of Bierria’s most famous dishes is his “Journey to the Soul”, which he serves on the first Thursday of every month. Featuring vegan versions of jambalaya and ye’abesha gomen, he spotlights the impact of the spice trade on modern America. However, Bierria doesn’t confine his dishes to specific geographic regions; as a strong proponent that there is an entire world of plant-based cuisine to explore, it isn’t unexpected of him to utilize anything ranging from Japanese sweet potatoes to chia seeds.

As a vegan at home, it gnawed at him that the bakery he bought back in 2004 was still using butter and eggs in their products, which is why he was so adamant about converting his bakery into one that was 100% vegan. Many baked goods rely on eggs and dairy for their structure and function. For example, butter is a staple in baking because of the plasticity and sweet tang that it provides. But after testing 75 iterations of butter, Abuheljeh succeeded in formulating a butter that was made from fermented sunflower seeds and fermented oat milk. Today, Allegro’s croissants have the same flakiness and rich, comforting flavor one would expect from an original croissant. After some more experimentation, Abuheljeh recently added a line of sandwiches and other grab-and-go items to his menu. Thus, for those who love baked goods, stopping by Allegro is a must.

Bigger fish then eat the smaller fish, and you can imagine where those contaminated fish might end up: on many dinner plates. The potential impact on human health is staggering.

For a close-up look,One Green Planetposted a collection of videos that illustrate the tragedy happening to sea animals. If you follow the link, please note that the images are graphic and disturbing. What makes all of this even worse is that I stumbled on articles about how fish are sentient beings.

Winter is here and wildlife are gearing up for the cold months ahead. Miraculous adaptations prepare wildlife for the cold temperatures, however, a little bit of help is always welcome.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/winter-wildlife/","Many different species of wildlife have their own unique mechanism for surviving harsh winter conditions. The white-tailed deer exchanges its warm weather coat for one more suitable for frigid temperatures, the groundhog goes into hibernation, honey bees huddle together in their hives, and raccoons and chipmunks enter torpor, a less drastic version of hibernation. Despite all these amazingly strategic adaptations, we should still support our local wildlife. One significant way is to provide appropriate food. During the winter months, finding food to maintain proper nutrition is a challenge for wildlife due to the scarcity of their natural diet. The berries, seeds, and bugs eaten by birds and squirrels and many other wildlife are no longer a viable source of nourishment, which can cause loss of life in many species. Making foods such as mixed seeds, plant-based suet, peanuts, and dried fruits available in your backyard will provide the necessary fats and sugars birds and small mammals need for warmth and energy. Cracked corn is also an option but only during the extremely cold months as it has a much higher fat content. It is ideal to use a wire mesh feeder for birds so that they can peck at the food and avoid choking. If you don’t have a feeder just be sure to crush any nuts into small pieces.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/winter-wildlife/","Just as proper nutrition is important for wildlife in freezing temperatures, so is hydration. Putting out fresh water in a proper container is an easy way to ensure hydration and help wildlife conserve energy in their search for water. An ideal container should be shallow with a sturdy place to stand while drinking. If you have a pond or a bird bath, breaking the ice is also an option to provide drinking water. Another way to help is to let your backyard go wild. We all have a propensity to want to keep our yards neat and tidy, but this actually inhibits wildlife from finding sanctuary when they need it the most. Leaving piles of leaves, shrubs and other debris undisturbed during the winter provides many animals and insects with warmth and shelter as well as a place to hide, rest and hibernate. Because of this, it is important to always check that pile of logs before burning in case it is being used as a home by mice, snakes, frogs and other small creatures. Winter months are such a difficult time for all woodland creatures. Local wildlife rescues such as, Humane Animal Rescue of Pittsburgh, are often inundated with animals in need of care. They also have a higher volume of animals in their care even if they have already been rehabilitated due to needing to wait till warmer months to release the animal. This is the perfect opportunity to help by donating time, money or supplies to your local wildlife rescue or HAP’s Love your Wild Neighbor campaign, which aims to educate the public about the inhumane and ineffective trapping practices used in Pittsburgh and provide the city and its residents with humane wildlife conflict solutions.

While that claim turned out to befalse…maybe the idea shouldn’t be dismissed so quickly. Hear me out.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/a-hamburgers-carbon-footprint/","Image courtesy of NASA We all know that carbon emissions are a problem, and many companies and individuals are working hard to reduce their carbon footprints. The city of Pittsburgh has expressed concern about the impact of carbon emissions on climate and has implemented aClimate Action Plan, which states that “Pittsburgh has already begun to experience the effects of climate change with harsher winters, hotter summers, record setting precipitation, and increased numbers of invasive species. Coordinated, concentrated and comprehensive carbon mitigation action is needed to reduce the severity of regional impacts and prepare for low carbon economy.” But if you read through it, there is no mention of meat or animal product consumption or production. But (for good reason) that wasn’t always the case. Previous versions of the city’s Climate Action Plan included a meat reduction goal of 50% by 2030, but that goal was removed. Why? First, let’s look at the source of the rumors surrounding Biden’s climate plan. A University of Michiganstudyin 2020 examined the carbon emissions of meat, comparing several models of meat and animal product consumption. That study found that greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced to 51% by 2030 if beef consumption (hence the hamburger headline) decreased by 90% and all other animal-based foods decreased by 50%. While some of you may already know about the environmental impact of meat and animal products, others may be scratching their heads, wondering what a cow or a chicken has to do with greenhouse gas emissions. Let’s explore that question. Cows and other herbivorous livestock emit methane gas as a byproduct of their digestive systems. Methane is up to 32%more potentthan CO2. That means that just existing and digesting grass creates greenhouse gasses on its own. Take into consideration the amount of food a cow has to eat (and then digest) in order to grow to the size considered appropriate for slaughter.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/a-hamburgers-carbon-footprint/","Of course, all animal products impact the environment in many ways outside of their greenhouse gas emissions. For example,this graphicshows the comparison between cow’s milk and plant milk in terms of both CO2emissions and water usage required. And UK-based organizationCarbon Briefreports that “The conversion of land for beef production and animal feed is a leading cause of deforestation in many tropical regions, including in the Amazon, where a recent spike in forest fires and clearing has been linked to cattle ranching.”","text",8

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/a-hamburgers-carbon-footprint/","Image courtesy of Statista So when there are so many negative impacts for the environment when it comes to animal products, why is there such an uproar when there is even a suspicion that a politician may have an anti-meat agenda? Well, there’s almost certainly some level of outrage being manufactured by farmers who raise animals for meat or dairy, but at the same time, many Americans do feel a certain emotional attachment to what they may see as a basically patriotic act of grilling burgers in their backyards. Many people grew up eating meat and don’t want to stop. I would suggest, though, that knowing what we know about the climate, omnivorous Americans should think of it this way: going vegan, vegetarian, or even just reducing animal product consumption is one of the biggest personal choices an individual can make to protect the environment, especially from climate change. And the 2020s seem to be the decade of the plant-based alternative, with plant-based milk gaining widespreadpopularityand the emergence of newer, flashier meat alternatives likeImpossibleandBeyond.","text",10

She writes: This handsome guy is Max.  He came from Fayette County Humane Society.​After our wonderful dog Ruby passed away, we made a decision to provide a home for another rescue.  When I went to the shelter, I was looking at all the dogs that were placed front and center.  None of them “did it for me.” The one volunteer said to me, “There is this dog over here. No one else likes him, but I love him.” ​I asked why no one liked him and she said, “well, sometimes he can be a bit cranky and nip.” She walked me over to a far cage in a corner on the ground and there was Max, curled up in the back of the cage. I sat down on the floor cross-legged, and she opened the cage and coaxed Max to come out.  He came out tentatively, saw me, walked over to me, and sniffed.  He then did something amazing; he stepped into my crossed legs, looked up at me and curled down in between my legs.  Needless to say he came home with me. Almost 8 years later, he still has the attitude, but is a dedicated, loving member of our family. No one can say where Max would be if he hadn’t been adopted, but we can say where he is now–in a warm, loving, and happy home where he enjoys views of the Youghiogheny River and the company of  his foster-brother, Reggie.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/why-we-adopt-dont-shop/","Reggie, photo courtesy of Bill Meyers Shelley’s husband, Bill, shared the following about Max’s younger brother Reggie: I’d like to introduce my new best friend, Reggie. His qualifications for becoming my best friend were simple. He is a dog, and we connected immediately. While adding in the facts that I found him alone…in a small pen…in a kill shelter somewhat influenced my decision,  it was his initial laid-back approach to me that instantly won me over. ​As I walked down the line of cages filled with barking, howling canines desperate to get my attention, I came upon the small space where my soon-to-be bestie was…sleeping! Yep, amid the chaos he was soundly napping. Intrigued, I tapped on the pen several times and finally got a response. The small puppy with the already-adult paws slowing stretched, shook a few times, and wandered over to me. I held out the back of my hand and, without hesitation, he gave me the first of what would be endless kisses. Nothing else. No barking. No jumping around. We locked eyes for a moment and I was hooked. He really knew how to sell it. He’s now enjoying his forever home, and he daily reinforces the fact that, despite digging holes in the yard and chewing on forbidden objects, I made one of the best decisions of my life. While it’s heartbreaking to think that otherwise-healthy animals are sometimes euthanized, it’s important to remember that adopt, don’t shop campaigns have significantly reduced the number of such shelters and have reduced the numbers of animals euthanized each year, as documented by theASPCA. The more of us make the choice to adopt these shelter animals, the fewer animals will be subjected to euthenasia or even just extended, lonely shelter stays.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/why-we-adopt-dont-shop/","Rosie and Moo, photo courtesy of Ellen Lewis Ellen and husband Josh care for two delightful canines, Rosie and Moo. Both were adopted from shelters and both bring them immense joy. Ellen writes: We adopted Rosie in October 2011 and have had her since she was a puppy. The driving force was simply that we wanted a dog to take care of, and she had a sweet demeanor among all the other puppies available. We’ve had her for nearly her entire life and have grown a strong bond — she is very obedient, intelligent, and has a great demeanor around people. ​We adopted Moo in 2018 because we wanted a playmate for Rosie. Moo had a history and a previous owner, and he spent some time in the shelter as an adult (he was 3 when we adopted him and had been in the shelter for about 8 months), so his personality reflects some insecurity/abandonment as a result of separating from his previous owner and his previous dog companion (who was adopted from the shelter before Moo). He’s not quite as obedient as Rosie, but has made great strides in the two-ish years we’ve had him. He’s also very bonded to me.","text",9

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/why-we-adopt-dont-shop/","Moo and Rosie in bandanas, photo courtesy of Ellen Lewis They’re great together. They love playing together but, more than that, they enjoy just hanging out together. I’ve caught them curled up together on the couch more than a few times. I’m not sure of Moo’s personality before we had him, but I can tell he finds comfort in Rosie’s presence and has no problem letting her be the leader between them. On the flip side, Moo seems to have brought out a more playful side in Rosie. We’ve always called her a “people dog,” because she gravitates toward people and not other dogs (in the dog park, out in public, etc.), but she sure has become more playful since Moo came around. We love taking them on hikes around the area — it’s great exercise for all of us and the dogs get some great physical and mental stimulation. We also taught them to hug one another on command when we ask “Who’s your best friend?” So really, it doesn’t get any better than that! Ellen also noted that she and Josh had no idea what they were going to get when they adopted these pups, explaining that it’s hard to know a dog’s breed or even how the dog’s personality will come across when you get him home and he spends time around the family, including other animals. Based on this variability, it’s important that, when you adopt a dog, you don’t go in expecting the dog to be a certain way, but that you are prepared to love him and to be patient as he adjusts to his new home. Dogs aren’t the only companion animals!","text",11

Besides being adorable and low-maintenance, there are tons of great reasons to adopt a cat. For one thing, did you know that house cats are not indigenous to North America? Yep, and a 2013studypublished in Nature Communications tells us that domestic cats kill somewhere between 1.4 and 3.7 birds in the lower 48 states each year.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/why-we-adopt-dont-shop/","Photo courtesy ofClaire Kmetz While the question of how to minimize the damage posed by feral cats is obviously fraught, the very best way I’ve found to make a difference is to get feral cats off the streets (and out of the back yards and local farms and forests where they can decimate local bird populations), spay or neuter them, and then bring them into my home where they can live long, happy lives in a warm environment with plenty of food and veterinary care, without damaging the local ecosystem. If you haven’t considered adopting a cat before, I highly recommend you think about it! They are great for young people who don’t spend a lot of time at home, people who work long shifts, or elderly people who struggle to keep up with dogs’ exercise and socialization needs.  They don’t need to be housetrained and they are independent. And look at those faces! It’s impossible to resist these beauties. At the end of the day, companion animals bring us tremendous joy, especially in times of increased loneliness that many of us are experiencing or have experienced in 2020. We can help other living beings by bringing them into our homes, and the animals at your local animal shelters will bring you as much or more joy than any bought from a commercial breeder. If you have the resources to care for an animal and the local shelter near you has animals that need homes, it’s a great idea to adopt, not shop!

Unfortunately, there is a plethora of misconceptions surrounding betta fish, much to the extreme detriment of these beautiful, sentient creatures Danger in Procurement and Transfer While some bettas are captured in the wild, the vast majority of those sold in the US come frombreeding farms in Thailand and other countries in Southeast Asia, where it is common practice tokeep them in small bottles. When it is time to pack them for transport, fish are haphazardlydumped into baskets covered with nets and scooped into tiny plastic cups. Then, they’re packedup to be sent to the US. Common pet store suppliers, like Segrest Farms, admit to sourcing bettasfrom Thailand. When betta fish are shipped to countries around the world, the journey can take several days.Bettas are commonly transported withoutany food and barely any water Workers have told eyewitnesses that atranquilizer is added to the water so the fish won’t eat their own tails in desperation. During transport, bettas are confined individually to incredibly tiny bagsthat are stuffed into boxes and then stacked up high in massive wholesale warehouses Many bettas die before reaching their intended destination. According to one pet store worker, awell-knownsupplier often ships 100,000 betta fish per week to the U.S. and up to 1,000 of the fish die before they reach distributors.","text",3

Dead and dying fish were found floating in tinycups of contaminated water, and some were left to suffer from painful or debilitating healthconcerns, even though they were clearly in need of veterinary care. Some specific eyewitness accounts include: Instead of taking these fish to aveterinarian, employees simply guessed at diagnoses and left them to suffer. A betta who hadarrived at a store floating on his side because of a swim bladder issue was left tolanguish that way for months. The pet store’s solution?Sell the fish at a discount.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/regional-initiatives/freedom-for-fish/the-truth-about-betta-fish","Forced to Live Cruel and Unnatural Lives In the wild, bettas live in Asia, where their homes are the shallow waters of rice paddies, ponds, or slow-moving streams. Since those waters aren’t deep, they stay warm, which is whybettaswho live in human homes require a regularly cleaned aquarium with at least 10 gallons of water heated tobetween 76 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit, a good filtration system, and enrichments, such as caves,rocks, and live plants. Selling bettas in tiny bowls or cups perpetuates theharmful myth that Bettas are easy “starter” pets that must be kept in tanks alone.Bettas do NOT have to live alone.Female bettas can live together, and while male bettas will fight with other males, they can beplaced in a “community” aquarium containing other species of fish Plant roots are NOT adequate food for betta fish. Bettas are carnivorous animals who, in nature,eat mostly insects and insect larvae. Pet shops, discount superstores, florists, and even online catalogs sell “decorative” bettas insmall cups or flower vases. The fish often live in just a few ounces of water, which is hardlyenough to turn around in, much less swim in. In addition, keeping bettas in small glass or vases with plants makes it hard for them to breathe, because they get their oxygen from the surface of the water,and anarrow container with a plant can interfere with this. Further, a diet consisting solely of plant roots may keep them alivefor a while, but since it lacks the proper nutrients for this species, the fish eventually becomesick and starve to death. Instead of swimming as far as they want in the wild, bettas sold as pets are forced to exist in tinyglass bowls or vases that are way too small and cold for them.","text",11

Bettas stop killing eachother and instead exhibit cooperative group behavior when they’re released from the“artificiality of captivity.” However, these sensitive fish continue to suffer greatly in the pet trade,where they’re subjected to inadequate care from the time they’re born on breeding farms towhen they’re transported to pet stores and to when they’re ultimately sold.","text",13

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/regional-initiatives/freedom-for-fish/the-truth-about-betta-fish","What Is HAP Doing About It? Our first step is to educate the public of the inhumane treatment fish encounter when caught from the wild to be imprisoned in tiny tanks as pets or killed for food. Awareness is key while fighting for the lives of fish, who are capable of remembering past social interactions with other fish and show affection by rubbing up against one another. Through our“Better for Betta Fish”campaign, we’re working with pet stores to stop the sale of betta fish as pets, leaving them in their natural habitat to thrive. How You Can Help Change starts with you! If there isn’t a demand for fish as food or ornamental decoration, the supply and terrible practices will decrease. Please help us in taking a stand against the fishing industry and senseless lives lost. Learning about the horrors of the fishing industry and the plight of Betta fish captured and sold as pets–and educating others about these issues–can help. You can also help to educate pet stores where you see injured, sick, or abused fish, if you feel comfortable doing so.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/ownership-of-reptiles-banned-in-pittsburgh/","This Spring, HAP is celebrating a majorvictory for reptiles: “On Tuesday, March 23, Pittsburgh City Council unanimously passedOrdinance No. 36, which bans the ownership of any Crocodilian species or any Red-eared slider, which includes alligators, crocodiles, caimans, gharials, and red-eared slider turtles. As HAP members know, HAP wrote this Ordinance and has been advocating for it along with the Pittsburgh Police and Humane Animal Rescue of Pittsburgh. Following multiple incidents of these animals being abandoned, neglected, and inhumanely housed, Pittsburgh City Council took the necessary steps to ban ownership outright, with minimal exceptions for medical and educational institutions, veterinarians, and AZA accredited zoological parks.” Many Pittsburghers will remember the mysteriousalligatorsightings in 2019, when it seemed like these animals were turning up on the streets of Pittsburgh nearly every week. While the stories were treated with a general mixture of bewilderment and vague amusement, they really were no laughing matter. These animals can, of course, be dangerous to people and pets, but they also face dangers of their own in a city that is not built to handle them.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/ownership-of-reptiles-banned-in-pittsburgh/","After the aforementioned spate of alligator sightings in the ‘burgh, the City Council passed someregulationsrequiring specific, labeled enclosures for the animals but, unfortunately, these rules were concerned primarily with the animals’ potential to escape, not with the wellbeing of the animals. However, with this new ordinance, Pittsburgh’s policy on reptiles received a more humane update. Under the new ordinance, as stated, sale and ownership of alligators, crocodiles, and red-eared slider turtles is not permitted in the city, although zoos with AZA accreditation can still possess them. HAP lead blogger Aimee Douglass wrote back inSeptemberabout the Pittsburgh Zoo’s ZAA accreditation compared with the gold-standard AZA accreditation, and you may have heard that, as we hadaskedfor some time, the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium has agreed topursue recertificationwith the AZA, leaving them eligible to hold these reptiles–another cause for celebration for animals in Pittsburgh. This new legislation is a big victory for reptiles for a few reasons. First, past legislation did not includered-eared sliders, but these popular pets are long-lived invasive species who, when released, can out-compete with native species, and who deserve to live their long lives in freedom instead of cramped captivity.","text",7
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/ownership-of-reptiles-banned-in-pittsburgh/","https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org//wp-content/uploads/2021/04/red-eared_slider_stahlman_july18_0.jpg","image",8
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/ownership-of-reptiles-banned-in-pittsburgh/","Second, the original 2019 ordinance contained requirements for alligators and other reptiles to be kept in cramped quarters which prevented their escape, but these animals are not meant to live that way. They benefit from large territories where they can roam freely, and they don’t benefit from human companionship. Many other states prohibit the inhumane sale of these animals, and Pittsburgh is now catching up. So what is next for HAP when it comes to protecting these creatures? It’s vital that this ban be enforced, but also that individuals who currently possess these animals know what to do–or, namely, what not to do. As mentioned above, crocodiles and alligators are not well-suited to a populated city, nor are they suited to the climate of southwestern Pennsylvania. On the other hand, red eared sliders are positioned to become invasive. For these reasons, none of these animals should, under any circumstances, be released into the wild, no matter how far from the city. The legislation did provide some exceptions for individuals who already do own these animals to prevent this from happening. Post Gazette writer Ashley Murrayexplains, “The ordinance allows exceptions for those who have owned the pet reptiles for the past six months, given that they adhere to new criteria including: pay a yet-to-be-determined registration fee; alert the city’s Bureau of Animal Care and Control should the critter escape and in the case of owning a crocodilian species; and carry liability insurance in the minimum amount of $1 million.” What can the average HAP member do to help? Most of us aren’t keeping these reptiles as pets, but it’s possible we may know someone who is. Just as we reached out to the City Council to promote the passage of this ban, we should similarly continue to share information about its passage on our social media platforms and with our friends and family. We can make sure our local pet stores are informed about the ban, too.","text",9

Not at all. Four years ago, he took up residence on our front porch in the bitter cold of December, huddled on a chair against the elements with dirty feet and sad, wary eyes. He was known to bite and bolt quickly – instincts he honed as an outside cat for the first year of his life where kindness wasn’t often on the day’s schedule, especially as a pesky outside cat scrounging in trash cans and causing a ruckus in alleyways.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/how-trap-neuter-return-helps-community-cats/","Four years ago, my partner and I worked to transform this feral boy from a suspicious, distrustful cat to an indoor one who enjoys the comforts of home with his parents and cat siblings. It was hard work that made us question if we were equipped to help him. We had to slowly gain his trust through first just sitting near him as he chowed down outside. We then made our porch a makeshift shelter from the elements, providing food and fresh, unfrozen water in the dead of winter. Slow and steady is the way to go with feral and semi-feral cats. Thankfully, we’ve come a long way since those days. Jeffrey happily snuggles on my lap and is even picky about the types of wet food he’ll eat at lunchtime – a process that took close to a year before he acclimated well to indoor life, as seen below.","text",7

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/how-trap-neuter-return-helps-community-cats/","However, the focus of this blog isn’t only to gush about Jeffrey, the feral turned friendly. Instead, I’d like to share what I learned throughout the process of helping and loving this formerly outdoor cat with you, so you can also lend a hand to help the Jeffreys of the world, even if they don’t become cuddly, indoor cats. It’s no secret that feral and stray cats are in dire straits. Outside cats can be prone todisease and infections, fighting, and overpopulation without human intervention. Unaltered male cats maychallenge each other over territorial disputes, leading to wounds that can get infected quickly outdoors. Unspayed female cats are able toreproduce beginning at six months, and produce an average of 1.5 litters with four kittens each annually. These cats are just doing what comes naturally, and part of the reason there are so many of them is because everyone tends to believe outdoor cats are “someone else’s problem.” With an estimated 32 million feral cats living in the U.S., there is no time like the present to help these community cats. So, how can you assist? Introducing Trap, Neuter, Return (TNR). You may have heard oftrap, neuter, return (TNR) programsbefore, but here’s a refresher. As part ofTNR, cats are humanely trapped and taken to a vet to be neutered (if male) or spayed (if female), effectively stopping the breeding cycle and helping to prevent cat overpopulation. Feral or stray cats will also be given arabies and FVRCP vaccine, which is a “three-in-one combination vaccine protecting cats from rhinotracheitis, calicivirus and panleukopenia (also known as feline distemper).” Cats taken in for TNR will also be given an ear tip. Ear tipping is where a tiny section (3/8”) of the top of their (typically left) ear is clipped while they’re under anesthesia and is a painless procedure.","text",9
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/how-trap-neuter-return-helps-community-cats/","This ear tip indicates a cat is a community one who has already been fixed and vaccinated, so rescuers can see at a glance which cats have already been helped and which cats still need to be seen. Ear tipping is also a time saver, as a cat with an ear tip in a trap can quickly be let out as opposed to taking an unnecessary trip to the vet to determine if they’ve been fixed.","text",10
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/how-trap-neuter-return-helps-community-cats/","Jeffrey sports an ear tip too, as we weren’t sure if he would like indoor life during our first few months of knowing each other. We wanted to be sure people knew he was neutered and vaccinated if he ever ended up in a TNR trap outside. However, the comforts of a regularly scheduled meal every day, baseboard heat, and pets won him over pretty quickly.","text",11

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/how-trap-neuter-return-helps-community-cats/","Steps for TNR When we first met Jeffrey, we knew he probably wasn’t fixed and would benefit from that surgery along with a veterinary check up and vaccinations. Luckily, as a cat cafe volunteer who had heard a bit about TNR before, I knew of the concept and reached out to friends and acquaintances who had participated in TNR previously. I’ll outline what I learned in the steps below. Step #1: Understand that the person or rescue to help may beyou. With so much going on in the world and everyone’s lives, it’s easy to think a community cat problem or stray cat that keeps showing up on your porch are issues for another person to handle. The important thing to remember is that cat rescues, shelters, and volunteers are also extremely busy in their own lives in the cat world since there is such an overpopulation of cats, and their personal lives. Rescues and shelters may also be dealing with staffing issues due to COVID-19 and the toll rescuing takes on one’s mental health, and overwhelmed trying to help every cat and kitten they’re contacted about. Despite shelters and rescuer’s best efforts, it’s impossible for a select few or very small group to help every single community cat. The good news is this is where you come in. You can help and be a hero to that one cat that needs it! Step #2: Determine if the cats are already receiving help or have dedicated caretakers or rescuers. The last thing you’d want to do is disturb a happy cat colony that is being well cared for by caretakers. Make sure you ask around and check out social media, perhaps even making a post yourself, to ensure you aren’t duplicating efforts of a rescue group or other like-minded individual. You may also be able to find local TNR programs and organizations that can help you and provide assistance throughout this process. Step #3: Have a plan. TNR isn’t something you should do on a whim. Read as much as you can about TNR and how it works. Do your research.","text",13
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/how-trap-neuter-return-helps-community-cats/","Again, a local rescuer or shelter may be able to help guide you, but the internet and blogs like this exist for a reason.","text",14
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/how-trap-neuter-return-helps-community-cats/","Make sure you know where you can take a trapped cat, such as a local spay/neuter clinic or veterinary hospital, before you attempt to trap a community cat. You can also call ahead and see what the clinic’s schedule is for the week or month to determine when the best days to catch your furry friend (or frenemy) may be. Speaking of that trapped cat, do you have a trap to first catch and then transport the cat in? Do you know how the trap works and how to set it? Will the trap fit in your vehicle as you transport the cat to the clinic? If not, do you have a friend or family member you can contact to use their truck or larger vehicle? How will you pay for the services offered by the vet? Are there low- or no-cost spay/neuter clinics near you, or can you partner with a rescue or shelter through a grant they’ve received to help offset costs? Can you start a fundraiser within your own community to help pay for TNR? You’ll have to consider these questions and more before you scoop that cat up off the street. Alley Cat Allies has a great guide to get you startedhere. Part of your plan should also include where you can keep the recently fixed cat overnight. The cat “should be left in the trap or carrier in which they were placed in after surgery and should be kept in a warm, draft-free area such as abathroom, spare bedroom, basement, or climate-controlled garage at about 70 degrees. Because cats cannot regulate their body temperature while under anesthesia, you must make sure they don’t get too warm or too cold overnight.” Be sure to monitor your temporary furbaby every hour or so to make sure they’re okay and don’t need any emergency medical attention. The Camden County Animal Shelter Spay/Neuter Clinic Sheet has more info on surgery recoveryhere. Always listen to the advice provided by the veterinarian and staff at the clinic or hospital to ensure proper care and recovery of the cat. Step #4: Take action.","text",15
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/how-trap-neuter-return-helps-community-cats/","If you’ve done your research and have contacted a clinic or vet’s office for an appointment to get your community cat fixed, well done! You can now start the process armed with the knowledge of what you can do to help not only this one cat, but also the cat community and shelters and rescues in your area. Remember to have patience with the cat and the people who assist you in this new endeavor.","text",16
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/how-trap-neuter-return-helps-community-cats/","Alley Cat Allies has an entire section oncat care to help. Check out these resources as well for more info: Neighborhood Cats – 7 Steps of TNR Alley Cat Allies in Action PetFinder – How to TNR Feral Cats Once the cat has safely recovered from their procedure (typically about 24 hours after their procedure, barring any issues), they are ready to be returned to the area where you found them. It’s recommended that you don’t simply release the cat from your front door into the unknown, but instead take them back to the area they call home. You wouldn’t want to be dropped off in an unfamiliar place after surgery, and neither does the cat. Step #5: Repeat, educate, and assist! Congratulations, you’ve helped a community cat live a better, healthier life. If you’re so inclined and know the area where there are more community cats, you can help them, too. Perhaps you can coordinate with others to provide general caretaking for these cats, setting them up with shelters with straw for warmth (never blankets as they freeze and can freeze to a cat and make it even colder), food, and water (which should be kept warm in the winter to prevent freezing). Get others engaged in your efforts by sharing your experience and helping those who want to be involved. We all have to work together to help with cat overpopulation while caring for cats who were left behind or dumped by former owners, or left to their own devices as completely feral furballs. Cats can’t advocate for themselves. We can help! I understand that everyone does not have the time, means, or money to help community cats in their area. But even helping in small ways makes a huge difference. Whether you share a rescue’s post on social media, volunteer at a rescue or cat cafe, foster, donate time and money in other ways to help rescued or feral cats, or are inspired to do more or unique things to help felines in your area, it matters.","text",17

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/gardening-for-animals-and-the-earth-part-1/","Photo bychi liuonUnsplash Since Humane Action Pittsburgh’svisionis “a world without animal suffering where all beings are treated with compassion,” I wanted to focus in this ongoing series on the ways to manage a garden responsibly, to do so without causing harm to any of our wild neighbors, and to even provide some benefits to wildlife wherever possible. At this point, it’s too early to start putting plants in the ground, and I’m not a confident enough gardener to start plants from seeds, but I thought with the weather breaking and many of us starting to think about what our gardens will look like this year, it would be a good time to talk about some of the considerations we should take into account when planning a garden. What to Plant There are so many good options for what to plant to help animals and the Earth. Personally, I plan to focus on pollinator-friendly plants (native plants)andedible plants. Growing native flowering plants is a great way to not only attract butterflies and other pollinators to your garden, but also to help contribute to biodiversity.HAP Hiveis actively working to raise awareness about the crucial role pollinators play in our ecosystem and how communities and individuals can support them. In addition, HAP has been working with the Endangered Species Coalition to facilitate wildlife corridors in Pennsylvania, which you can read about in thisblog post. These campaigns remind us of our collective responsibility to create gardens that are good homes for pollinators and native insects and wildlife such as the insects and grubs that migratory birds eat. Sharing our gardens and yards with native plants that can feed pollinators and create homes for vital insects and grubs is one way we can make a positive difference. Check out Penn State’s explanation of the importance of native plants in Pennsylvanians’ gardens and yards, as well as a list of plants to considerhere.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/gardening-for-animals-and-the-earth-part-1/","Photo byClaire KmetzonFlickr We also have to be thoughtful about where we live. For example, my front yard touches a very busy road, and, since I also live near Riverview park, we share our neighborhood with wildlife, including several deer. As I’m planning my garden, it’s at the top of my mind that whatever I plant, I must ensure that anything a deer or other animal would want to eat is protected by natural barriers and other deterrents. Otherwise, I might unintentionally lure an animal close to the road where they could be injured or killed. For pollinator-friendly gardening, location also matters. Working with HAP has me interested in bee hotels like the ones HAP Hive plans to build (more details coming soon!), but due to the high volume of foot traffic near my yard and the close proximity of my neighbors, these aren’t a good fit for me–I don’t want to attract bees that might sting a neighbor or passerby with an allergy. However, keep an eye out for more information about bee hotels–depending on where you live, theymightbe a good fit for you!","text",7

Herbs are probably the starkest example I can think of to demonstrate how. They tend to be extremely easy to grow (so I’m told!), but up until now I’ve found myself buying them regularly in those plastic clamshell packs at Giant Eagle. As HAP’sNo Plastic Pleasecampaign has enumerated, plastic containers like these are the scourge of the Earth, ending up in our waterways and doing harm to not only our drinking water but also the homes of marine life forms, both as near as our own three rivers and as far as the oceans they run to. In addition to reducing packaging, growing herbs and vegetables in our own front yards reduces the carbon footprint for the food dramatically, and it helps us to access nutrient-rich plant-based food.","text",9

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/gardening-for-animals-and-the-earth-part-1/","Photo byMarkus SpiskeonUnsplash Protecting the Garden from Insects and Animals I’m also (finally!) taking up the call to begin composting. Now that I have the space, I feel I have no excuse not to. There are numerous composting methods out there, but I’m not comfortable with using worms or bacteria in my house, so I’m going with the good old fashioned method (stay tuned for an upcoming post about composting and how it not only helps the environment but also the other animals we share it with). Compost is a great fertilizer, but it does take time for organic matter we compost to break down. Therefore, I’ll be looking for other sources of composted matter while I wait for my own to be ready. Composting Since it’s my first year gardening, I have no idea what to expect in terms of insect or animal threats to my plants. However, I am researching humane methods of pest control and pledging to avoid chemical pesticides which are detrimental to pollinator life and could pose a health risk to humans as well. Right now, my plan is to use raised beds surrounded by fencing for all edible plants, thus keeping them reasonably inaccessible to animals looking for a vegetable buffet. As the season goes on, if I do develop problems with pests, I will report back with what strategies I use as humane deterrents and how effective they are. Gardening is a great way to get outside and do something positive for myself and the neighbors who walk past my house every day, not to mention the Earth, pollinators and insects, and all of us that rely on them. I look forward to embarking on this journey, but with some trepidation. I have no idea what a feat backyard composting will be, nor do I know how successful my first-year gardens will be. I look forward to sharing this journey with you, so that we can all learn together and have even better, more prosperous humane gardens in seasons to come.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/foxes/","Foxes Conflict Solutions Foxes tend to do what they can to avoid people.  However, with humans encroaching on their habitat, both red and gray foxes are being found more often in cities.  Don’t panic!  We have humane solutions to solve any of your fox conflicts. Under Your Porch, Deck, or Outdoor Stairs Foxes may be using these areas of your property for shelter from inclement winter weather.  If you find a fox family under your porch, deck, or outdoor stairs, please consider tolerating them there until the young are old enough.  At that point, they will leave on their own.  Fox kits are usually born in March or April, and they will be old enough to leave the den for good after about nine weeks. If Tolerance Isn’t an Option… If you cannot tolerate letting a fox family leave on their own terms, you can use mild harassment techniques that are completely humane and effective.  Try these tips from HSUS: It is often better to use multiple of these techniques in conjunction.  Please be patient, as this process can take time. A den site attractive to a fox family will most likely be attractive to other wildlife as well.  The best plan for permanent prohibition is to bury anL-shaped footerof hardware cloth around the perimeter of the area.  Remember to please make sure all the babies are out of the den before any permanent exclusion is used.","text",3

Pet Safety If you have small pets, foxes can be a danger. If your pet is bitten by a fox, take them immediately to a veterinarian.","text",5

Rabies It is very rare for a fox to be rabid.  Further, the fox strain of rabies has never been known to transmit to a human in the United States.  Remember to have all your pets vaccinated against rabies to protect them and yourself. It’s perfectly natural for a fox to be out during the day, since that’s when their prey is usually out.  A fox with rabies will exhibit symptoms such as partial paralysis, drunk-like staggering, self-mutilation, or acting unnaturally aggressive or tame.  If you exhibit these symptoms, call the police or Animal Care and Control.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/coyotes/","Coyotes Conflict Solutions When it comes down to it, hazing and securing food sources are more effective at solving coyote problems than killing. When it comes to understanding how to get rid of coyotes, you should first understand their role in the ecosystem. Coyotes play a large role in keeping rodent populations down, so while their propensity to dine on pets and livestock can be troublesome for homeowners and farmers, retaliating in an inhumane way is certainly not the answer. If a Coyote is in Your Neighborhood If you spot a coyote in your neighborhood, don’t panic. Most coyotes avoid people. Seeing a coyote out during the day is not a cause for alarm, especially in the spring and summer when they’re looking for food for their pups. If a coyote displays no fear of people, he’s probably been fed. You can reinstill his fear by raising your arms and yelling to drive him away. This is called hazing. Unlike trapping, which sometimes catches pets or other wildlife but rarely the coyotes that are causing the problems, hazing works. Coyotes may mistake small, unattended pets for prey or attack large dogs they view as threats to territory or dens. To keep your animals safe, take two simple steps: Watch your pets. Keep cats indoors, and never leave small dogs outside unsupervised or let any dog out of your yard off leash. Secure food sources. Store garbage in wildlife-proof containers and feed pets indoors. What To Know If You See or Encounter a Coyote Humane-coyote encounters, and coyote attacks are rare. An encounter with a coyote in an urban or suburban landscape is a rare event, even when coyotes are found in large numbers. Coyotes are generally nocturnal and seldom seen. You may catch a glimpse of a coyote, however, as they move from one part of their territory to another in search of prey (usually small mammals such as mice and voles). Observing a coyote in this manner (even during the daytime) does not mean that the coyote is sick or aggressive.","text",3
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/coyotes/","If the coyote is scared away by your presence, they are exhibiting natural behavior and is not cause for concern.","text",4
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/coyotes/","Habituation A coyote that does not run away when encountering humans has, most likely, become accustomed or habituated to people. This generally occurs when a coyote has been fed (in the form of handouts, pet food left outside, or unsecured garbage). Coyotes who come to depend on these sources of food may begin to approach humans looking for a handout and may begin to exhibit what’s perceived as “too tame” or aggressive behavior. When coyotes become habituated, hazing can reinstill the natural fear of humans. Hazing entails using a variety of scare techniques to teach a coyote to regard people as threatening and stay away from them. Hazing Coyotes who have lost their fear of humans should not be tolerated or enticed but instead given the clear message that they should not be so brazen. Hazing is a method that makes use of deterrents to move an animal out of an area or discourage an undesirable behavior or activity. Hazing can help maintain a coyote’s fear of humans and deter them from backyards and play spaces. Using a variety of different hazing tools is critical so that coyotes don’t get used to redundant or single stimulus devices, sounds, and actions. The simplest way of hazing a coyote involves being loud and large:","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/coyotes/","In Your Yard Remember, keeping pets and pet food inside is the best way to keep coyotes out of your yard. If you do encounter coyotes, all of the above methods can be used in your yard at home. First, try the, “Go away coyote,” method (yell and wave your arms as you approach the coyote). Here are some additional methods you can use as well: Under Porch/Deck/Stairs If a coyote needs to be evicted from one of these areas, use harassment strategies such as sweaty socks sprinkled with vinegar in the den entrance along with a blaring radio. This will take time and patience as coyotes can be resistant and will also need time to find or create a new den. One of the most effective ways to keep coyotes out of your yard is to keep it clean and to build a fence to keep them out. For example, you must keep your garbage cans secured inside, you need to keep your pets’ food inside, and you need to pick up any fallen or rotting food off the ground. To make this strategy even more effective, build a fence around your property. Fencing Fencing can be used to keep coyotes out of residential yards, but it must be at least 6feet tall and should extend underground at least 6 inches or be parallel to the ground at least 12 inches and secured with landscaping staples. Devices such as the “coyote roller,” which “rolls off” coyotes that try to scramble over the fence, can enhance the effectiveness of afence.  Do-it-yourself options also include adding PVC piping or chicken wire to the top of your fence to prevent coyotes from jumping over and retrofitting a mesh apron to the bottom of the fence (extending at least 12 inches out and secured with landscaping staples) to keep coyotes from digging under. Public Health Concerns Coyotes, like all warm-blooded animals, may contract rabies. Their close kinship to dogs places coyotes at a greater risk where there are populations of unvaccinated domestic dogs.","text",9
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/coyotes/","Recent advances in rabies control using oral bait to immunize wild animals without having to capture them have made controlling the spread of rabies in coyotes much more effective.","text",10
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/coyotes/","Other Tips for Your Property If you have a coyote in your shed, open the door and stand away from the entrance. Never try to remove a coyote yourself since it may carry rabies and could defensively attack you. Once the coyote exits, make sure all entrances to the shed have been securely closed. If you have a chicken coop, and there are coyotes in your neighborhood, you can bet one will come to investigate. In that case, install a tall fence (the taller the better!), to keep your chickens safe. Install motion-sensor lights outside of your home, garage, chicken coop, and sheds. When the lights turn on, the coyotes will be alarmed and run off. A motion sensor that triggers a sprinkler system is also a good idea. What Attracts Coyotes to Cities and Suburbs Coyotes generally avoid humans, even when their home range encompasses largely urban or suburban habitat. However, the presence of a free buffet in the form of pet food or garbage can lure coyotes into suburban yards and create the impression that backyards are bountiful feeding areas. Without the lure of food or other attractants, their visits will be brief and rare, but a coyote who finds food in one yard may learn to search for food in others. Food Deliberately feeding coyotes is a mistake. You may enjoy hand-feeding animals, but this is a surefire way to get them accustomed to people and will ultimately lead to their demise. Here are some other general rules about feeding: Shelter Coyotes are secretive animals, and studies have shown they can live for a long time in close proximity to dense human settlements without ever being noticed. Such coyotes are “abiding by the rules” and should be left alone. In the spring, when coyotes give birth and begin to raise young, they concentrate their activity around dens or burrows in which their young are sheltered. At these times, the parents may become highly defensive and territorial, and challenge any other coyote or dog that comes close to the pups.","text",11
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/coyotes/","People walking their dogs in parks or wooded areas may run into these coyotes and even be challenged by them to back off.","text",12
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/coyotes/","Rarely, fights occur, probably most often when a dog is off its leash and chases a coyote. It’s important to recognize such incidents for what they are: Defense of space and young, not random attacks. If you encounter a coyote when walking your pet, do not run away; scare off the coyote with hazing techniques. Pets Free-roaming pets, especially cats and sometimes small dogs, may attract coyotes into certain neighborhoods. The best way to minimize risk to your pets is to not leave them outside unattended. Other domestic animals kept outside, such as chickens and rabbits, may also be viewed as prey by coyotes. Protect chicken or other outdoor animals from coyotes (and other predators) with protective fencing (both structural and electrical) and by ensuring they are confined in sturdy cages or pens every evening. Coyotes typically hunt small mammals such as mice, voles, and rabbits. If given the opportunity, they will also make a meal of a cat, tame or feral. Dogs, especially smaller breeds, are also at risk, although attacks on them are rarer. The best way to protect your pets is to only let them outside when you are with them- especially at night- and to keep pet food and water inside. Protecting Feral Cat Colonies People who feed feral cats are often concerned that coyotes might prey on the cats. These concerns are well founded, as coyotes will be attracted to both the outdoor pet food and the cats themselves as prey. Here are some general suggestions for keeping cats safer:","text",13

People were coping with quarantines, and news programs were still, between the harder-hitting segments, doing cute human interest stories about at-home bread baking and socially distanced Mother’s Day visits. I remember one such story that made me a little nervous: the Pandemic Puppy.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-pandemic-puppy-what-adoption-trends-in-the-era-of-coronavirus-tell-us-about-animal-adoption/","Of course, it’s great to see animals in need going to loving homes, but I was nervous about people getting a puppy because they believed the animal would be easy to care for one while at home, or because their children were bored. I expected that some would end up returning their puppies to shelters or breeders, potentially traumatizing the animals who developed attachments that were then severed. Now that the holidays are approaching, it’s a great time to think through what this trend in puppy adoptions can teach us all about adopting a companion animal. Before you decide to pick up a pup for the family and wrap a bow around its neck, think carefully about what it means to bring an animal into your home. At the beginning of the pandemic, when people flocked to the shelters and breeders, it was inevitable that some would end upreturning their animals. Evenas late as August, the pandemic demand for dogs remained high, and around the holidays, people are prone to adopt animals even in a typical year. But, theASPCA’s adoption considerationsstill have not changed, nor have local shelters’ guidelines, pandemic or no. The ASPCA reminds us: But it’s worth noting that this impulse to adopt animals, specifically puppies, at times when we are isolated from others tells us something important about our companion animals. They are a great source of comfort to us, and dogs in particular can be excellent companions who give their families a sense of purpose as well as love and affection. Whether we are isolating at home or just feeling down because of our favorite Winter events being cancelled, having a dog around is a great source of joy and cheer. So, if you’re considering giving a dog as a gift this holiday season, thinking the lucky recipient will have plenty of time to care for the little furball while working from home, try something else.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-pandemic-puppy-what-adoption-trends-in-the-era-of-coronavirus-tell-us-about-animal-adoption/","For example, why not package up a gift bag of dog toys, blankets, and food, along with the information about a dog you’re willing to help the recipient adopt–should they want to. This way, the pup doesn’t become a surprise responsibility, and you may find that your loved one ends up with an entirely different animal, and an even better companion for their lifestyle and temperament, at the shelter or breeder’s recommendation.","text",6

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-pandemic-puppy-what-adoption-trends-in-the-era-of-coronavirus-tell-us-about-animal-adoption/","And even if you’re not gift shopping, just having a tough year and looking to give love and get some in return, consider reaching out to your local animal shelter on your own behalf.Humane Animal RescueandAnimal Friendsare both open by appointment for adoptions, and both require pre-adoption procedures like questionnaires, meet and greets, and counseling to help match you with the right animal for your lifestyle. Remember, puppies are cute, but adult and senior dogs can be just as cute, and cats are also great companions if you don’t have as much time as a dog requires. Whatever you choose, remember that companion animals are living beings joining your family. They will give you lots of joy, love, and fulfillment, and they deserve your care and respect in return.","text",8

Awful, right? That’s how my Betta fish friends were living when they were surrendered to Ahimsa Safe Haven from a grocery store. You’ve probably read or seen people talking about the cruelty of keeping fish in plastic take-out containers at pet stores, yet they’re still being sold and transported all around the globe. This story is different than many of the Betta fish accounts —it has a super sweet ending. My name is Brittany, and I have a micro-sanctuary where I house several rescued or liberated animals. Thanks to the amazing care and time that Cari from Ahimsa Safe Haven put into taking in so many surrendered Bettas (over 30!) while finding their forever homes, I was able to adopt two of the boys and transport four others to their sweet new families.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/hex-and-jinx-bettas-fresh-start-at-life/","My two new Betta residents are named Hex and Jinx. Hex is a radiant, teal colored male that loves to play in bubbles and sit on his leaf hammock. Jinx is a majestic, red colored male that adores swimming right by the filter stream and floating his way down to his mushroom house. The minute they see me walk by or sit by their tank homes, they immediately dart to my direction and stare (either waiting for food or for me to gush over them as I do several times a day). I have always loved fish, from their biology to their fascinating appearances, but I never knew how much personality they all uniquely possessed. While transporting the six Bettas from their stop at the sanctuary to my house, I worried the entire time about injuries or stress… but each time I checked on them, they were quite perky and nosy of what I was doing. When we got home and I laid them all out (still in their cups) in a heated room, they immediately started looking around and staring at one another. Hex was immediately sassy to the boys around him, puffing out to appear larger than them. Through it all, they stayed healthy and curious, ready for something new.","text",6

Her legacy will produce a ‘model humane police department’ both willing and able to help animals in need. The Lifetime Service to Animals Award is named for Senator Roy C. Afflerbach, who served as a Pennsylvania state representative and mayor of Allentown. He now dedicates himself to helping animals and was the inspiration behind forming Humane Action Pittsburgh. The retired Senator worked to overhaul a pivotal animal abuse statute that increased penalties for neglect, cruelty and aggravated cruelty.

Richard jumped right on board with HAP’s 2019 initiative, Heart of a Hero, recruiting public safety personnel to participate in a 7-day experiment that embraced a 100% whole-foods, plant-based diet. Richard knew Heart of a Hero would help the City save money on future healthcare expenses, but more importantly, he had a genuine interest in helping our emergency responders get as healthy as possible. In just one short week, the volunteers saw marked improvement in health markers, including an average drop in cholesterol of 22 points. In addition to his day job, Richard has enjoyed working as a fitness professional for nearly 40 years. He switched to eating plan-based himself after participating in Heart of a Hero.

He has been instrumental in recently reintroducing the Pet Safety and Protection Act, legislation designed to protect companion animals from illegal sale for use in laboratory experiments. The Pet Safety and Protection Act would prohibit “Class B” animal dealers from selling dogs and cats to researchers. “Class B” dealers sell abandoned or unwanted animals that they obtain from sources such as shelters, pounds, small breeders, and even free-to-a-good-home ads.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-tiger-king-exploitation-or-entertainment/","“The Tiger King” – Exploitation or Entertainment? byAimee Douglass|May 8, 2020 Across social media, it seems everyone is posting about viewing the documentary “The Tiger King” on Netflix. Released at almost the same time as orders from governors across the US to stay inside and limit or eliminate interactions with other people, the documentary was advantaged by a captive audience. It has generated numerous memes and jokes about the individuals shown, and a dissection of the craziness of their lives.​One thing that has been missing, however, at least until recently, is a discussion about the treatment of the animals by people such as Joe Exotic and others portrayed. Instead of discussing the antics of Joe, et. al., we should be discussing how these animals were treated, all in the name of providing “entertainment” to those of patronized the establishments.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/the-tiger-king-exploitation-or-entertainment/","Currently, the majority of animals housed within Joe’s facilities are now in sanctuaries, where they are free to live their lives.  If not exactly in their own natural habitats, at least they are free from further harm at the hands of the owners of the roadside zoos where they once resided. Private ownership of big cats is a unique issue within the US. There are no federal laws that prohibit owning a big cat. Currently, thirty-two states have some form of ban in place, while fourteen states allow ownership with proper licensure. Four states have no laws on the books at all. Organizations such as Big Cat Rescue, run by Carole Baskin, one of the individuals featured in the series, are pushing for all-encompassing legislation that will stem the tide of the problem of big cat ownership by individuals who most likely do not have the animals’ best interests at heart. Take Action Introduced in the House on 02/26/2019, the Big Cat Public Safety Act, H.R. 1380, seeks to revise requirements governing the trade of big cats (i.e., species of lion, tiger, leopard, cheetah, jaguar, or cougar or any hybrid of such species).  Specifically, it revises restrictions on the possession and exhibition of big cats, including to restrict direct contact between the public and big cats. The bill currently has 229 sponsors, who are listedhere. If your representative is listed, please reach out to thank them for their support of this bill. If your representative is not listed, please call and leave a polite message urging them to support this important legislation. Aimee Douglassis the Director of Compassionate Living.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/victories/pittsburgh-zoo-starting-aza-accreditation-process/","Pittsburgh Zoo Receives AZA Accreditation Following years of behind-the-scenes work by HAP leadership, on March 19, 2021, the Pittsburgh Zoo announced it was beginning the process of reinstating its AZA accreditation. In September 2024, the Zoo was approved by a unanimous vote to have its accreditation reinstated, a significant step forward in ensuring more humane treatment of animals in captivity. The Zoo ended its AZA accreditation in 2015 after disagreements with the AZA over elephant care standards, despite violating its lease with the city of Pittsburgh, which requires it to maintain AZA accreditation. Instead, the Zoo pursued accreditation from the ZAA, a weaker accreditation body that allowed unprotected contact between elephants and keepers—a dangerous practice HAP consistently opposed. Restoring the Zoo’s AZA accreditation marks a significant victory for animal welfare, raising the standard of care at the Pittsburgh Zoo. Humane Action Pittsburgh is committed to ensuring the Zoo operates at the highest standard possible for a zoo. While we recognize this as a positive step forward, we will continue to monitor their practices to safeguard the well-being of the animals.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/traveling-with-animals-and-the-planet-in-mind/","Traveling with Animals and the Planet in Mind byHannah Lewis|Jul 11, 2022 Many are calling this the summer ofrevenge travel–people have postponed, shortened, or canceled their vacations over the past two years due to Covid, and now many of us have had enough! No high gas prices or overbooked flights can keep Americans from traveling this year. But how do we continue to respect the animals we share this world with, as well as the planet itself, while we honor the wanderlust (or cabin fever) that’s driving this travel binge? There are a number of things you can consider when traveling to make your trip as animal- and planet-friendly as possible. Where to go? Most HAP followers love animals, love the planet, and want to see more of these things when we travel. I know that, for me, one of my favorite things about vacation is the opportunity to experience a different part of the natural world and encounter different wildlife. In fact, I just returned from a long weekend in the Adirondacks where my partner and I were lucky enough to share space and time with a loon atBlack Pond.","text",3

Ecotourism refers to environmentally-friendly travel. To qualify as ecotourism, “trips must involve visiting natural environments, doing nothing to change or adversely affect these areas, and providing cultural and economic advantages to local communities.” Unfortunately, though, “There’s no way to enforce these requirements…and businesses can advertise trips as ecotourism even when they aren’t environmentally responsible.” The more popular a destination becomes (take Yellowstone or Yosemite National Parks, for example), the more human visitors it attracts, the greater the danger to the vegetation, geological attractions, and–perhaps most heartbreakingly–the animals.","text",5

You might think animal attacks on bothersome tourists are totally justified and that the animals are acting for self-preservation, but that doesn’t stop them from facing grizzly consequences. Most commonly, people feed wildlife or leave food or trash unsecured in parks, on trails, and in campgrounds, which leads to crafty animals like bears eating the food, losing their fear of humans, and encountering humans when they shouldn’t.","text",7

Secure any food you pack, leave the animals alone, and never try to approach, pet, or feed any wildlife. You may think it is cute and helpful, but it is dangerous for the animals. Even leaving banana peels or apple cores on the trail can attract animals to high-traffic trails and put them in danger.","text",11

Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia all boast beautiful state and even national parks, so you don’t even have to go far to explore underappreciated wilderness and the animals we share it with. How to get there? Want to make getting to your destination better for animals and the Earth? Traveling by air or cruise ship can be swapped for train or even car travel. Obviously, cars are major polluters, andwildlife collisionsaccount for millions of animal deaths a year. Even so, a road may be a better way to travel than flying or going on a cruise. Whilecollisions between airplanes and birds do occur, the more significant problem with air travel is itshugecarbon footprint. Air travel is a major contributor to climate change, which is driving catastrophic habitat loss for animals in the air, on land, and in rivers, lakes, and the sea. While driving is better for emissions than flying (especially when multiple people drive together in the same vehicle), taking the train is thebest of all options.","text",13

Of course, there are some places it’s not practical to travel to via train or even car. Sometimes we have to fly, but to the extent that we’re able to minimize it, we’ll be doing a major service for the Earth and all who live here!","text",15

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/traveling-with-animals-and-the-planet-in-mind/","Photo byFernando JorgeonUnsplash And of course, I have to spare a moment to talk about cruise ships. Anyone who has ever taken a cruise knows how wasteful these can be. Serving after serving of food and drink are pushed on guests, ports of call are promoted as opportunities for shopping, and single-use travel-sized products abound. But thetrue environmental costof cruise ships is even greater. They present devastating threats not only to clean water but also to air quality and marine life. If you can opt for a different kind of vacation, you’ll be doing the Earth and the animals we share our oceans with a favor. Remember, at HAP, our goal is never to shame anyone for their habits or to insist that people be perfect. If your travel plans can’t be aligned with everything on this list, that’s okay! The more of these considerations you can make, the better off our world–and all the animals and even people in it–will be! The goal is progress, not perfection, so anything you can do to make a difference as you travel this year, even down to usingreef-safe vegan/cruelty-free sunscreenand remembering your reusable water bottle andreducing your plastic consumption–is a win. So as you travel this summer, enjoy your long-awaited getaway; just remember the animals.2 Aimee Douglassis the Director of Compassionate Living.

I live pretty close to my neighbors, so I didn’t want a traditional compost pile.

So I bought a compost tumbler, and it’s great for my situation.","text",7

You may be able to get rid of that compostable waste without having to wait on your compost tumbler to break down all your coffee grounds and banana peels–it just depends if you want your garden itself to be the tool you use to fight plastic waste, or if you’re happy doing that separately and not reaping the benefits directly in your garden. Plant Appropriate Produce I knew that cabbage and broccoli were best suited for cooler weather, but I planted them in mid-April anyway. You might remember we had an unseasonable cold snap or two in April, and it had me thinking that these colder-weather plants might do okay–plus I just wanted to give them a try. Well, they didn’t do okay. My broccoli went to seed right away, making it inedible, and my cabbage struggled along and wilted. If you want to grow these vegetables, plan accordingly and plant them when it’s appropriate. Otherwise, just lean into the seasonal veggies. Keep your Project Manageable One of my visions for my garden was to create a beautiful landscape of native plants to feed our lovely pollinator friends. But… that has become my plan for my garden 2.0. I want native flowering shrubs, milkweed to provide homes for monarch butterflies, coneflowers to line my walkway and provide food for bees, and even structures like bee hotels to provide much-needed habitat for bees. As excited as I am for this goal, I work full time and am involved in a few volunteer organizations, on top of finishing up a master’s degree this year. It just wasn’t realistic for me to get all that done this Spring.","text",11

However, making this an iterative process where I add layers season after season gives me something to look forward to. I started with a vision of turning my tiny little patch of earth into a space that is safe for my wild neighbors; that provides wholesome, humane, healthy food; and that helps the environment and animals to live better lives than if I had a more traditional yard. As I learn more, each year, I can move closer to that goal. I encourage you to do the same–have big aspirations, but keep your expectations for yourself manageable so that you make progress and don’t give up.","text",13

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/amhc.html","America’s Model Humane City What does the Model Humane City look like? It’s an ongoing dialogue of animal groups and civic leaders working together to create healthy citizens and communities while using the most humane practices and living peaceably with all animals in our city. Recognizing that all animals are sentient beings, capable of feeling pleasure and pain, this city- wide commitment to the humane treatment of animals will be accomplished through education, policy, and community action. Why America’s Model Humane City? In addition to leading the nation in the humane treatment of animals, HAP seeks to institute policies that protect the safety and health of our citizens, encourage thriving commerce, combat climate change, and save taxpayer dollars. Our 2020/2021 Campaigns 1.Protect Pittsburghers from Dangerous Reptiles In the past several years, Pittsburgh Animal Care and Control along with our local shelters have had to handle dozens of dangerous reptiles let loose by pet owners who no longer wanted to care for these animals. Alligators, crocodiles, and venomous snakes belong in the wild. Even in captivity, they belong in spacious facilities that can meet all their temperature, UV, dietary, and medical needs. These animals are dangerous and cannot be trained by the average individual. Red-eared slider turtles also do not make good pets. They are an invasive species and when released into the wild, compete with native species for habitat, food resources, nest sites, etc. Further, these turtles can easily carry salmonella bacteria, which can easily be transmitted to humans. Salmonella usually gives people a few miserable days of fever and diarrhea, but some end up in the hospital with life-threatening complications. Asks: Replace a well-intentioned, but inhumane and dangerous reptile ordinance passed by City Council in 2019 with the safer and more humane one proposed by Humane Action Pittsburgh and Humane Animal Rescue.","text",3
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/amhc.html","HAP’s ordinance would ban ownership of these dangerous animals, except by properly accredited institutions. This means that the Pittsburgh Zoo would NOT be exempt from this ordinance until they restore AZA accreditation. ZAA is unacceptable.","text",4
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/amhc.html","2.Restore AZA Accreditation at Pittsburgh Zoo In 2015, the Pittsburgh Zoo forfeited their AZA accreditation, which constitutes a material breach of their lease with the City of Pittsburgh. Even with several extensions, the Zoo has not come into compliance. They are accredited by the much lower ZAA, of which Barbara Baker, President and CEO of the Pittsburgh Zoo, is the Chair of the Board. This means Dr. Baker is in charge of accrediting her own organization, a clear conflict of interest. The Zoo has amassed a stack of USDA violations. Recent citations include lack of sufficient barriers between animals and the public, cockroaches in animal enclosures, using dogs to control elephants by biting and charging them, critically inappropriate handling of animals, exposing animals to dangerous and toxic chemicals, and ill-equipped staff. Clearly, the lack of a meaningful accreditation is causing harm to the animals, employees – and potentially visitors. Undercover investigations have found elephants pacing around tiny enclosures for hours, dogs close to the elephants (despite USDA citations), elephants kept indoors in conditions that could cause them foot and leg disease, dirty walls, and outdated signage claiming the Zoo is AZA accredited. These factors in addition to separating bonded elephant pairs, fighting progressive and humane Pittsburgh ordinances, and a veterinarian referring to the Zoo as a “third world jail for elephants” have earned the Pittsburgh Zoo title of In Defense of Animal’s “2019 Worst Zoo in North America for Elephants”. Asks: The City should require the Zoo comply with their lease and regain AZA accreditation. Their lease expires on December 31, 2022 and the new lease must have definitive and actionable damages for noncompliance.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/amhc.html","3.Establish Animal Protection Task Force Whether it’s a bear loose in Highland Park, alligators roaming the Southside Riverfront Trail, or hoarding farm animals in the West End, Pittsburgh has widespread and diverse animal issues that need to be dealt with by the Police. While Officer Christine Luffey and several others have done a stellar job of protecting citizens and animals alike, they cannot do it alone and without ongoing training.","text",6
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/amhc.html","Many city governments across the world have recognized that animals need their voices represented in government by establishing an Animal Task Force. These task forces identify the specific needs of animals, research best practices, dialogue with affected parties, and make policy recommendations. HAP believes Pittsburgh should replicate and improve on the model of so many cities that have created these task forces. ​Asks: 4.Humane Solutions for Pittsburgh’s Wildlife Raccoons and groundhogs are part of wild, wonderful Pennsylvania. Understandably, we don’t want these animals in our homes, but there is never an excuse for animal cruelty. Humane solutions exist. Pittsburgh has one of the most inhumane trapping and euthanasia programs in the country. Each year, thousands of animals are euthanized by Pittsburgh’s Animal Care and Control – at taxpayer expense. Trapping these animals doesn’t solve the problem and should be used only for life threatening emergencies, such as an animal in your living space. Not only would humane solutions help animals and create a lasting solution, but also save thousands of taxpayer dollars and the valuable time of our Animal Care and Control officers. ​Asks: 5.Save the Bees… Save our Planet You may have heard about the crisis facing the world’s bee population. Hundreds of species of bees are on the brink of extinction. While the precise reasons are not certain, experts believe it’s an unfortunate combination of several factors including loss of habitat, fewer food sources, and the use of pesticides. Why is this important? Bees are pollinators, and pollinators are the very backbone of the ecosystem, ensuring that the very foods we eat continue to grow. If bee populations continue to decline and collapse at the alarming rate that they have been, it could very well mean the end of humanity as we know it. And that is no exaggeration. No bees. No food. But there is something we can do.","text",7
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/amhc.html","And cities around the world are stepping up to do their part. The tasks are so simple, it’s an absolute no-brainer. And these efforts pay off. In Amsterdam, bee populations have not only stopped declining but are on the verge of recovery.","text",8

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/chipmunks/","Chipmunks Conflict Solutions Chipmunks might be one of the cutest wild animals we see in our neighborhoods.  They’re not any danger whatsoever to humans, and have never been known to cause any structural damage. Some have the misconception that chipmunks tunnel under walkways and yards to cause damage, but that is not true.  If you do see chipmunks in your yard, we suggest just leaving them alone. However, if you’re having a conflict with a chipmunk, HAP has humane, long-term solutions. Unwanted in Your Yard Sprinkle chili powder anywhere the chipmunk, or other animals, pay be frequenting or digging.  This nontoxic irritant will deter most mammals.  Vinegar-soaked rags or vinegary sprayed directly onto the area will also deter.  You can reapply daily for best results. To keep chipmunks out of your yard long-term, try these tips from the HSUS: Raiding Your Bird Feeder If you do not want chipmunks in delving into your bird feeder, try picking up spilled seeds, putting the feeders where chipmunks cannot access them, or trying a seed chipmunks do not like, such as thistle. Repellants Commercial repellants used for squirrels will also work for chipmunks. For a DIY option, try soaking bulbs before planting in a thiram-based repellant.  You can also plant daffodils (Narcissus) or Allium in the spring, as most wildlife will not eat these.","text",3

Your bird feeder may be the issue.  Birds can leave messes behind when feasting from your bird feeder and rats may see this as a delectable feast for them to enjoy. Reduce the amount of seeds that fall to the ground.  You can use a seed tray under your feeder, look for bird food that does not create a lot of waste (like shelled peanuts, sunflower hearts, suet, nectar, thistle, cracked corn, and hulled millet), and be sure to sweep up fallen seeds. Store birdseed in an air and watertight container that is rodent-proof. Place feeders as far away from your home as possible, and use baffles to prevent rats from climbing the pole. If your bird feeder is not the issue, it may be that your yard could use some tidying up.","text",5

Instead, always call a bee keeper or local professional for assistance. Some will even relocate hives and nests free of charge, and without harming them!

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/cruel-and-unusual-clothing/","Cruel and Unusual Clothing byHannah Lewis|Nov 20, 2021 To many of us, the thought of a fur coat is abhorrent. It may conjure up images of Cruella DeVil going after all those sweet little puppies–although I think it’s noteworthy that in the new origin story of that notorious fashionista femme fetalle,Cruella(2021), the directors had the sense to know that their audience would never sympathize with their antihero if sheactuallyharmed a Dalmatian.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/cruel-and-unusual-clothing/","From Disney movie rewrites to designers for celebrities likeBillie Eilish, who agreed to wear her Oscar de la Renta gown to the Met Gala only if the designer agreed to go fur-free, the signs are everywhere: people are waking up to the senselessness of fur. Even if the cultural milieu is moving away from designers who use fur, the fur industry isn’t going downwithout a fight. While the average, everyday consumer probably doesn’t have to think too hard about avoiding fur–with its exorbitant price tag in addition to the requisite animal suffering involved–fur continues to be seen as a luxury good and a status symbol for many. As we move into the holiday season, gift giving–especially for those who seem to “have everything”–can be a season of temptation for many of us to spring for something someone mightreallyappreciate–something they might not have or might not ever buy for themselves. It’s worth remembering, though, that fur isn’t the way to go–for many reasons. If knowing that animals had to die to allow that mink shawl to be created isn’t enough of a deterrent for you or a gift-seeking friend, it’s worth remembering that fur farms are some of the cruelest places for animals on the planet. As the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) explain, [F]ur farmers pack animals into unbearably small cages, preventing them from taking more than a few steps in any direction or doing anything that is natural and important to them, such as running, swimming, making nests, and finding mates… The anguish and frustration of life in a cage leads many animals to self-mutilate, biting at their skin, tail, and feet; frantically pace and circle endlessly; and even cannibalize their cagemates.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/cruel-and-unusual-clothing/","Photo byEarthbuddies Not only is this circumstance inhumane; it’s also a breeding ground for diseases, including diseases that can infect human beingssuch as Covid-19. In fact, last year, Covid-19 infections in farmed mink in Europe grew so bad thatDenmark executed millions of the animals in an effort to keep the virus from mutating and spreading back to humans–a worst-case scenario that had already played out in the Netherlands. Not only does the spread of disease in these farms endanger human lives, it also adds exponentially to the suffering the disease-riddled animals experience while they await their final cruel indignity–the execution. Execution methods for animals on fur farms are so inhumane it’s almost unbelievable, like the evil plot of a cartoon villain come to life. As PETA explains, Because fur farmers care only about preserving the quality of the fur, they use slaughter methods that keep the pelts intact but that can result in extreme suffering for the animals. Some animals even wake up while they are being skinned. Animals have clamps attached to or rods forced into their mouths and anuses, and they are painfully electrocuted… It should go without saying that the animals raised for fur–all higher-order mammals, not all that different from our own beloved dogs and cats–experience pain, suffering, and sadness. What’s more, these animals aren’t being tormented foranypurpose–there’s no medical advances coming from their suffering, no one is getting food or nourishment. They are suffering and dying on the altar of high fashion.","text",7

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/deer/","Deer Conflict Solutions One of the most beautiful creatures in the Western Pennsylvania area is certainly the deer.  That does not necessarily mean you want them in your garden or on your property. If you can’t tolerate deer in your garden, you can always try a good repellent.  If that doesn’t work, you may want to consider changing the plants in your garden or using deer-proof fencing. Repellents Our recommended repellent is to take 2 large heads of garlic halved, 2 large and strong halved onions, and simmer in 4 quarts of water for 4 hours (outside if possible).  Let cool and strain.  Then, add ½ can hot Hungarian paprika with 1 teaspoon of dish soap. Remember that a variety of repellents in combination will probably work best.  You can look for repellents that contain sulphurous odor (you know, the stuff that smells like rotten eggs) and apply them before bud-break and as new growth appears.Liquid FenceandBobbexare the most highly recommended. You can reapply repellents after heavy rains, and often (every 2 – 3 weeks).  You may want to alternate repellents so that deer don’t get used to one or the other. For applying repellents, check out these tips from HSUS:","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/deer/","Fencing If you still can’t keep deer out of your garden, try fencing.  Remember that deer can jump fences up to 8 feet high, so the 8 foot high woven wire fence is the most effective deer barrier – and it can last more than 20 years!  Local home and garden stores can help you decide what’s best for your yard. Though deer may be able to jump over electric fences, they can provide a psychological barrier for them.  Some electric fences even have a scented bait attachment to ensure that deer make contact with the fence.  They will receive a mild jolt, but should not be caused any real harm.  You can also take tin foil squares containing a bit of peanut butter to provide the same effect when folded over single or multi-strand electric fences. Remember that electric fences must be maintained with regular voltage checks.  If an electric fence is not for you, you may want to check out theHavahard 5250 Electeronic Deer Repellentthat has 3 stake-like devices and a scent lure that will give deer a mild electric shock. More Tips If deer are causing damage by rubbing against trees to remove the velvet from their antlers (a process called “back rubs”), place cylinders of hardware cloth or corrugated plastic sleeves around the tree trunks. To protect low-growing plants or vegetables, drape mesh, chicken wire, or hardware cloth.  Please don’t use netting or birds may get caught. If you have specific trees or shrubs that you won’t to protect, hang a bar of Irish Spring on them. Motion-activated sprinklers (like theScarecroworHavahart) may startle deer, and when used in conjunction with other tips found on this page can be very effective.  The Deer Shield Electronic Deer Guard is another device you may want to try.  It lets out digital recordings of alarmed and territorial deer that may incentivize the real deer to go elsewhere. Are Deer Overpopulated?","text",7
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/deer/","As suburban sprawl has increased, humans have been taking over the deer’s habitat.  One might think there are too many deer around, but most problems are completely unrelated to the greater population’s numbers.  If a deer is eating your plants, it is not indicative of a population problem – it’s indicative of one, or a few, specific deer that enjoy eating plants.","text",8
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/deer/","Deer culling, or deer killing, is at best a short-term, inhumane, and ineffective approach.  The root cause of the issue must be addressed before deer (or any wildlife) conflicts can be solved in the long-term.  To learn more on why killing doesn’t work, check out the HSUS Wild Neighborswebsite.","text",9

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/crows/","Crows Conflict Solutions Crows are very social and intelligent animals. The groups of crows in your backyard are extended families who share food and look out for each other, like many of our own families. Some young crows help their parents care for younger siblings before breeding themselves. Crows work together to mob a threatening predator or another crow attempting to move in on the group’s territory. A crow family can eat 40,000 grubs, caterpillars, armyworms and other insects in one nesting season. That is an immense amount of insects that many gardeners and farmers consider pests. These good environmental citizens also transport and store seeds, thus contributing to forest renewal. And their habit of eating carrion makes them part of nature’s cleanup crew. What attracts crows to urban areas? American crows use almost any combination of woodland, farmland, orchard or suburban neighborhood. Like other common urban wild neighbors, they thrive in the habitat we create. Crows increased and spread when Europeans colonized North America. As agriculture and urbanization spread, so did crows. Crows’ sociability can be hard on human neighbors where large winter roosts form in cities and towns. Crows from colder places migrate to join crows who live near the roost year-round. Communal roosts offer protection. But the noise and mess of a large winter roost in town make for hard feelings among human neighbors. Fortunately, these conflicts can be resolved humanely. Common conflicts and solutions For all conflicts with crows, making the area where they are unwelcome less attractive to them will help. Trash, food waste in open compost, pet food and food put out for other wild species are all attractive to crows. Especially important: Keep crows out of food sources. Crows in Trash Keeping crows out of trash is easy: Consistently use intact and secure trash containers with tight-fitting lids.","text",3
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/crows/","Trash bags or overfilled bins will invariably attract crows, who easily open the bags to retrieve what they want.","text",4
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/crows/","Crows visit trash by day; trash that is scattered overnight is the work of others—dogs or, perhaps, raccoons—but may be unjustly blamed on the crows who the homeowner sees in the morning eating the leftovers after the real culprits are gone. No matter who gets in the trash, simply putting lids on is enough to keep out crows.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/crows/","Large Winter Roosts Crows began abandoning rural roosts for towns and cities in the 1960s. Now many crows commute to the country, visiting cornfields and pastures to forage by day before returning in late afternoon to urban roosts. Some crow roosts formed at the edge of urban areas for years and has been simply engulfed by spreading development. But that’s not the case for all roosts. Some towns have been adopted by large crow roosts, even some old downtown areas. Why have crows made this shift? Mainly because we create excellent crow habitat with ample food nearby. Other factors that may contribute: The same roost locations have been used for decades or longer. One in New York has been used for over 125 years. Roosts can host from a few hundred birds to hundreds of thousands. Crows form large roosts in late fall and stay until early spring when they return to their breeding territories. These winter roosts can be especially large in places where northern migrants augment local crow populations. Northern locations in the United States and Canada may have large roosts only in the summer and fall because these birds migrate south for the winter. There are some year-round roosts in California. People complain about the mess and noise around urban roosts. Droppings on walkways and vehicles are an aggravation. The crows’ loud cawing and calling at roosts tend to be noisiest right before dawn—even on weekends. Humane harassment can move crows who roost in undesirable locations. The jury is still out on when this works best, but we feel it is when roosts are just beginning to form for the season, before crows are well settled in. Roosts are also easier to relocate when they are just being established at a new location—before the crows have spent many seasons using the same spot. So, start as soon as it’s clear there’s going to be a conflict. Successful programs combine techniques.","text",7
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/crows/","Used together, each of these techniques reinforce the others to convince crows the roost location is unsafe:","text",8
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/crows/","One community moved a neighborhood roost by just having people out on the sidewalks with noisemakers at dusk for the better part of a week. Apparently, the crows did not like the party-going human neighbors every night. Reducing outdoor lighting may make the area less attractive to crows. Turn off outdoor lights, use lights aimed towards the ground, or use a motion-trigger that only turns on lights when someone enters the area. While recognizing the value of mature trees, selective thinning and pruning trees can reduce crow use. Pushed from their roost, crows generally move to the nearest similar site. There will still be crows in the community, just not in the objectionable roost location. Allow the crows a roost site with a stand of tall trees in the same general area as the site where they are unwelcome and do not harass them there so they will leave a problem site more readily.","text",9

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/crows/","Crows in Gardens Crows are sometimes blamed for garden damage caused by other animals. Crows hanging around to eat insects and grubs may or may not also help themselves to fruits and vegetables. On balance, the benefits from crows eating insects, grubs and waste grain may outweigh a little damage. You can ban crows from small gardens. As long as crows have enjoyed our tasty crops and produce, we have been trying to frighten them away. What have we learned? Competition with Other Backyard Birds Food put out to attract songbirds will also be attractive to crows. Backyard bird feeders who want to attract only smaller birds can simply use feeders that exclude larger birds.","text",11

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/crows/","Why Poison is not the Answer A few communities looking for a quick fix to crow roost nuisance killed crows with slow-acting poison DRC-1339. Killing crows doesn’t cause the survivors to leave town. It merely allows more of the next season’s young to survive due to less competition for resources. Changes in crow numbers are very short term. Additionally, underOrdinance No. 36that HAP helped passed, it is illegal in Pittsburgh to harm any wild bird. As such, it is strictly prohibited in the City of Pittsburgh to use poison or other inhumane methods. DRC-1339 kills by damaging the kidney and heart. Poisoned birds die slowly over about one to three days. It is inhumane to the crows, who are killed merely for being inconvenient. And the poison may sicken or kill other animals (called non-target animals). Crows hide food for later. Any animal can find and eat these caches, not just crows. Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was one such community that reached for a quick fix. Local people and bird lovers nationally voiced their strong objections to poisoning crows. Penn State researchers looked at what happened after the poisoning and found that it did not work. Local officials abandoned plans to poison again the next year and worked with local crow lovers to start a humane harassment program instead. Volunteers from the ranks of local people who condemned the poisoning assist with the seasonal harassment work. In its first season, the program successfully moved the large downtown roost from its prior problematic site. The crows shifted to a more industrial area; a less problematic site. By the end of its second season, the program moved crows out of most of the city to roosts outside Lancaster.

I would choose the zoo over Kennywood any day, because as far as I was concerned, it was much more interesting. As the zoo added new animals and exhibits, I would beg to go, and sometimes my begging would work, although no one else in my family seemed as enthusiastic as me. As an adult, I still loved going to the zoo, and would drag my husband there at least once a year.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/pittsburgh-zoo-and-ppg-aquarium-good-stewards-for-animals/","​When I went vegan 8 ½ years ago, I struggled with the idea of zoos. On the one hand, they professed to be helping in conservation efforts, but on the other hand they were taking animals out of their natural habitat in order to entertain humans, when sanctuaries and wildlife preserves could provide the same, and sometimes even better interaction with animals rather than seeing them caged in unnatural habitats designed to mimic their real homes. It made me angry. However, I eventually came to peace with the idea that zoos would exist, and they would not disappear overnight, and comforted myself with the knowledge that most were good caretakers with genuine interest in animals, and the bad zoos would be found and shut down in no time. The Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium fell into the category of good caretakers because I would constantly hear about the accreditations and the measures they took to keep their animals healthy and safe, and even contribute to conservation efforts. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case when it comes to the Pittsburgh Zoo. Since 2015, the zoo has been in violation of its lease agreement with the City of Pittsburgh, as it has not maintained the level of accreditation as outlined in theleasefor the zoo itself. Accreditation is not something to take lightly, as the measures outlined create uniform requirements and provisions for the overall protection of all animals. There are two major accrediting bodies that apply to zoos (other than the USDA) and they vary greatly in their requirements as noted below and listed in the following table. ​Accreditation by the Association of Zoos & Aquariums (AZA) ensures that highly qualified, knowledgeable, and experienced professionals provide care for animals in a safe and secure environment at modern facilities.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/pittsburgh-zoo-and-ppg-aquarium-good-stewards-for-animals/","In contrast, the deceptively named Zoological Association of America (ZAA) has weak standards, accredits poorly run roadside zoos and private menageries, and promotes the private ownership of exotic pets and the commercialization of wildlife. The comparison chart below illustrates a few of the many important differences between the two organizations. (Humane Society of the United States)","text",6

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/pittsburgh-zoo-and-ppg-aquarium-good-stewards-for-animals/","The Pittsburgh Zoo was a long-time member of the AZA until it decided to drop the accreditation for the ZAA after issues with the care of the elephants in the zoo were pointed out. The Pittsburgh Zoo has consistently beencalled outfor its subpar treatment of elephants, even as recently as January of this year. The zoo has also had multiple violations noted by the USDA regarding their treatment of elephants in both the zoo and its affiliated elephant breeding facility located in Somerset, PA. In addition, as the City of Pittsburgh discussed and eventually passed the Bullhook Ban in 2017, the zoo sent multiple employees to City Council hearings to stress the fact that the ban would endanger their lives – statements that were not backed up by the prevalent research into the use of bullhooks, and the zoo claims they do not use the bullhooks on their elephants, which would clearly violate the ordinance. Rather than correct the issues regarding their elephants, the zoo decided to adhere to the lesser provisions of the ZAA instead. As noted, the ZAA accreditation designation is inviolation of the zoo’s leasewith the City. ​On top of this, Barbara Baker, the zoo’s President and CEO, is also the head of ZAA, which presents a clear conflict of interest – how can one trust her decisions when she is the head of the agency accrediting her own organization? If you are a resident of the City of Pittsburgh and care about having a zoo that adheres to the most basic and beneficial standards of care, please reach out to City Council and urge members to ensure that the zoo adheres to the agreement of its lease with the City. As a non-profit that benefits from the use of free water and sewage, services that residents pay for, the Pittsburgh Zoo should provide the best care to the animals in its facilities, and citizens should demand as such.","text",8

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/squirrels-conflict-solutions/","Squirrels may eat flowers and trees, dig holes in lawns, and even chew on wooden decks and furniture. Squirrels are only active during the day, so you should be able to catch a squirrel in the act to ensure you have the right culprit. Trees Small fruit and nut tree can be protected by squirrels by netting the entire tree for a short period when squirrel damage is most likely to occur. Fruit trees may be protected by wrapping a two-foot band of sheet metal around the trust about six feet off the ground as long as the squirrels cannot jump on them from adjoining trees. Do not leave the bands on any longer than necessary, since insect damage might occur and the trunks of sensitive trees may get sun scald if bands are removed after a long time. Flower Bulbs Squirrels will dig up and eat tulip and crocus bulbs, but they do not like daffodils, so consider investing in plants squirrels do not favor. You may also soak bulbs in a repellent with Thiram as the active ingredient before planting. Lay chicken wire over the planing or use wire bulb cages. Lawns If you have tiny holes in your yard about the size of a quarter, they are most likely the sign of squirrel activity. Squirrels bury their winter food supply and rely on their sense of smell to relocate it. Any “damage” they create from this is likely to be slight, so we suggest tolerating it. The lawn will heal itself by spring. Wood Decks and Furniture If squirrels are gnawing on deck railings or wooden lawn furniture, try capsaicin-based repellents or lightly rubbing the exposed surfaces with a bar of soap. Please use caution with capsaicin, as it can be transferred to your hands and cause intense irritation if it gets into your eyes. Bird Feeders Squirrels can jump over ten feet, so place feeders far away from trees, wire, porches, gutters, and other launching points to make it more difficult for them to get to your feeders.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/squirrels-conflict-solutions/","You can also place a wire cage around a bird feeder that a squirrel could not fit through but smaller birds may. This also can help prevent larger bully birds from accessing the feeder.","text",6
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/squirrels-conflict-solutions/","Installing a baffle can prevent squirrels from reaching your bird feeders. You can buy baffles or create your own setup, as follows: There are also many new bird feeder designs that can prevent squirrels from successfully feeding, so finding a more advanced model may help. For example, some have openings that close when any animal as heavy as a squirrel tries to reach the entrance. Another approach is to fill your feeder with foods that squirrels do not want, such as safflower seed, nyjer thistle, or a birdseed mixture that includes a large amount of white proso millet seed. Additionally, squirrels are sensitive to the perceived heat of pepper, while birds are not. Adding cayenne pepper or similar spices to birdseed can deter squirrels. However, cayenne can be washed off and must be used consistently for the best results. Finally, keep the area around your feeder clean and remove debris and spilled seed from the ground that may attract squirrels. This also ensures that ground-feeding birds do not eat old, contaminated, or rotting seed that could harm them.","text",7

If you are unsure if the squirrel has left, stuff holes with newspaper, and if the newspaper stays in place for three days, the squirrel has moved and it is safe to repair holes. Attics Squirrels living in attics is concerning because squirrels may gnaw on boards and electrical wires. The most serious problems generally come from nesting adult females who will build their nest near openings, such as unscreened vents or loose or rotten trim boards. To deal with squirrels in your attic, do the following: Chimneys Sometimes squirrels enter chimneys and are unable to climb back out, which forces them into a fireplace or basement duct. Assume that any squirrel in a chimney is trapped, unless you have clear evidence that they are able to climb back out on their own. For any trapped squirrels, do the following:","text",9

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/starlings-conflict-solutions/","Prevention is Key If you can prevent starlings from building a nest somewhere unwanted, that is the best possible solution.  Seal any openings or cavities, and feel free to remove nests you may find – as long as eggs or babies are not there. For sealing openings, use hardware cloth, metal flashing, orcommercial vent covers.  Keep in mind that lighter material like plastic netting or window screening typically doesn’t work.  Make sure to check your seals and covers periodically! If Nesting Has Already Occurred Remove the nesting material immediately if babies or eggs are not present.  If eggs or young are already in the nest, please wait until they leave and then remove the nesting material.  Note that you may have to wait about 12 days for eggs to hatch and up to 3 weeks for the young to leave the nest.  Once the babies have left and you’ve removed the nesting material, don’t forget to seal the opening. If it isn’t possible to wait to remove the nest until babies leave on their own, it is possible that the parents can still raise their young elsewhere.  Please follow these tips from HSUS: Noisy nestlings usually attract the parents who will continue to care for them. Watch the substitute nest to see that the adults return. They should not take more than a half hour or so, as growing young birds need constant feeding. If the adults do not return to nestlings, contact awildlife rehabilitatorin your area for advice. Finally and importantly, if it was a vent that you vacated, promptly install a vent cover to keep other starlings, and other birds, out. Note thatsubstitute nests won’t work with eggs.Please leave the birds to complete the cycle for this one nesting period.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/starlings-conflict-solutions/","In Your Yard Leave them alone!  Starlings clean insects up in the grass and are actually performing a service. In Public Places Killing birds does not work as a long term solution to population control.  If starlings make their way into a warehouse or shopping mall, try bird-proofing entry points by using strip doors or curtains or overlapping flexible strips. If the birds are already inside, they can be removed humanely with nets or live-traps, and then released outside.  Keep in mind this is a short-term solution, and bird-proofing the entry points as described above is the best way to solve the problem long-term, in addition to ensuring open trash and leftover food are not around.","text",7

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/raccoon-conflict-solutions","Believe it or not, most conflicts with raccoons are the fault of humans.  While it may not be purposeful, our gardens, birdfeeders, and trash can lure these cute creatures into our gardens and property. If you do have a conflict with a raccoon, please avoid calling Animal Care and Control, or a pest control company.State laws often mandate that these animals be killed when trapped, and trapping is not a long-term solution for wildlife conflicts. Common means of killing by wildlife control companies are injecting acetone into the animal’s chest with a syringe and drowning, both very inhumane and unnecessary. Before you call Animal Care and Control or a wildlife control company, try these effective, inexpensive, and humane solutions.  Remember, trapping these animalsdoesn’t workand by state law, when Animal Control or pest control companies trap them, they must be killed. We can caution website readers to avoid body grip traps and paw hold traps, as these types of traps are inhumane and result in the raccoon’s death. FromCritter Control: “Prevent raccoons by installing chimney caps, pruning trees, fencing the garden, removing food, securing the garbage, and keeping pets secure. Raccoons have the same three basic needs for survival: food, water, and shelter. Your home provides many opportunities for each. Removing or limiting access to food, water, and shelter can help deter a raccoon infestation.”","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/raccoon-conflict-solutions","Are you sure it’s a raccoon? Before you do anything, make sure you’re dealing with a raccoon and not a neighbor’s dog or community cat. Check for some of the following signs, as suggested by the Humane Society of the United States: Raccoon Inside Your House Make sure you understand how the raccoons entered your home in the first place.  Give your house a thorough inspection to find areas where raccoons could get in by viewing your house from the perspective of an animal looking for a den. Are raccoons actually there? To determine if an opening is being used, block the hole loosely with wadded newspaper. Leave in place for two to three days.  If the newspaper goes undisturbed, and the weather has not been particularly cold or stormy, no one is using it as an entryway. If the newspaper is pushed out of place, someone has moved in. Once you’ve found how they’re getting in, determine if you’re dealing with a mom and babies.  If so, please wait a few weeks until the babies grow old enough to leave with their mother – they won’t survive without her! Don’t try to trap and relocate the family yourself – it will almost always lead to separation and death of the babies, unless done by a professional. Denning In Your Attic Care should be taken when using harassment during the breeding season, which is March through October. Leave all lights on, rock music blaring, and vinegar-doused rags around the attic. Apply deterrents just before nightfall, andbe patient—  it may take a few days. Once ALL animals are gone, seal entry holes. You can stuff holes with newspapers for three to make sure all the animals are gone. Denning In Your Chimney Keep the damper closed and put blaring rock music on the radio in the fireplace with a bowl of cider vinegar.  Again, make sure to do this just before nightfall. Note: You may want to have the flue cleaned and a chimney cap installed once the raccoons are evicted.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/raccoon-conflict-solutions","Under Your Porch/Deck/Stairs If this is spring or summer, the raccoon is probably a mom with babies.  If you can tolerate them being there until they move out on their own, please do.  If not, harassment techniques like socks with cider vinegar, bright lights at night, and blaring rock music might help them move along.","text",6
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/raccoon-conflict-solutions","One-way doors or anL-shaped barrierwill prevent future denning, but please make sure non-babies are left behind first! In Your Walls or Ceilings When raccoons are in these difficult to access places, you should hire a professional to search for young, and then use humane harassment techniques (like blaring rock music and cider vinegar) to encourage the adult to leave. In Your Ducts and Crawl Spaces If a raccoon is trapped in your ducts or crawl spaces, this will probably require a professional for humane removal.","text",7

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/raccoon-conflict-solutions","In Your Yard While generally a short-term problem, if you do not want raccoons in your yard, try a hot sauce (capsaicin) repellent on small areas.  For larger areas, try a repellent around the perimeter, lights left on at night, or sprinklers. Eating Your Garden Try to act quickly!  Try blaring rock music and lights for a few nights by your crops, or single-strand electric fencing around areas where damage is frequent. Pond Raccoons may eat fish, frogs, or other aquatic life and then tear up plants while searching for food.  Try creating hiding places for fish and frogs by stacking holed cinder blocks next to each other in groups of three or four and piling rocks or sinking sections of ceramic tile. If safe for your pond and home, you can put single-strand electric fencing around the pond from 4 – 8” off the ground. In Your Trash When raccoons get into the trash, it’s not a raccoon problem; it’s a trash problem. Bird Feeder Issues If raccoons are eating your birdseed, try one or some of the following tips: Interacting With Your Pets The most common reason raccoons come into contact with your pets is from feeding them outside. By feeding pets inside, most conflicts can be avoided.  You should also always supervise dogs when outside, and keep them on a leash or tether to avoid your dog chasing a raccoon and keep pet cats and rabbits inside. If raccoons are coming in through your pet door, make sure to keep your pet door locked at night and use one that only opens upon receiving a signal from your pet’s electronic collar.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/raccoon-conflict-solutions","General Deterrents Scatter or spray pepper Spices like cinnamon, black pepper or cayenne pepper bother a raccoon’s sense of smell, forcing it to relocate to a more livable area. By mixing cayenne pepper and onion in boiling water, you can create a natural raccoon repellant. You can add hot sauce to the mixture, as well. To be effective, you’ll need to spray your yard and house baseline at least twice a week and any time it rains. Soak rags in ammonia Ammonia is another thing raccoons hate the smell of, so you can deter raccoons by placing it around your property. You can soak rags in ammonia and place them under your house, in the bottom of garbage cans and at the bottom of trees in your yard. You can also fill bowls with ammonia and place those accordingly.","text",11

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/raccoon-conflict-solutions","Rabies and Other HealthConcerns According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only one human has ever died from the raccoon strain of rabies. A rabid raccoon is usually dead within 1-3 days of becoming infectious, and even if you’re bitten by a rabid raccoon, effective post-exposure treatment is available. Is the Raccoon Rabid? Remember that just because you see a raccoon during the daydoes not mean they are sick or dangerous.The raccoon is probably just a mom looking for food for her babies. Before calling for help, look for: If you see a raccoon showing these signs, call Animal Care and Control.  Remember that in doing so, the raccoon will be trapped and killed.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/vegan-on-a-budget/","Photo byImants KaziļunsonUnsplash This year, many Americans are struggling to adjust their food budgets as inflation raises prices on many everyday staples at the grocery story. Since veganism already has a reputation among many as an expensive lifestyle, recent price increases at the grocery store may have many vegan-curious people wondering if this is the right time to make what they see as this costly switch. However, I have been a bit baffled that as stories about runaway inflation at the grocery store surface, I have seen very little impact on my grocery bill. For my household of 2, our weekly food budget remains in the $70-$100 range every week. While my partner is an omnivore, the vast majority of the meals we eat at home are vegetarian, and many are vegan, made up of plant-based whole foods. For many, a vegan diet may actually be a great way to reduce their grocery bill. Even skipping meat and eating just a few more vegan meals at home can go a long way to cut costs while reducing the carbon footprint of your meals and, of course, protecting scores of cows, chickens, and pigs from cruel, inhumane conditions and untimely deaths. It may seem daunting for some to try veganism on a budget, but these tips will get you started.Please keep in mind that this is general advice; please tailor it to your own health needs, preferences, and lifestyle.If you have any unique health needs (e.g. soy, peanut, or other food allergies, gluten intolerance, vitamin deficiencies, heavier-than-average protein needs, etc), a vegan diet can still absolutely work for you, but I would recommend touching base with a medical professional to ensure you are eating a balanced diet for your individual needs–and that doesn’t just go for the vegan-curious, but anyone with unique health needs with any kind of diet.) 1. Cook your meals at home","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/vegan-on-a-budget/","Photo byJason BriscoeonUnsplash By far the most significant way that anyone can help to reduce their food budget is by cooking at home. It may be tempting to think of fast food meals as a bargain–after all, you don’t even have to do any dishes–but the truth is that the cost to make higher quality meals at home can bemuchlower. When it comes to vegan meals, this can be especially true. To get a really healthy, well-balanced vegan meal at a restaurant will cost you significantly more than making the same or similar food at home, so this is a great place to start. If you’re a novice cook, I recommend finding just a few recipes that you want to master and getting those down. And if your diet was heavily meat-based before, you might want to try meals that will satisfy the same cravings. It’s really easy (and cheap!) to make veggie burgers at home, for example. Many pasta dishes are vegan by default and are very easy to cook, and you can use beans in place of meat for taco Tuesdays or to replicate almost any mexican dish. 2. Find alternative ways to “treat yourself”","text",7

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/vegan-on-a-budget/","Photo byMatt HoffmanonUnsplash One mistake many people make when trying a new diet or lifestyle and/or when trying to reduce their spending is to forego all pleasures. Just because you can’t stop at Starbucks for your latte every day doesn’t mean you don’t deserve a treat. And it’s definitely manageable to sneak in a couple of Starbucks trips without breaking your budget–they have plenty of vegan options for almost anything!–but those kinds of costs add up if you’re indulging on a daily basis. Instead, find a way to scratch that itch with something homemade. For example, once I started making myown cold brew coffee, I’ve really embraced it. And you can find recipes that replicate your favorite snacks, likethese pumpkin scones, too. An added bonus? Making your favorite treats at homedrasticallyreduces the amount of trash you’re contributing to landfills. 3. Embrace world cuisine","text",9

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/vegan-on-a-budget/","Photo byDragne MariusonUnsplash Another common mistake many people make when trying to add more vegan meals to their menu can be to try to replicate a fairly standard Western meal–meat, starch, vegetables. Trying to come up with a vegan alternative to a roast or a steak will inevitably lead to spending on Impossible or Beyond products or other vegan meat substitutes, which can be expensive. Think about it: millions ofpeople in Indiaare vegetarian. TheChinese invented tofuthousands of years ago. And in many parts of the world where plants were a more readily-available source of calories than animals (basically everywhere with a reasonable growing season), meat was a rare addition rather than an integral ingredient in meals. It can be easy to think of rice and beans as boring and sad, but if you learn to cook like the cultures who have used these ingredients as staples for centuries, you’ll discover that even humble ingredients can be delicious. 4. Buy ingredients, not prepared meals","text",11

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/vegan-on-a-budget/","Photo byNo RevisionsonUnsplash When you shop, try to avoid those tempting veganized frozen Orange “Chicken” dinners at Trader Joe’s and instead opt for ingredients like tofu, beans, legumes, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. A few frozen meals here and there are a good way to stop yourself from buying take out, but your daily meals should really come from plant-based whole foods if you want to maximize the health of your diet as well as the affordability. Instead of buying expensive meat replacements or frozen meals, invest that money in really rounding out your pantry. Spices, oils, and vinegars can all be kind of expensive up-front, so buying a few per shopping trip makes more sense than buying them all at once. But don’t skimp entirely. Using the right oil or vinegar for a dish goes a long way, but especially learning toreallyseason your meals is what will make them a real joy to eat. 5. Explore frozen, canned, and dried options","text",13

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/vegan-on-a-budget/","Photo byDevin RajaramonUnsplash Since you’ll be buying lots of fruits and vegetables, you really want to think about how to do that effectively not only for your budget but also for your shopping habits. Some fruits and vegetables can get wilty, soft, or overripe pretty quickly, so unless you are comfortable splitting up your shopping into multiple trips a week, I highly recommend leaning on shelf-stable and frozen fruits and vegetables. For your fresh produce, try shopping for what is in season, since out-of-season foods usually have to be transported from far away, decreasing their shelf life (and increasing their carbon footprint). For out of season produce (like berries in the winter), consider if and when you can go ahead and opt for frozen, canned, or even dried varieties. Just be sure to read the labels–you want to avoid anything with a lot of added sugar or preservatives. 6. Find food blogs you love Nothing will make you want to cook at home more than a food blog or food YouTuber you love. Once you’ve mastered a few basic meals, they will start to get old quickly if you don’t introduce more variety into your menus. You may even use these blogs as the source for your inspiration for those basic meals. I recommendMinimalist Baker. I probably make a recipe from this site every week. And while they’re not exclusively vegan,Budget BytesandCookie and Katehavea lotof vegan recipes or recipes that can easily be made vegan with a few adjustments. My partner, who isn’t as avid a home cook, really likesPiping Hot Currybecause of the number of Instant Pot meals available there. And if none of these appeal to you, keep an eye on the HAP newsletter (sign uphereif you’re not on the mailing list already) or our Social pages–we share easy and tasty vegan recipes regularly. 7.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/vegan-on-a-budget/","Photo by2H MediaonUnsplash When you have a plan for the week, it’s much easier to avoid the urge to go for that vegan sofritas bowl at Chipotle. When you plan your meals, look at your week first. Are there evenings when you have appointments or plans with friends? Make sure you don’t have to cook those nights–plan for leftovers. Do you have a big project at work coming up that will make cooking a burden? Use the week before to make meals that freeze well (soups, curries, and casseroles all work really well). Stock your freezer and you can limit the time you spend in the kitchen on those busy, stressful days. And you’ll come to find that having those meals planned and having leftovers available actually makes ordering takeout undesirable–someone has to go pick it up, or else you have to pay a delivery fee that costs as much as the ingredients to make the meal in the first place. And you don’t have to deal with the decision fatigue that comes with trying to pick a place to order from that everyone will like or the disappointment when you find a restaurant has only a handful of vegan options available. 8.

But once you’ve done that, it’s helpful to have a few easy recipes in your back pocket that can use up leftovers. Vegan bread pudding or bread crumbs use up those stale pieces and bread ends you might be left with at the end of the week. Stir fries are a great way to use up veggies, or sheet pan mealslike this one. Overripe bananas or avocados can be prepared and frozen to use in smoothies or baking. 9. Shop around This tip can be a bit of a hassle, so try it out and evaluate for yourself if the savings are worth your time. For me, it definitely can be, especially when buying items like spices and oils that can get expensive. Shopping around can really go a long way in reducing your grocery bills. Places like Whole Foods are almost guaranteed to have anything you might have on your grocery list, but a more budget-friendly option like Aldi will also have a lot of it. Nowadays, it’s easy to see what’s in stock before you go shopping, so you can plan your trips accordingly.","text",19

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/vegan-on-a-budget/","Photo byCalum LewisonUnsplash Probably the most under-rated hack is to visit ethnic grocers,especiallyfor those spices. There’s a great Asian market near me onMcKnight Road, as well as a greatIndian Grocerwe’ve visited in Oakland, and these are just a couple of the options in and around Pittsburgh. Since we’ve been using curbside pickup and trying to limit our trips out during the Omicron surge, we haven’t been to these stores recently, and it makes a big difference. For example, there’s some garam masala on the grocery list below. This is a super common Indian spice. After shopping around, I found iton Amazon(and WholeFoods) in a small container for over $6.00, around $3.33/ounce. The Indian grocer would have a big pouch of it for under $2.00. These stores are also excellent places for bargains on rice and various beans, lentils, and legumes, plus sauces, oils, and seasonings. And they can be a great place, once you find youreallylove cooking, to find ingredients that inspire you to try new and unique recipes. Plus you’re supporting small businesses. If you’re not ready to add a trip into an ethnic grocer after already stopping at one or even two other stores that week, no problem. You can also shop around at a single store like Giant Eagle just by trying the store brands, which are significantly cheaper than name brand products but can cost half as much or even less. Stores like Trader Joe’s and Aldi usually don’t carry name brand products, so shopping primarily at these stores can mean instant bargains, but I still recommend shopping around at least a little bit. 10. Ensure balance The hidden cost of a standard American diet loaded with meat products isn’t felt at the checkout. Diets high in red meat and dairy can be significantly out of balance, and too many prepared meals can mean lots of sodium and preservatives.","text",21

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/vegan-on-a-budget/","Photo byAtomsonUnsplash It’s vital to remember that this benefit comes with abalancedvegan diet. If you decide to forego meat and dairy and instead opt for tons of potatoes, meat alternatives, processed grains, and lean on sugar, salt, and oil for flavor, you will probably still have the same health outcomes as you would have without making the switch, so be sure you are eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, legumes, beans, and whole-grains to get the most out of your meals. Bonus Pro-Tips: Once you’ve mastered these steps, you can move on to the expert level and try these to cut your budget even more by doing things like baking from scratch (which would have saved me about $10 on this week’s batch of bread), starting a garden (which would save me another $10 on fresh herbs), and making your own staples like pant milk, vegan mayonnaise, thisegg alternative, or your own salad dressings. You can swap out canned beans and legumes for dried ones for an extra few bucks in savings each month, too. Below is an example of a shopping list and meal plan for 2. This is a fairly typical meal plan for me and my partner and it meets our dietary needs fairly well. However, everyone is different–an athlete may need more calories and more protein, for example, while someone with gluten sensitivity may need to avoid grains listed.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/snakes-conflict-solutions/","Snakes Conflict Solutions Many people are deeply afraid of snakes, causing them to often be villainized. While snakes can cause a few problems for landowners, they are mostly tolerable. Some larger species of snakes may cause problems with chicken coops, but aside from venomous snake species, snakes are not a threat to humans or their pets.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/snakes-conflict-solutions/","Encounters with Snakes Most encounters with snakes are done in passing. However, if you do encounter a snake, be sure to: leave the snake alone, identify it by species; and continue to leave it alone so long as it is not venomous and not inside a house or building. All outdoor encounters withnonvenomous snakesshould be resolved by letting the animal go its own way, most likely to never be seen again. However, all encounters withvenomous snakesshould be taken seriously. The snake should be removed to ensure that no one gets hurt. In most areas, you can call animal control or local police or fire departments to remove the snake. However, we would urge you to contactHumane Animal Rescue of Pittsburghto provide the snake with the best chance of survival. Moving snakes to unfamiliar territory may compromise their chances of survival, so it must be done with the utmost care. Exclusion Excluding snakes from buildings can be difficult, and keeping snakes out of yards or gardens may be impossible. Snakes in houses may be there either accidentally or purposely to find prey or shelter. They can become trapped inside and may die from lack of food or moisture if not captured and removed. Reducing the chance of a snake moving into your yard can be done so by making your yard less attractive to snakes:","text",5

As such, placing a heating pad or even a pile of burlap or other material on the basement floor may attract the snake so you can then trap it. If you are not afraid of snakes and believe you can do so without harming yourself or the snake (make sure it is a nonvenomous species!), you can consider putting on gloves, gently picking up the snake, and carefully relocating it outside.","text",7

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/snakes-conflict-solutions/","Snake-Proofing Your Property Snakes usually enter buildings at ground level, some fitting through tiny cracks or holes no more than one-eight inch wide. Closely inspect the foundation of your building for unsealed wire or pipe conduits or basement windows or doors that do not seal tightly and seal these openings immediately. Some snakes are also good climbers, so tree shrubs, stone walls, or chimneys may provide access to the roof. Be sure to check for openings around the eaves and roof. Inspect behind concrete porches, steps, and where decks attach to your house. If you have had snakes in your property, try to identify which opening is likely the main snake entrance. Seal all openings except the suspected main entrance. On that opening, install a one-way door for snakes, as follows: Please note, Humane Action Pittsburgh (HAP) is not a wildlife rescue and is unable to address concerns or assist with wildlife emergencies.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/covid-19-bear-bile-and-the-bear-act/","COVID-19, Bear Bile, and the Bear Act byAimee Douglass|Apr 14, 2020 “We’ve got to leave behind the whole set of archaic, inhumane practices where we treat wildlife as potluck or potion, as textiles or trinkets in the making. The COVID-19 crisis is an air-siren to be heard and heeded throughout the world, including for the protection of wildlife” –Wayne Pacelle As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect daily life across the world, it has given rise to another issue around the use of animals for human gain. For years, bear bile, collected from bears held in containment, has been touted as a cure for many ailments. It is no different in the wake of COVID-19, as some tout bear bile as a potential cure for the symptoms of this latest version of the Coronavirus. This unproven, anecdotal-based determination has festered and spread, and given rise to an uptick in current bear bile collection practices not only in countries like China, but also within the United States. Because of this,Senate Bill 3196, The Bear Protection Act of 2020, was introduced in Congress on January 15, 2020. The purpose of the bill is “[t]o conserve global bear populations by prohibiting the importation, exportation, and interstate trade of bear viscera and items, products, or substances containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, bear viscera, and for other purposes.”  The Act covers many different species of bears, some of which have been decimated by these practices both here in the US and abroad. The purpose of the act includes the prohibition of interstate and international trade in bear products, the encouragement of efforts across all lines to eliminate the trade, and ensuring that Federal legislation is enacted to contain and/or eliminate the trade of products containing bear viscera. This Act is just a drop in the bucket in stemming the tide of the use of animals in so-called holistic cures that have thus far shown no proven efficacy regarding the claims made.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/ag-gag-a-real-threat-to-animals-and-the-first-amendment/","Over the last 10 – 15 years, states have rushed to put into place so called “Ag-Gag” laws. These laws are meant to limit or altogether eliminate whistleblower and undercover activities, particularly within agricultural facilities. These laws are meant to keep the public in the dark about how the animals in these facilities are treated, and not show common incidents such as as abuse, neglect, disease, and injury. Humane laws have been enacted across the United States to ensure a level of care for animals in these industries, and undercover investigators for organizations such as Mercy for Animals, PETA, and the Humane Society have been helpful in exposing those who do not adhere to the standards. Ag-Gag laws, however, seek to criminalize these activities, leaving the oversight of factory farms to the factory farm industry itself, clearly not an unbiased body. While these laws are meant to protect factory farms and other animal agricultural industries, many of the laws that are being developed make it a criminal offense to document not only agricultural facilities, but any private business, such as hospitals, senior care homes, veteran facilities, and schools. Two such laws recently passed in North Carolina and Arkansas. The North Carolina law included language that stated that individuals who exposed improper actions and attempted to share it with the public would be subject to criminal investigations, as well as lawsuits and damages. Thankfully, this law was ruled unconstitutional as it violated First Amendment rights, and was struck down by the district court. Recently, our own Pittsburgh Post-Gazette published an opinion piece about Ag-Gag. (It should be noted thatH.B.","text",5

Unfortunately, there is a plethora of misconceptions surrounding betta fish, much to the extreme detriment of these beautiful, sentient creatures Danger in Procurement and Transfer While some bettas are captured in the wild, the vast majority of those sold in the US come frombreeding farms in Thailand and other countries in Southeast Asia, where it is common practice tokeep them in small bottles. When it is time to pack them for transport, fish are haphazardlydumped into baskets covered with nets and scooped into tiny plastic cups. Then, they’re packedup to be sent to the US. Common pet store suppliers, like Segrest Farms, admit to sourcing bettasfrom Thailand. When betta fish are shipped to countries around the world, the journey can take several days.Bettas are commonly transported withoutany food and barely any water Workers have told eyewitnesses that atranquilizer is added to the water so the fish won’t eat their own tails in desperation. During transport, bettas are confined individually to incredibly tiny bagsthat are stuffed into boxes and then stacked up high in massive wholesale warehouses Many bettas die before reaching their intended destination. According to one pet store worker, awell-knownsupplier often ships 100,000 betta fish per week to the U.S. and up to 1,000 of the fish die before they reach distributors.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/regional-initiatives/freedom-for-fish/the-truth-about-betta-fish/","Forced to Live Cruel and Unnatural Lives In the wild, bettas live in Asia, where their homes are the shallow waters of rice paddies, ponds, or slow-moving streams. Since those waters aren’t deep, they stay warm, which is whybettaswho live in human homes require a regularly cleaned aquarium with at least 10 gallons of water heated tobetween 76 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit, a good filtration system, and enrichments, such as caves,rocks, and live plants. Selling bettas in tiny bowls or cups perpetuates theharmful myth that Bettas are easy “starter” pets that must be kept in tanks alone.Bettas do NOT have to live alone.Female bettas can live together, and while male bettas will fight with other males, they can beplaced in a “community” aquarium containing other species of fish Plant roots are NOT adequate food for betta fish. Bettas are carnivorous animals who, in nature,eat mostly insects and insect larvae. Pet shops, discount superstores, florists, and even online catalogs sell “decorative” bettas insmall cups or flower vases. The fish often live in just a few ounces of water, which is hardlyenough to turn around in, much less swim in. In addition, keeping bettas in small glass or vases with plants makes it hard for them to breathe, because they get their oxygen from the surface of the water,and anarrow container with a plant can interfere with this. Further, a diet consisting solely of plant roots may keep them alivefor a while, but since it lacks the proper nutrients for this species, the fish eventually becomesick and starve to death. Instead of swimming as far as they want in the wild, bettas sold as pets are forced to exist in tinyglass bowls or vases that are way too small and cold for them.","text",11

Male bettas are devoted fathers who build bubble nests for their youngwith their mouths and fiercely protect their babies from predators. Bettas stop killing eachother and instead exhibit cooperative group behavior when they’re released from the“artificiality of captivity.” However, these sensitive fish continue to suffer greatly in the pet trade,where they’re subjected to inadequate care from the time they’re born on breeding farms towhen they’re transported to pet stores and to when they’re ultimately sold.","text",13

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/campaigns/regional-initiatives/freedom-for-fish/the-truth-about-betta-fish/","What Is HAP Doing About It? Our first step is to educate the public of the inhumane treatment fish encounter when caught from the wild to be imprisoned in tiny tanks as pets or killed for food. Awareness is key while fighting for the lives of fish, who are capable of remembering past social interactions with other fish and show affection by rubbing up against one another. Through our“Better for Betta Fish”campaign, we’re working with pet stores to stop the sale of betta fish as pets, leaving them in their natural habitat to thrive. How You Can Help Change starts with you! If there isn’t a demand for fish as food or ornamental decoration, the supply and terrible practices will decrease. Please help us in taking a stand against the fishing industry and senseless lives lost. Learning about the horrors of the fishing industry and the plight of Betta fish captured and sold as pets–and educating others about these issues–can help. You can also help to educate pet stores where you see injured, sick, or abused fish, if you feel comfortable doing so.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/bat-conflict-solutions","While bats rarely cause problems for humans, they may accidentally come into contact with humans—some may even live unnoticed for years in attics. If you do come across a bat in your home, don’t panic. Bats may hang under eaves, a porch or garage to rest in between flights while feeding. This feeding itself is beneficial to humans by eating mosquitoes and other insects. If you do find a bat in your home, it’s possible to release them without harm. How Do Bats Get In? Bats don’t burrow into buildings but find existing openings. This may include small openings or gaps on houses. One simple solution may be to use a check valve that you can get at a hardware store. It can be draped over the opening that you suspect bats are using to enter and exit the building. Bats will attempt to re-enter where they did initially, but the check valve will prevent re-entry. If you are unable to evict a bat yourself, callHumane Animal Rescue of Pittsburghfor assistance in finding help.

It can be released safely and humanely. On occasion, a bat may find themselves in your home. If so follow these steps: When to Evict If you choose to evict a bat on your own, the goal is to do so humanely by allowing bats to leave so that they cannot re-enter. You should only evict if young are not present. Many states do not allow evicting bats during the months of May–August when bats may have young. You should also check with your state wildlife agency to know what laws apply in your area. Fall may be the best time to evict bats as it is between the seasons of raising young and hibernating for the winter. Here is an overview of steps that can help to evict bats:","text",4

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/bat-conflict-solutions","Worried about Disease? Don’t let the threat of rabies prevent you from protecting bats.Bats are rarely rabid—and they are unlikely to be aggressive. Bats who do contract rabies die quickly, so they don’t cause an ongoing threat. Follow normal safety practices: Do not handle bats with bare hands, warn children not to handle bats, and vaccinate dogs and cats for rabies. When a human is exposed to rabies due to a bat bite it is often because a human has carelessly handled a bat and may even be unaware they have been bitten. The CDC recommends capturing any bat found in the room of a person that is sleeping. Unfortunately, the bat will be killed to determine if it has rabies. This test is recommended as a precaution as an individual may be unaware that they have been bitten. Contact your doctor if you suspect a bat bite may have occurred. Most importantly, never pick up a bat with your bare hands What If I Find a Bat? Sometimes when a bat is found outside on the ground, it is assumed that the bat is rabid, but this may not be the case. The bat may simply be sick or hurt from flying into a window. Bats are typically not aggressive and do not bite unless provoked. If you do find a bat, callHumane Animal Rescue of Pittsburgh.

The More You Know Understand that bears are very beneficial to our ecosystem – they disperse more seeds than birds, create greater biological diversity, and break logs, which helps return nutrients to the soil. Some people believe that hunting bears will help reduce conflicts, but studies have found this can actually have the opposite effect because bear populations rebound with the increased availability of food.  In addition, hunters will not necessarily hunt the bears causing the conflict. To avoid any bear encounters, you can take a few simple steps: Keep your feeders clean, make sure they’re mounted properly, and choose durable feeders, made from either solid metal or durable plastic.  Cage and tube feeders are more difficult for bears to access!  You can also put vinegar or ammonia on the ground around the feeder.","text",2

Doing so misrepresents the mission of these organizations. At Humane Action Pittsburgh, we believe we cannot thoroughly promote the protection of animals while simultaneously serving animals on plates at our events. As such, we guarantee that all HAP events are completely plant-based, whether they are hosted by HAP or sponsored by a third party. Factory Farm Cruelty The U.S. is ranked the number one meat eating country in the world. That requires a massive production of meat each year. The USDA reports that 9.76 billion land animals were killed in 2020. 99%of all farm animals in the U.S. live in factory farms, also referred to as concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). Farm animals are also the mostabused animalson the planet. CAFOs are purposely kept away from public view because of their mistreatment of animals (out of sight, out of mind). CAFOs keep the vast majority of their animals in dirty, cramped conditions. These animals are denied even the most basic of needs, often including the ability to turn around. In their short lives, these animals are bred, mutilated, and pumped full of additives and antibiotics. They’re living and dying in a way that is not natural.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/skunk-conflict-solutions","Skunk Conflict Solutions Seeing skunks in your neighborhood is nothing unusual or dangerous.  Skunks will not intentionally bother people, and benefit humans greatly because they eat insects and rodents we consider pests. They are active during twilight (nocturnal) and like to sleep under or in tight-fitting spaces. Please be sure to eliminate food sources around the yard (like food bowls, fallen fruit from trees, low-hanging bird feeders, etc.). Skunks have five toes on the front paws and four on the back, but the tracks are sometimes mistaken for a common cat. Skunks can’t retract their claws, so their tracks have a large nail impression. If you do have a conflict with a skunk, please avoid calling Animal Care and Control, or a pest control company.  By state law, these animals must be killed when trapped by professionals, and it’s typically not done in a humane way.  Common means of killing by wildlife control companies are injecting acetone into the animal’s chest with a syringe and drowning, both very inhumane and unnecessary. Remember that trappingdoes not workas a long term solution.  What does?  Read our tips below.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/skunk-conflict-solutions","Under the Porch, Deck, or Stairs? If you’re dealing with a skunk taking care of their young, can you possibly wait until the babies are a little older? If you can, the skunks will leave on their own.  If you can’t, try putting socks or tennis balls soaked in vinegar nearby.  You should also put a one-way door orL-shaped barrierto prevent future reentry, but make sure there are no babies left behind first. On Your Window Well Skunks have poor eyesight and can sometimes get into unlikely situations.  If you have a skunk on your window well, try putting a wide board, slanted at a 45 degree angle into the window well (add a towel or rope for traction).  The skunk should climb out on his own. You can also try lowering a large bucket or garbage can with cheese, tuna, or sardines inside into the window well.  If you drill holes into the can to thread a rope, you can more easily lower and lift it out of the window well.  Make sure the can is on its side so the skunk can walk in.  If the skunk starts to stamp his feet or raise her tail, slowly move away until the behavior ceases and you can try again.  Once the skunk is fully inside, slowly tip up the can and put to ground level.  Make sure to cover your window wells when you’re finished. In Your Woodpiles Chili powder is a nontoxic irritant that should deter any mammals.  Sprinkle the chili powder anywhere the skunks are frequenting. You can also place vinegar soaked socks or tennis balls, or spray directly on areas the skunks are going.  You should reapply daily. On Your Property Your bird feeder may be the issue.  Birds can leave messes behind when feasting from your bird feeder and rats may see this as a delectable feast for them to enjoy. If your bird feeder is not the issue, it may be that your yard could use some tidying up.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/skunk-conflict-solutions","Digging In Your Lawn This would probably only be an issue when it rains, and once your lawn dries out, digging will stop.  You can try natural repellents like Milky Spore applied to the lawn, or sprinkle cayenne pepper on localized digging. Prevent Denning Before taking any measure of prevention, please ensure there are no animals currently in the area.  You can do this by putting loose soil, leaves, straw, or crumbled paper in the hole.  If after three or four days this material is undisturbed, you can be confident the hole is unoccupied.  You can prevent skunks or other creatures from denning in these holes with anL-shaped footerof welded wire or similar barriers. If a skunk is denning, try putting socks or tennis balls soaked in vinegar nearby.  You should also put a one-way door orL-shaped barrierto prevent future reentry, but make sure there are no babies left behind first.  You can also try light and noise. Repellents To deter skunks from denning or other unwanted presences, you can use a mild repellent, like kitty litter, near or inside the den so that the skunk must pass through it to get out.  You can also try capsaicin or caster oil repellents. Skunks have a strong sense of smell. You can make a homemade repellent by using a mixture of hot peppers, onion, jalapeno, cayenne pepper, and water. Boil for a few minutes then strain and pour inside a spray bottle. Each dose should last up to 5 days. You can also use high-frequency ultrasonic repellents Please never buy skunk deterrents based on predator urine, as these are made under very inhumane conditions and unnecessary to effectively repel skunks. In Your Garage or Shed Make sure you get rid of wood, debris, rocks, or other covers that may look like an attractive den site. Close off spaces beneath your deck and porch to keep skunks from making their den there. You can skunk proof these areas using heavy gauge galvanized hardware cloth. Can also cover entry points with concrete, sheet metal, or wire mesh.","text",7
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/skunk-conflict-solutions","Skunks are nocturnal, so if you simply leave the door open before dusk, the skunk will typically leave on their own.  Ensure that things like bird seed or pet food are secured in tight containers.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/skunk-conflict-solutions","Rabies Concerns Skunks are nocturnal, but do sometimes look for food during the day, especially during baby season in the spring.  Donotbe concerned if you see a skunk during the day.  You should only be concerned if the skunk is exhibiting abnormal behaviors, such as limb paralysis, circling, unprovoked aggression, disorientation, or staggering. If you do exhibit a skunk with the behavior described above, you should call your local animal control officer or police department. However, keep in mind that by state law, these animals must be killed when trapped by professionals, and it’s typically not done in a humane way. Threats of Spraying Skunks will not intentionally bother a human.  They will only spray if they or their young feel threatened.  Even then, there are many signs they give off to warn prior to a spray, including stomping their feet, raising their tail, hissing, and twisting their bottom towards you.  If you encounter a skunk giving off this type of body language, simply move away slowly and quietly. If you or your pet are sprayed, don’t panic.  A tomato juice bath will only reduce the stench, so try this recipe from the HSUS for effective stench removal, that is safe for humans and pets: Mix together: Wearing rubber gloves, wash with this solution immediately after the spraying occurs. DO NOT get the solution in eyes. (If you don’t have peroxide, baking soda, and liquid soap on hand, use vinegar diluted with water.) Caution: Do NOT store this mixture or make it ahead of time, as the mixture could explode if left in a bottle. Rub the mixture all over and scrub deep to neutralize the odor — however, if you’re washing your dog or cat, don’t leave the mixture on longer than you have to as peroxide can bleach fur. Rinse the solution off thoroughly, and the smell should be gone.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/groundhog-woodchuck-conflict-solutions","Groundhog/Woodchuck Conflict Solutions Groundhogs, also called woodchucks, are common throughout Pennsylvania. Of course, we are all familiar with the most famous Pennsylvania groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, who predicts the end of winter each February. However, a groundhog’s feeding and burrowing may cause conflicts with humans from time to time. Damage can especially be problematic on farms, in home gardens, orchards, and nurseries. However, there are many techniques to help humans and groundhogs live harmoniously. The first issue when dealing with wildlife conflicts is to accurately identify the animal causing damage. It’s important to note that groundhogs hibernate from early November to late February, so if you are experiencing damage during that time, it is likely from another animal, such as a deer or rabbit. If you are confident that a groundhog is the one causing damage, there are several techniques you can use to address the issues. How to tell if you’re dealing with a groundhog: The best time to get rid of a groundhog is in mid-late summer to avoid separating a mom from her babies. If you do have a conflict with a groundhog, please avoid calling Animal Care and Control, or a pest control company.  By state law, these animals must be killed when trapped by professionals, and it’s typically not done in a humane way.  Common means of killing by wildlife control companies are injecting acetone into the animal’s chest with a syringe and drowning, both very inhumane and unnecessary.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/groundhog-woodchuck-conflict-solutions","Tolerance Groundhogs are an important part of the ecosystem, providing food for coyotes, foxes, weasels, badgers, hawks, and eagles. Their burrows give shelter to amphibians, reptiles, smaller rodents, and even larger animals like foxes. Humans and groundhogs have coexisted for years without conflict. If you have a groundhog burrow on your property and don’t have any conflicts with it, please consider letting it be. Eviction From Burrows If burrows are problematic to your land, eviction and exclusion are recommended. Groundhogs can be harried from burrows by harassment or by disturbing the burrow system. However, there is only a small window of time in the year when this can be done humanely, so timing is crucial. Breeding females have dependent young in their burrows from late winter until spring or early summer, and eviction during this time would be inhumane. Females will resist abandoning their young, even under great duress. However, if you wait too late in the year when groundhogs put on weight and secure a suitable location to hibernate, you will impede their winter survival. As such, the best time to evict is from mid-late summer or between early July and late September. If you watch closely, you may actually see the young groundhogs as they first venture above ground. If so, you can begin eviction about three weeks later with relative assurance that it will avoid affecting the offspring. Before you close a burrow, make sure you test for activity. Loosely plug all of the burrow entrances with grass clippings, newspaper, or similar material, and then monitor activity to determine if the burrow is currently vacant. If, after three to five days in clear summer weather, the material has not been disturbed, you can assume the burrow is unoccupied. At this point, you can use heavy-gauge, welded fencing wire (with no larger than three-inch squares) to close burrows.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/groundhog-woodchuck-conflict-solutions","Groundhogs like to navigate in fairly high vegetation. As such, removing vegetation around burrows can create insecurity and, with other eviction methods applied simultaneously, can encourage them to abandon a burrow system. During the course of the year, groundhogs routinely move between burrow systems, and a burrow may be abandoned or unoccupied for weeks or even months before it is reopened.","text",7

Fences work best when protecting relatively small areas. At a minimum, a successful fence should: As cautious animals, groundhogs can be frightened by new objects in the environment, such as silver Mylar helium balloons or a beach ball suspended in the air. These scare devices may keep them away temporarily but are more likely to be effective if they are changed frequently.","text",9

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/opossums/","Opossums Conflict Solutions Opossums are one of the cutest animals (who can resist those little pouches), and they are usually not aggressive.  They very rarely get rabies, and are also very well-behaved — when people complain about opossums, it’s often another species causing the issue, as opossums rarely get into garbage cans or gardens.  However, here are humane solutions (that actually work!) for some of the most common opossum conflicts. Under Your Porch or Deck To keep opossums from under your deck or porch, try to keep any holes filled to ensure they can’t get there in the first place!  Just make sure the area is clear so you don’t trap any animals.  Two hours after dark, you can close any openings with netting or straw so that if an animal is trapped inside, they can get out, but an animal from the outside won’t be tempted to crawl in.  After 2 or 3 nights, if the netting or straw is undisturbed, you can properly fill the hole with an “L” footer, or other permanent exclusion. If they’ve already moved in, you actually don’t need to do anything.  Opossums are nomadic and will leave on their own. Opossums Through Your Pet Door If an opossum comes in through your pet door, don’t panic!  Close the doors to all your inside rooms and open the door to the outside.  You should be able to gently nudge them to leave with a broom – opossums are not usually aggressive!","text",3

In Compost Piles If opossums (or other animals) are getting into your compost pile, mix kitchen garbage with soil or wood ashes before burying in the hot center of the compost piles.  Please do not put any food scraps in open compost piles, but if you must, bury then under at least 8” of soil and put a wire mesh barrier over the top held in place with a heavy object.  You can also put your compost in a pest-proof container, or a bin with a wire top or sealed lid.","text",5

Know that opossums can be beneficial for your garden!  They eat snails, slugs, insects, and even small rodents.  They also will clean up spilled trash and fruit fallen from trees.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/canada-geese/","Canada Geese Conflict Solutions Canada geese are harmless birds, but killing has become a common (and short-term only) solution in many communities.  While killing Canada geese is extremely inhumane, it also does not solve any issues long-term because a new flock will just replace the one exterminated.  The best long-term solutions rely in treating the conflicts at its source – by making areas disagreeable for the birds. Canada geese should not be killed,especially when effective and humane solutions exist. ​Limiting Flock Growth Probably the most humane and effective solution to goose conflicts is to limit flock growth and stabilize populations.  This can be done by keeping eggs from hatching in a process known as “addling.” Addling is done by treating eggs with corn oil or by removing the eggs from the nest, which is humane if done in a very early stage of development.  It limits the number of geese in a flock, and also frees adult geese from tending to their babies, so they can be encouraged to move out of the area where the conflicts are occurring. If addling sounds like something you and your community are interested in taking on, some training will be required.  Humane Action Pittsburgh recommendsHSUSas a resource for further learning about how addling can humanely and effectively solve your Canada goose conflicts. Note that you may will permission from thePennsylvania Game Commissionfirst. Humanely Scaring Geese Canada geese will not leave their babies until they can fly at the end of summer.If geese are tending to their goslings, the techniques described below are not a humane option.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/canada-geese/","Are Round-Ups a Good Solution? In a word – no.  They are inhumane, ineffective, and completely unnecessary. Geese who are rounded up are often packed in small crates and taken to slaughterhouses to be killed and processed.  Since Canada geese are federally protected, their meat cannot be sold.  Instead, they are sometimes offered to food banks.  This may make it seem they were killed for a noble purpose, but providing food to the needy is not the motivation for these round-ups. If the geese are not taken to the slaughterhouse, they are sometimes killed by lethal gas and then dumped in trash bags. The worst part is, these round-ups do not solve the root problem since more geese will just move in where the old ones no longer live.  As mentioned above, there are many humane solutions that will solve the problem long-term. Further, remember that Canada geese are protected federally.  If you are harming geese on public or private property, it is possible you could be breaking the law.

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/injured-or-orphaned-wildlife","How to Tell if Wildlife Is Injured or Orphaned How do you tell if wildlife is injured or orphaned? It’s common to see baby wild animals outside during spring.  They may appear to need our help, but unless the animal is truly orphaned or injured, there is no need to rescue them. These tips can help you decide whether to take action. Signs that a wild animal needs your help: If you see any of these signs, find help for the animal. If necessary,safely capture and transportthem to the appropriate place for treatment. Species-Specific Tips Whether an animal is orphaned and needs your help depends on their age, species, and behavior. Babies of some species are left alone all day and rely on camouflage for protection, while others are tightly supervised by their parents. Read on for descriptions of what’s normal for each species. Baby birds If baby birds are clearly injured or in imminent danger, contact alicensed wildlife rehabilitator. If featherless or nearly featherless baby birds have fallen from their nest but appear unharmed, put them back in the nest if you can do so without danger to yourself.  Understand that it’s a myth that mother birds will reject their young if a person touches them. Fully feathered birds: If the original nest was destroyed or is too high to reach, hang a small, shallow wicker basket close to where the original nest was. Woven stick baskets from garden stores or supermarket floral departments work well; they resemble natural nests and allow rain to pass through so the birds won’t drown. Adult birds won’t jump into anything they cannot see out of, so make sure the basket is not too deep. Put the fallen babies into the new nest and keep watch from a distance for an hour to make sure the parent birds return to the new nest to feed their chicks. Watch closely, because parent birds can be quite stealthy. If they definitely do not return, contact alicensed wildlife rehabilitator.","text",3
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/injured-or-orphaned-wildlife","Nearly or mostly featherless birds: These birds will become too cold in a makeshift nest, so you must place them in the original nest. If that’s not possible, take them to alicensed wildlife rehabilitator. Remember that baby birds do best when raised by their parents or other birds, so try to reunite them with their parents before calling a rehabilitator.","text",4
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/injured-or-orphaned-wildlife","Fledglings: Birds with fully feathered bodies, but short or non-existent tail feathers may be fledglings (adolescent birds who have left the nest). You might see them hopping on the ground, unable to fly. This is normal; birds learn to fly from the ground up! Fledglings might remain on the ground for a few days or even a week, supervised and fed by their parents a few times each hour before they get the hang of flying. You can tell if the fledglings are being fed by watching from a distance to see whether a parent bird flies over to them, usually a few times an hour. You can also look for white-grey feces near the fledgling. Birds defecate after being fed, so the presence of fecal material means that the birds are being cared for. Be sure to keep cats indoors and dogs leashed until the fledglings are old enough to fly. If you are positive that the parents aren’t returning to feed the babies, contact alicensed wildlife rehabilitator. Baby rabbits Rabbits at least four inches long with open eyes and erect ears and who hop well are independent from their mother and should be allowed to fend for themselves. Uninjured baby rabbits in an intact nest should also be left alone. Although they might look abandoned because their mom isn’t around, mother rabbits visit their dependent young only a few times a day to avoid attracting predators. If the nest has been disturbed, lightly cover it with natural materials you find around the nest, like grass, fur or leaves and follow these steps: Baby squirrels A squirrel who is nearly full-sized, has a full and fluffy tail and can run, jump and climb is independent. However, if a juvenile squirrel continuously approaches and follows people, their mom is probably gone. In this case, you should contact arehabilitatorbecause the baby is very hungry and needs care.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/injured-or-orphaned-wildlife","There are a few cases where you might need to intervene: If the baby and/or their nest fell from the tree today, give the mother squirrel a chance to reclaim their young and relocate them to a new nest. If the baby is uninjured, leave them where they are, leave the area, keep people and pets away and monitor them from a safe distance.","text",6
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/injured-or-orphaned-wildlife","If it’s chilly outside or the baby isn’t fully furred, place them in a shoebox with something warm underneath (like a heating pad on a low setting or a hot water bottle). Be sure to put a flannel shirt between the baby and the heating device, or they could overheat. Do not cover them with anything or the mother might not be able to find them. If the babies are not retrieved by dusk, take these steps: Baby deer People often mistakenly assume that a fawn (baby deer) found alone is orphaned. If the fawn is lying down calmly and quietly, their mother is nearby and they are okay. A doe only visits and nurses their fawn a few times a day to avoid attracting predators. Unless you know that the mother is dead, leave the fawn alone. Although mother deer are wary of human smells, they still want their babies back. If you already handled the fawn, quickly return the fawn to the exact spot where you found them and leave the area; the mother deer will not show herself until you are gone. If the fawn is lying on their side or wandering and crying incessantly all day, they probably need help. If this is the case, contact alicensed wildlife rehabilitator. Baby foxes Fox kits will often appear unsupervised for long periods while their parents are out hunting for food. They will play like puppies around the den site until the parents decide they’re old enough to go on hunting trips. Then they will suddenly disappear. Observe the kits from a distance; if they seem energetic and healthy, leave them alone. If they appear sickly or weak, or if you have reason to believe both parents are dead, contact alicensed wildlife rehabilitator. Baby opossums Baby opossums are born as embryos, barely larger than a bee, and spend about two months nursing in their mother’s pouch. When they get to be about three to four inches long and start riding around on their mother’s back, they may fall off without the mother noticing.","text",7
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/injured-or-orphaned-wildlife","As a general rule, if an opossum is over seven inches long (not including the tail), they’re old enough to be on their own. If they’re less than seven inches long (not including the tail), they are orphaned and you should contact alicensed wildlife rehabilitator.","text",8
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/injured-or-orphaned-wildlife","Baby raccoons If a baby raccoon has been alone for more than a few hours, they are probably an orphan. Mother raccoons don’t let their young out of their sight for long. Put an inverted laundry basket over the baby (with a light weight on top so they cannot push their way out) and monitor them until well into the nighttime hours (raccoons are nocturnal, so the mom should come out at night to reclaim her baby). You can also put the cub in a pet carrier and close the door. Instead of latching it, prop it closed with an angled stick. When the mother returns, she’ll run in front of the carrier, push over the stick and the door will pop open. If the mother does not return, contact alicensed wildlife rehabilitator. In spring and summer, people often set traps in a misguided effort to resolve garbage and other “nuisance” issues. Unfortunately, this approach leads to trapped and killed mothers who leave their starving young behind. If anyone in your neighborhood is setting traps, persuade them to use more humane and effective methods instead. Baby skunks If you see a baby skunk (or a line of baby skunks, nose-to-tail) running around without a mother in sight, they could be orphaned. Skunks have poor eyesight, so if something scares the mother and they run off, the babies can quickly lose sight of them. Monitor the situation to see if the mother rejoins their young. If the babies are on the move, put on gloves and slowly place a plastic laundry basket (with lattice sides) over the babies to keep them in one spot and make it easier for the mother to find them. Do not put a weight on top of the laundry basket. If the mother returns to her young, she will flip up the basket and get them. If she has trouble doing this, you should lift the basket to let them out. Remember that skunks are very near-sighted, so fast movements can startle them into spraying. If you move slowly and speak softly though, you will not get sprayed.","text",9
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/injured-or-orphaned-wildlife","Skunks warn potential predators by stamping their front feet when they’re alarmed, so if the mother doesn’t do this, you’re safe to proceed. If no mother comes to retrieve the young by dawn, contact alicensed wildlife rehabilitator.","text",10

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wild-neighbors/finding-a-wildlife-professional/","Ask for an Inspection and Written Estimate Companies should be able to give you an overview of services and fees over the phone.  During the on-site visit, make sure the company identifies to you: Most companies will, and all should, provide pictures to explain how the animal is using a structure and what needs to be repaired to ensure the structure is wildlife-proof. Ask for Specific Details on How the Company will Handle the Animals and the Underlying Issue Request specific details about how the intrusion or problem will be resolved and how the animal(s) will be treated. Will the animal be killed, and if so, why? Are there offspring that will be orphaned or abandoned? Will the method used resolve the problem for the long-term? Insist on Humane Techniques If an animal is inside a structure, insist on the use of guaranteed eviction/exclusion strategies, such as one-way doors and/or hands-on removal and reunion of families that will ultimately lead to their release outside of the structure. Prevent Future Conflicts Make sure that the company provides a full range of animal-proofing/exclusion services that carry at least a one-year guarantee against re-entry. The job is not complete until the identified access points have been effectively refitted with exclusion material that will stand up to challenge by wildlife. Be Aware of Unethical Fees or Practices Never sign a contract that contains an open-ended clause allowing a company to charge for removal of any and every animal that can be trapped on the property. This is an unethical practice and will not solve conflicts for the long-term. Referrals Obtain a referral for the company from one of HAP’s endorsedwildlife rehabilitator,Humane Animal Rescue of Pittsburgh, or another local humane society. Make Sure the Company is Licensed and Insured Request written assurance that the company’s practices are in compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations.","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/pigeons/","Pigeons Conflict Solutions Pigeons are a staple of city living. However, many property owners do not want pigeons inside or around their buildings. Thankfully, there are many humane methods owners can follow to help keep pigeons out of their buildings. As a reminder, it is illegal in Pittsburgh to harm any wild bird, including pigeons, or to trap any wild bird unless you are a qualified and trained professional as defined byOrdinance No. 36that HAP helped pass. Make Flat Surfaces Less Appealing Pigeons roost and nest on flat surfaces, so eliminating flat surfaces on your home or building is key. There are a number of products on the market to achieve this, such asBirdslides, which attach over window ledges and other flat surfaces at a 45-60 degree angle to keep pigeons from landing, andbird wires, which keep pigeons off ledges, railings, awnings, and rooftops. However, please note that we do not recommend using polybutylene gel or other sticky gel repellents that can harm birds and other wildlife. Install a Motion-Activated Sprinkler An unexpected spray of water is a humane and non-toxic way to get rid of pigeons. Install a “Scare-Pigeon” Pigeons are prey for larger raptors, such as falcons and hawks. Installing a life-like model of a pigeon’s predator may keep pigeons away. It is important that the model is 3D, life-size, and makes raptor movements and sounds. Additionally, scare-pigeons should be moved from time to time so pigeons do not see past the trick.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wild-neighbors/what-to-do-about-deer/","One of the most beautiful creatures in the Western Pennsylvania area is certainly the deer.  That does not necessarily mean you want them in your garden or on your property. If you can’t tolerate deer in your garden, you can always try a good repellent.  If that doesn’t work, you may want to consider changing the plants in your garden or using deer-proof fencing.","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wild-neighbors/what-to-do-about-deer/","Repellents Our recommended repellent is to take 2 large heads of garlic halved, 2 large and strong halved onions, and simmer in 4 quarts of water for 4 hours (outside if possible).  Let cool and strain.  Then, add ½ can hot Hungarian paprika with 1 teaspoon of dish soap. Remember that a variety of repellents in combination will probably work best.  You can look for repellents that contain sulphurous odor (you know, the stuff that smells like rotten eggs) and apply them before bud-break and as new growth appears.Liquid FenceandBobbexare the most highly recommended. You can reapply repellents after heavy rains, and often (every 2 – 3 weeks).  You may want to alternate repellents so that deer don’t get used to one or the other. For applying repellents, check out these tips from HSUS:","text",5

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wild-neighbors/what-to-do-about-deer/","Fencing If you still can’t keep deer out of your garden, try fencing.  Remember that deer can jump fences up to 8 feet high, so the 8 foot high woven wire fence is the most effective deer barrier – and it can last more than 20 years!  Local home and garden stores can help you decide what’s best for your yard. Though deer may be able to jump over electric fences, they can provide a psychological barrier for them.  Some electric fences even have a scented bait attachment to ensure that deer make contact with the fence.  They will receive a mild jolt, but should not be caused any real harm.  You can also take tin foil squares containing a bit of peanut butter to provide the same effect when folded over single or multi-strand electric fences. Remember that electric fences must be maintained with regular voltage checks.  If an electric fence is not for you, you may want to check out theHavahard 5250 Electeronic Deer Repellentthat has 3 stake-like devices and a scent lure that will give deer a mild electric shock. More Tips If deer are causing damage by rubbing against trees to remove the velvet from their antlers (a process called “back rubs”), place cylinders of hardware cloth or corrugated plastic sleeves around the tree trunks. To protect low-growing plants or vegetables, drape mesh, chicken wire, or hardware cloth.  Please don’t use netting or birds may get caught. If you have specific trees or shrubs that you won’t to protect, hang a bar of Irish Spring on them. Motion-activated sprinklers (like theScarecroworHavahart) may startle deer, and when used in conjunction with other tips found on this page can be very effective.  The Deer Shield Electronic Deer Guard is another device you may want to try.  It lets out digital recordings of alarmed and territorial deer that may incentivize the real deer to go elsewhere. Are Deer Overpopulated?","text",9
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wild-neighbors/what-to-do-about-deer/","As suburban sprawl has increased, humans have been taking over the deer’s habitat.  One might think there are too many deer around, but most problems are completely unrelated to the greater population’s numbers.  If a deer is eating your plants, it is not indicative of a population problem – it’s indicative of one, or a few, specific deer that enjoy eating plants.","text",10
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wild-neighbors/what-to-do-about-deer/","Deer culling, or deer killing, is at best a short-term, inhumane, and ineffective approach.  The root cause of the issue must be addressed before deer (or any wildlife) conflicts can be solved in the long-term.  To learn more on why killing doesn’t work, check out the HSUS Wild Neighborswebsite.","text",11

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/house-sparrows/","House Sparrows Conflict Solutions Did you know that house sparrows (the little brown birds we see all the time on city streets) are one of the most common birds to be found in cities due to their reliance on the food and shelter we provide?  Unfortunately, that means they are also one of the most common species for wildlife conflict encounters.  However, remember that these birds are our city neighbors and deserve to be treated with compassion. UnderOrdinance No. 36that HAP helped passed, it is illegal in Pittsburgh to harm any wild bird. As such, it is strictly prohibited in the City of Pittsburgh to use poison or other inhumane methods. Keep reading for common problems and humane solutions. Stop House Sparrows from Nesting in Building Crevices The best way to prevent house sparrows from building nests in building crevices is to prevent them from building these nests in the first place.  Check the screening over louversbeforethese birds can find their way inside. If prevention isn’t possible because the birds have already nested, it isn’t difficult to remove the birds.  Simply find where they are nesting, make sure there are no babies, remove the nesting material, and block openings with netting, hardware cloth, or other humane materials. Note: If you do find eggs or babies in the nests, please leave them alone.  The babies will hatch at different times and leave over a staggered period, so you may have to wait between two and four weeks.  Make sure to check the nest often and remove the material as soon as the young leave. Dryer and Stove Vents Vents with nests inside may not function properly, and nesting material will need to be removed immediately.","text",3
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/house-sparrows/","If there are babies inside the nest, please leave the vent unused and remove the nesting material as soon as the babies leave on their own.  If leaving the vent unused is not an option, try to assist the parents in raising their young in an alternate nest.  Please see these tips from HSUS: Noisy nestlings usually attract the parents who will continue to care for them. Watch the substitute nest to see that the adults return. They should not take more than a half hour or so, as growing young birds need constant feeding. If the adults do not return to nestlings, contact awildlife rehabilitatorin your area for advice. This procedure won’t work with eggs, and you can remove house sparrow eggs when cleaning nest material out of ducts. However, we recommend leaving them to complete the cycle for this one nesting period, and bear in mind that virtually all birds but starlings and house sparrows are protected by federal law, and to remove their nests or eggs would be illegal.","text",4

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/love-your-wild-neighbor/house-sparrows/","Public Outdoor Spaces House sparrows enjoy leftovers and dropped crumbs, so clean up food and open trash promptly. Public Indoor Spaces Sometimes house sparrows may move into malls or large stores.  Building managers may hire pest control companies to shoot the birds or – even worse – use glueboard traps, one of the most inhumane products around.  Humane solutions exist. Try bird-proofing entry points by using strip doors or curtains or overlapping flexible strips. If the birds are already inside, they can be removed humanely with nets or live-traps, and then released outside.  Keep in mind this is a short-term solution, and bird-proofing the entry points as described above is the best way to solve the problem long-term, in addition to ensuring open trash and leftover food are not around.

Know that a mouse that has lived in a building for their entire life most likely won’t survive outside.  Please relocate them to an outbuilding like a shed or garage, if possible. Keep Them Out Prevention is key with rodent issues, and since mice can fit into openings the size of a dime, can be difficult. Common entry points include utility pipe and wire entries, deteriorating siding, and cracks in your foundation.  If you think a mouse has entered through a particular area, sprinkle baby powder or flour that will help you find any tracks. Make sure your flowers and shrubs are rimmed at least a foot and a half from your home’s foundation so that, not only will mice find it more difficult to get in, but it will be easier for you to find potential or existing entry points. Repairing any holes that mice may be using is very important. Just like all of us, mice want to eat.  If you’re having mouse issues, make sure your home is free from food sources for them.  For example:","text",3

"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wild-neighbors/how-to-tell-if-wildlife-is-injured-or-orphaned/","How to Tell if Wildlife is Injured or Orphaned? How do you tell if wildlife is injured or orphaned? It’s common to see baby wild animals outside during spring.  They may appear to need our help, but unless the animal is truly orphaned or injured, there is no need to rescue them. These tips can help you decide whether to take action. Signs that a wild animal needs your help: If you see any of these signs, find help for the animal. If necessary,safely capture and transportthem to the appropriate place for treatment. Species-Specific Tips Whether an animal is orphaned and needs your help depends on their age, species, and behavior. Babies of some species are left alone all day and rely on camouflage for protection, while others are tightly supervised by their parents. Read on for descriptions of what’s normal for each species. Baby birds If baby birds are clearly injured or in imminent danger, contact alicensed wildlife rehabilitator. If featherless or nearly featherless baby birds have fallen from their nest but appear unharmed, put them back in the nest if you can do so without danger to yourself.  Understand that it’s a myth that mother birds will reject their young if a person touches them. Fully feathered birds: If the original nest was destroyed or is too high to reach, hang a small, shallow wicker basket close to where the original nest was. Woven stick baskets from garden stores or supermarket floral departments work well; they resemble natural nests and allow rain to pass through so the birds won’t drown. Adult birds won’t jump into anything they cannot see out of, so make sure the basket is not too deep. Put the fallen babies into the new nest and keep watch from a distance for an hour to make sure the parent birds return to the new nest to feed their chicks. Watch closely, because parent birds can be quite stealthy. If they definitely do not return, contact alicensed wildlife rehabilitator.","text",3
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wild-neighbors/how-to-tell-if-wildlife-is-injured-or-orphaned/","Nearly or mostly featherless birds: These birds will become too cold in a makeshift nest, so you must place them in the original nest. If that’s not possible, take them to alicensed wildlife rehabilitator. Remember that baby birds do best when raised by their parents or other birds, so try to reunite them with their parents before calling a rehabilitator.","text",4
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wild-neighbors/how-to-tell-if-wildlife-is-injured-or-orphaned/","Fledglings: Birds with fully feathered bodies, but short or non-existent tail feathers may be fledglings (adolescent birds who have left the nest). You might see them hopping on the ground, unable to fly. This is normal; birds learn to fly from the ground up! Fledglings might remain on the ground for a few days or even a week, supervised and fed by their parents a few times each hour before they get the hang of flying. You can tell if the fledglings are being fed by watching from a distance to see whether a parent bird flies over to them, usually a few times an hour. You can also look for white-grey feces near the fledgling. Birds defecate after being fed, so the presence of fecal material means that the birds are being cared for. Be sure to keep cats indoors and dogs leashed until the fledglings are old enough to fly. If you are positive that the parents aren’t returning to feed the babies, contact alicensed wildlife rehabilitator. Baby rabbits Rabbits at least four inches long with open eyes and erect ears and who hop well are independent from their mother and should be allowed to fend for themselves. Uninjured baby rabbits in an intact nest should also be left alone. Although they might look abandoned because their mom isn’t around, mother rabbits visit their dependent young only a few times a day to avoid attracting predators. If the nest has been disturbed, lightly cover it with natural materials you find around the nest, like grass, fur or leaves and follow these steps: Baby squirrels A squirrel who is nearly full-sized, has a full and fluffy tail and can run, jump and climb is independent. However, if a juvenile squirrel continuously approaches and follows people, their mom is probably gone. In this case, you should contact arehabilitatorbecause the baby is very hungry and needs care.","text",5
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wild-neighbors/how-to-tell-if-wildlife-is-injured-or-orphaned/","There are a few cases where you might need to intervene: If the baby and/or their nest fell from the tree today, give the mother squirrel a chance to reclaim their young and relocate them to a new nest. If the baby is uninjured, leave them where they are, leave the area, keep people and pets away and monitor them from a safe distance.","text",6
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wild-neighbors/how-to-tell-if-wildlife-is-injured-or-orphaned/","If it’s chilly outside or the baby isn’t fully furred, place them in a shoebox with something warm underneath (like a heating pad on a low setting or a hot water bottle). Be sure to put a flannel shirt between the baby and the heating device, or they could overheat. Do not cover them with anything or the mother might not be able to find them. If the babies are not retrieved by dusk, take these steps: Baby deer People often mistakenly assume that a fawn (baby deer) found alone is orphaned. If the fawn is lying down calmly and quietly, their mother is nearby and they are okay. A doe only visits and nurses their fawn a few times a day to avoid attracting predators. Unless you know that the mother is dead, leave the fawn alone. Although mother deer are wary of human smells, they still want their babies back. If you already handled the fawn, quickly return the fawn to the exact spot where you found them and leave the area; the mother deer will not show herself until you are gone. If the fawn is lying on their side or wandering and crying incessantly all day, they probably need help. If this is the case, contact alicensed wildlife rehabilitator. Baby foxes Fox kits will often appear unsupervised for long periods while their parents are out hunting for food. They will play like puppies around the den site until the parents decide they’re old enough to go on hunting trips. Then they will suddenly disappear. Observe the kits from a distance; if they seem energetic and healthy, leave them alone. If they appear sickly or weak, or if you have reason to believe both parents are dead, contact alicensed wildlife rehabilitator. Baby opossums Baby opossums are born as embryos, barely larger than a bee, and spend about two months nursing in their mother’s pouch. When they get to be about three to four inches long and start riding around on their mother’s back, they may fall off without the mother noticing.","text",7
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wild-neighbors/how-to-tell-if-wildlife-is-injured-or-orphaned/","As a general rule, if an opossum is over seven inches long (not including the tail), they’re old enough to be on their own. If they’re less than seven inches long (not including the tail), they are orphaned and you should contact alicensed wildlife rehabilitator.","text",8
"https://humaneactionpittsburgh.org/wild-neighbors/how-to-tell-if-wildlife-is-injured-or-orphaned/","Baby raccoons If a baby raccoon has been alone for more than a few hours, they are probably an orphan. Mother raccoons don’t let their young out of their sight for long. Put an inverted laundry basket over the baby (with a light weight on top so they cannot push their way out) and monitor them until well into the nighttime hours (raccoons are nocturnal, so the mom should come out at night to reclaim her baby). You can also put the cub in a pet carrier and close the door. Instead of latching it, prop it closed with an angled stick. When the mother returns, she’ll run in front of the carrier, push over the stick and the door will pop open. If the mother does not return, contact alicensed wildlife rehabilitator. In spring and summer, people often set traps in a misguided effort to resolve garbage and other “nuisance” issues. Unfortunately, this approach leads to trapped and killed mothers who leave their starving young behind. If anyone in your neighborhood is setting traps, persuade them to use more humane and effective methods instead. Baby skunks If you see a baby skunk (or a line of baby skunks, nose-to-tail) running around without a mother in sight, they could be orphaned. Skunks have poor eyesight, so if something scares the mother and they run off, the babies can quickly lose sight of them. Monitor the situation to see if the mother rejoins their young. If the babies are on the move, put on gloves and slowly place a plastic laundry basket (with lattice sides) over the babies to keep them in one spot and make it easier for the mother to find them. Do not put a weight on top of the laundry basket. If the mother returns to her young, she will flip up the basket and get them. If she has trouble doing this, you should lift the basket to let them out. Remember that skunks are very near-sighted, so fast movements can startle them into spraying. If you move slowly and speak softly though, you will not get sprayed.","text",9

Puppy mills As the “Puppy Mill Capital of the East”, Pennsylvania has some of the worst-of-the-worst puppy mills in the country.  HAP’s multi-faceted approach to ending puppy mill misery included passing the first retail-sales ban of mill-bred animals in PA, which bans pet stores from selling puppy mill dogs.","text",5
