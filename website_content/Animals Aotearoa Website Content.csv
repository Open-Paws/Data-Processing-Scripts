http://www.animalsaotearoa.org/learn/about-better-chicken-commitment,"Each chicken is hung upside down by their feet in metal shackles. This is very  painful considering the poor leg and hip health that many of these birds suffer from. An electrified water bath is then meant to give them a shock that renders them unconscious. However, many are not effectively stunned and continue to the next stage while conscious and still shackled. Their throats are then cut.",text,32
http://www.animalsaotearoa.org/learn/about-better-chicken-commitment,"While there is no humane way to slaughter an animal, the BCC reduces distress and pain at slaughter by requiring the use of controlled atmospheric stunning without live-shackling.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/05/24/animal-sentience-law/,The recent announcement that animals are now to beformally recognized as sentient under UK lawprovides a good basis for campaigners and animal rights activists to push for law change. Alongside the announcement came a number of policy changes that will prevent horrific suffering. These included the banning of export of animals for fattening and slaughter in the UK.,text,7
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/05/24/animal-sentience-law/,New Zealand also recognises animals as sentient under the law.This means that animals are regarded as having the capacity to be aware of sensations.,text,8
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/05/24/animal-sentience-law/,"And yet sadly, this awareness ofsentienceis not given adequate attention. Instead it is given short shrift when industry profit is at risk. While we are aware animals can feel we still subject them to ongoing atrocities.",text,9
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/05/24/animal-sentience-law/,"Sentience is the ability to feel sensation. With sensation comes a range of possible emotions. Take for example the evident satisfaction that a chicken gets from dust bathing. Anyone who keeps chickens knows how much they love to bathe in dry dirt to clean themselves, often together in groups. In fact, dust bathing is a relaxing social activity for chickens.",text,10

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/05/24/animal-sentience-law/,"​In colony cages birds become stressed and often get trapped beneath the ‘perch’. Their bones become brittle from lack of movement and they suffer disease and feather loss. They also experience emotional distress, including anxiety, stress, boredom and fear.",text,12
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/05/24/animal-sentience-law/,It is not at all surprising that cages cause psychological distress. The colony cages provide 750 square cm per bird and are likened by the Egg Producers Federation NZ as an ‘open plan’ home. They claim that egg production is sustainable and meets the hen’s welfare needs. It’s absurd in the extreme and as consumers we need to challenge such wild lies.,text,13
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/05/24/animal-sentience-law/,"In short, while both the United Kingdom and New Zealand recognise laying hens as sentient, they still subject them to enormous suffering.",text,14
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/05/24/animal-sentience-law/,"And that is just one of many examples of how we are being duped and lied to by both legal frameworks and industry. They have each other’s backs, and the animals are the casualties.",text,15
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/05/24/animal-sentience-law/,It’s not a conspiracy. Rather it is cognitive dissonance– that state where you believe something even when all evidence points to the contrary. Sometimes we see only what we want to.,text,16

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/05/24/animal-sentience-law/,"​​The same happens with chickens raised for their meat.These chickens have been bred to grow so large that their bodies can’t keep up with the explosive weight gain.Many die before the six week period when they are slaughtered. They are raised in large indoor sheds with only an about an A4 sheet of paper size per bird. A 2013 Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) report found over half of the chickens studied were unable to walk or move properly, with the implication that they were unable to fully access food and water. Problems also described in the report included joint infections, twisted legs and bone tissue death. And if this isn’t enough, the ammonia from their droppings burns into their feet and ankles joints.These birds then get sent to slaughter at only around six weeks of age when they reach the weight of 2.5 kg, (although some are killed even younger). Handlers catch the chickens, dangling up to four in each hand by their legs and forcing them into small crates. Birds often suffer from dislocated hips, broken wings and legs, and bruising. Once at the slaughter house they endure the aforementioned shackles, electric current bath, electric cutter and boiling bath (to remove feathers). And this is all after a short stay on Earth in an enormous hellish shed. Sounds like a fun day at the park.",text,18

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/08/01/free-range-chickens-still-suffer,"When you hear the term free-range chicken, you might have an image of those birds having a happy existence, wandering outdoors and enjoying life. While free-range certainly makes a huge difference to the welfare of pigs and hens used for egg production, it is a different story for chickens bred for meat.​Many Kiwis try to buy and eat free-range chicken meat. People want a good life for the animals they consume, but the reality for most chickens sold as free-range isa short life of suffering. Caring people are being misled into paying more for so-called free-range chickens who may never see the outside of a shed until they are taken for slaughter.",text,7

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/08/01/free-range-chickens-still-suffer,"There isno legal standard for free-range: all that is required is potential access to the outdoors. Chickens have an innate fear of open spaces (where predators can attack) and can be reluctant to go outside when the only option is a barren space, lacking shelter. This leaves these chickens crammed inside sheds, just like their non-free-range counterparts. Studies on the proportion of birds that go outside free-range sheds vary from 2 to 74%.  Even at the highest end of the scale, that’s one in four birds who spend their whole lives in a crowded shed, sitting and standing in excrement-soaked litter. ​",text,10

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/08/01/free-range-chickens-still-suffer,"When a more suitable outdoor range is provided, such as by Bostock Brothers, with plenty of trees and bushes where the chickens feel safer, more of them do go outside. Even so, because they are still of afast-grow breed, these chickens have restricted mobility and other health problems.

While free-range certainly makes a huge difference to the welfare of pigs and hens used for egg production, it is a different story for chickens bred for meat.​Many Kiwis try to buy and eat free-range chicken meat. People want a good life for the animals they consume, but the reality for most chickens sold as free-range isa short life of suffering.

Chickens have an innate fear of open spaces (where predators can attack) and can be reluctant to go outside when the only option is a barren space, lacking shelter. This leaves these chickens crammed inside sheds, just like their non-free-range counterparts. Studies on the proportion of birds that go outside free-range sheds vary from 2 to 74%.  Even at the highest end of the scale, that’s one in four birds who spend their whole lives in a crowded shed, sitting and standing in excrement-soaked litter. ​",text,10

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/10/28/five-facts-about-fish-farming/,"Have you ever wondered what life is like for a fish? You might think it would be pretty cool to have the freedom to swim for miles across the vast expanse of sea, but that’s a far cry from the lives of farmed fishes*. When you next see a packet of salmon on the supermarket shelf or smoked salmon on a restaurant menu, spare a thought for the individuals farmed for these products.",text,7
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/10/28/five-facts-about-fish-farming/,1. Fishes feel,text,8
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/10/28/five-facts-about-fish-farming/,"Fishes certainly have feelings, both physical and emotional. They can experience both pain and stress. Fishes are recognised as sentient under New Zealand law, which means they are known to experience a range of sensations and emotions, both positive and negative. However, the way they are treated on fish farms so often seems to ignore this sentience.",text,9

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/10/28/five-facts-about-fish-farming/,"In Aotearoa, the fish species farmed is called King Salmon. They are a migratory species.  Born in freshwater, they migrate and spend most of their life at sea before returning to freshwater to spawn. Naturally they travel thousands of kilometres in their lives, but on fish-farms they are trapped in floating cages, crowded in with thousands of other individuals. Their natural instinct to migrate is blocked. Instead,they swim in circles around the cage, rubbing against the mesh and each other.",text,12

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/10/28/five-facts-about-fish-farming/,"Did you know that fishes can get depressed? Up to a quarter of farmed salmon are found floating, listlessly at the surface of the water, their growth stunted. The industry calls them ‘drop outs’. Astudyon farmed Atlantic Salmon in sea cages in Norway showed that the ‘drop out’ fishes’ brain chemistry and behaviour was almost identical to people that are highly stressed and depressed.",text,15

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/10/28/five-facts-about-fish-farming/,"Farmed fishes are prone to a range of health problems and some die before slaughter from the horrible conditions inside fish-farm cages. This is being made worse here in Aotearoa by climate change warming the sea temperature above the range that salmon will survive in. While the exact number of fish dying is not disclosed, New Zealand has a high mortality rate by international standards. According to a Ministry for Primary Industriesreport, NZ King Salmon, (the biggest salmon producer), expects a mortality rate of approximately one quarter. That’s a huge number of individuals who can’t survive the factory-farm environment.",text,18

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/10/28/five-facts-about-fish-farming/,"Fish farming is often promoted as the solution to overfishing, but astudyby the Aquatic Life Institute has found that up to half of all animals caught at sea are fed to fish on farms. A term has been coined for this, ‘blue loss’.",text,21
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/10/28/five-facts-about-fish-farming/,"Salmon are a carnivorous species. They are fed a range of foods which includes other fishes taken from wild populations. This is why, fish-farming adds to the depletion of wild fish numbers, rather than helping provide more food for people.",text,22
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/10/28/five-facts-about-fish-farming/,"So fish farming certainly isn’t a solution to current food problems, and just like other intensively farmed animals, fishes are suffering miserable lives.",text,23

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/11/25/farmwatch-investigator-speaks-out/,"From the exterior of this huge warehouse-like building, we can hear the faint chattering of young birds. High pitched and constant.The massive fans blow dusty, smelly air in our faces and machinery noises heave on and off alarmingly. The grass is wet and boggy. We put on our boot covers. When the door opens I feel a rush of heat and there is an overpowering sickly sweet putrid stench. It’s dark and claustrophobic.​We get busy fumbling around with our gear, screwing on lights, zipping up bags, and slowly turning camera lights on dimly as we try to avoid scaring the birds. They get scared anyway.I scan the sea of bodies for where to start.The chickens move away from us, terrified, but they have nowhere to go. This giant shed is filled with around 40,000 other bodies in the way. They crowd together to avoid us.The birds are large – I guess about five weeks old, so their disabilities are really starting to show. They barely walk, taking only a few stiff steps, then sit down again. At this age, their bodies are unnaturally large, and they are almost ready to be caught and killed for the supermarket freezer.",text,9

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/11/25/farmwatch-investigator-speaks-out/,"After about one minute I spot a dead chicken on the ground, being stood upon by other chickens. This body has been there a while, a few days at least. It’s red, swollen and decomposing. I know this death was unlikely to have been a fast one.I kneel down to film – the ground is hot and spongy. My knee slides a little in the wetness. A chicken defecates right next to me, to remind me of what I’m kneeling in.The floor litter is never changed in the lifetime of these birds, so it’s a thick hot layer of faeces from tens of thousands of chickens.I notice a bird sitting underneath one of the pan feeders with legs splayed out. I immediately recognise this common sign of lameness. I’ve seen it so many times before. This chicken can’t stand, and will struggle to reach the feed. I sit nearby and watch.She spins around in frustration, her wings flapping as she struggles to get up. After a few attempts, she gets to the edge of the feeder and just reaches her beak over the edge, but can’t quite get to the feed. She gives up and collapses back down. I know she will likely die here, right under the food. I push that thought away as there’s work to do.​Straight away I see another bird, flat on the ground, legs splayed out unnaturally. Flapping, struggling, desperately trying to stand. I grab some feed out of the feeder for them to eat. But I know it’s the lack of water that will probably kill them first.",text,11

The birds with splayed legs have no chance of getting anywhere near that water.I think to myself, “How is this shit legal? These birds are going to lie here and die slowly from lack of food and water on the floor of this disgusting shed”. Anger rises, but again, I shut it down – I have to get on with my work. Focus. Focus.Without even moving further into the shed I see another two birds with that same characteristic leg sticking out sideways. They are everywhere. It’s a defect in the genetics of the breed. The industry knows all about it – it’s just one of the many issues caused by growing birds far too fast and keeping them in industrial unnatural environments such as this.And this is a free-range shed, apparently ‘premium’ conditions.​If people saw this for themselves and understood what it means to live (and die) in these windowless barren factories, they wouldn’t buy products like this.But maybe my expectations are too high.

She’s cautious, and I slowly reach out to pat her head, but she darts away – she doesn’t want a bar of it.We finish up filming and I look back at that first bird sitting underneath the feeder, still sitting there, defeated. Briefly, it crosses my mind to take her out of there, stuff her in my jacket and give her a nice life for a little while. But I know the reality, I’ve been here before. These birds aren’t bred to live past six weeks. There are skilled people who would do their best for her, with a lot of resources, time and kindness. But she won’t live long.

Using tactics that have been shown to work or are based on robust research, are the most cost-effective ways to operate.​For example, to address the high amount of suffering for chickens bred for meat, a successful campaign can be measured inWelfare Adjusted Life Years. Organisations/NGOs overseas have campaigned to reduce suffering by persuading businesses to adopt the higher welfare standards of theBetter Chicken Commitment. This is not just a short-term impact as it also affects all animals that go through the supply chain.​Animal Charity Evaluators(ACE) is an organisation set up to measure the effectiveness of the various animal advocacy organisations and recommends the ones they evaluate as doing the most good as a source for donor dollars.N.B.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/05/30/life-of-farmed-salmon-in-nz/,"Currently, over 90% of global fish stocks are either overfished or are being fished at the maximum sustainable level. As fish become increasingly scarce in the oceans, finding and catching them becomes too expensive for many fishing companies to make a sufficient profit. Therefore, it should not come as a surprise that the farming of fish has recently become the fastest-growing agricultural industry in the world. Fish, crustaceans, and molluscs can be raised in cages which removes all the costs associated with finding and catching these animals in the wild. Today,over 100 billion aquatic animals are farmed annually across the globe.",text,8
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/05/30/life-of-farmed-salmon-in-nz/,"New Zealand has a unique part in this global industry. Salmon farming is one of the largest sectors in the farming of aquatic animals. Of the many different species farmed, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is by far the global favourite. However, even though New Zealand‚Äôs largest aquaculture industry is salmon farming, the country only farms a different species called Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). In New Zealand, this species is also commonly referred to as King Salmon – HƒÅmana in MƒÅori.",text,9
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/05/30/life-of-farmed-salmon-in-nz/,"Only 0.7% of the world‚Äôs farmed salmon is Chinook and a single New Zealand-based company, King Salmon, produces over 50% of the world‚Äôs supply of this species. King Salmon farms over 8,000 tonnes of Chinook salmon annually, around 60% of which is eaten by the population of New Zealand.",text,10
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/05/30/life-of-farmed-salmon-in-nz/,"The scale of the Chinook salmon farming industry in New Zealand is hard to describe. Just as the population of humanity tells us nothing about an individual‚Äôs life, the numbers that show the vastness of this industry tell us nothing about the lives of the farmed Chinook salmon. Thus, to take a glimpse into what salmon farming in New Zealand is like,I will follow the life of a single Chinook salmon, Chinny. Her story represents the typical life of a farmed Chinook salmon in New Zealand.",text,11

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/05/30/life-of-farmed-salmon-in-nz/,"The first couple of months are relatively peaceful: there are no predators, the other Chinooks are not aggressive, and there is sufficient food. However, as she grows, Chinny starts to feel stressed. Chinook salmon are migratory andtheir instinct to migrate is strong enough for them to sometimes take life-threatening risks in an attempt to escape their cages.Chinny has nothing to compare her life to as no other world is familiar to her, but her instincts tell her that something is wrong.",text,15

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/05/30/life-of-farmed-salmon-in-nz/,"To achieve this staggering growth rate, Chinny is fed calorie-rich meat, but to maximise profits, King Salmon uses the cheapest meat they can find. They collect the by-products of land-animal slaughter in abattoirs (feathermeal from slaughtered chickens and bloodmeal from cattle, pigs, and sheep). While the salmon are marketed with various welfare certifications, the abattoir by-products come from farms with much lower standards. King Salmon also feeds the fish vegetable oils and vegetable-derived proteins as they are cheap sources of fats and protein.",text,24
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/05/30/life-of-farmed-salmon-in-nz/,"Chinook salmon are carnivorous which presents a number of issues to their farming. One such challenge is that huge numbers of fish are caught and fed to the Chinooks. These smaller fish can be caught with an even lower standard of welfare than the farmed salmon. Also, the catching of wild fish to feed farmed Chinooks depletes wild fish populations, which is one of the issues fish farming is supposed to tackle.",text,25
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/05/30/life-of-farmed-salmon-in-nz/,"Due to the high costs associated with catching wild fish mentioned earlier, only one-fifth of what King Salmon feeds the Chinooks consists of other fish (including fish oil).

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/05/30/life-of-farmed-salmon-in-nz/,"Due to this unnatural proportion of vegetable-based food, Chinny‚Äôs body would become a dull grey colour, as opposed to the bright pink that is characteristic of wild salmon. To prevent this, her food is supplemented with astaxanthin, a pigment that turns her flesh the usual pink that customers expect.",text,27

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/05/30/life-of-farmed-salmon-in-nz/,"Automatic feeding systems throw the food into the sea cages, allowing the fish to fight for it amongst themselves. Chinny, being a solitary animal by nature, finds this competition highly stressful. Many of the smaller Chinooks in the sea cage get bullied, killed, and eaten by larger individuals. Chinny must be cautious so she avoids the larger fish and lives with the sole intention of getting enough food to sustain herself.",text,30
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/05/30/life-of-farmed-salmon-in-nz/,"Chinny does not know it, but she has more space than some other farmed fish.  If she were on an Atlantic salmon farm overseas, she could be stocked in a sea cage at a density of 25 kg/m3. In these extremely cramped conditions, salmon often end up with sores and fin damage due to the constant knocking against each other that they endure.",text,31
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/05/30/life-of-farmed-salmon-in-nz/,"King Salmon‚Äôs farms are reportedly not stocked this densely although there is no way to know this as the standards do not specify a limit. The standards written by the fish farming industry itself, simply say that stocking density ‚Äúmust be maintained at a level that reduces the risk of physiological stress and minimises external damage to the fish‚Äù. Even these vague standards are not enforced. Instead, the regulators put their hope in ‚Äúgood faith‚Äù: ‚Äúfarmers will also be required to self-report their compliance with these New Zealand Farmed Salmon welfare standards.‚Äù",text,32

During the most recent summer alone, King Salmon dumped nearly1,300 tonnesof dead Chinook salmon and other waste. It is possible that the coming years will see greater mortality rates due to the salmon overheating. Those that do not die will have to endure highly uncomfortable sea temperatures which they are not adapted to.",text,45

The fish around her become aggressive in their desperation to eat.",text,49

The initial stress and increased aggression due to the lack of food have passed and now the fish all swim slowly and mechanically around the cage. Suddenly, on the eighth day without food, the fish in front of her change direction and begin frantically swimming towards her. As they swim past her she sees a large net being swept through the cage. She instinctively turns to swim away from this potential danger. As the fish attempt to escape the net, they are concentrated into one corner of the cage. Chinny becomes completely wedged between the others around her and, unable to see what is happening, feels the weight of her cage-mates pull her out of the water.",text,50

They will have been bred with the health of the bird in mind (instead of profit). They will be able to get off the dirty litter and rest on perches. These inquisitive birds will have objects to play with and things to investigate. They will be able to see the daylight (instead of the 20 hours of artificial light they currently have each day on farms) and experience longer periods of darkness so they can get sufficient sleep.,text,17

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/07/15/plant-based-diets-popularity/,"We are very used to hearing promising news from many different Western countries about how plant-based diets are becoming increasingly mainstream for ethical, environmental, and health reasons. At Animals Aotearoa, we proudly applaud these personal changes because they contribute to a shift away from the exploitative treatment of non-human animals that has become normalised in our society.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/07/15/plant-based-diets-popularity/,"Reducing meat consumptionhelps tackle climate changeandmitigate public health crises. This is especially important in a country like New Zealand where there is a strong culture of meat-based diets; the average meat consumption globally in 2009 was just under 42kg per person but, in New Zealand, it wascloser to 106kg per person. This cultural shift away from excessive meat consumption is no molehill but the general message we receive about people’s diets is that we’re heading, albeit rather slowly, in the right direction.",text,13
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/07/15/plant-based-diets-popularity/,"Surely, we can expect the findings of the NZAVS to mirror the optimistic messages about plant-based diets that we hear in the media? In fact, the researchers were surprised by the results – as were we.",text,14

Vegetarians and vegans, on the other hand, were less stable in their dietary choices: they had a 78.8% chance of remaining plant-based in a one-year period.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/07/15/plant-based-diets-popularity/,The animal agriculture industry is vast so it’s understandable why many people believe their individual actions won’t have a significant impact. This belief naturally translates to behaviour changes because the fundamental aim of veganism is to end the unnecessary suffering that humans cause to non-human animals so what is the point in making a dietary sacrifice if it won’t help achieve this goal?,text,23
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/07/15/plant-based-diets-popularity/,"While this position is a common and reasonable one, I believe it is simply not the case. It’s important to realise that people’s decision to eat plant-based food doesn’t just impact their own lives. Their actions inspire those around them: they may become role models for a way of living in accordance with the values of compassion and respect for animals that so many people share.

Advocating for plant-based diets is still very important but a massive change in the demand for animal products is not going to happen suddenly. We should explore other ways to eliminate the unnecessary suffering we cause to non-human animals and one of the most powerful ways to do this is to deal with the supply chain.,text,34

Shockingly, the vast majority of the chickens raised for meat in Aotearoa come from industrial farms that use chickens selectively bred to grow unnaturally fast, causing many avoidable health problems. Due to the unnatural breeding and terrible living conditions, every year at least 2,000,000 birds die in the sheds. Through the BCC, Animals Aotearoa is asking companies to commit to a set of minimum standards including asking companies to shift to breeds of chicken that grow more naturally.",text,8

As an example – abnormally fast-growing chickens have difficulty walking, that therefore impacts ‘free range’ access to the outside;  many chickens never actually get outside.

I started scuba diving at university in London and this really became my passion when I studied for a Masters in marine biology at Bangor University, in North Wales. Being able to hang in the water, watching the goings-on of a myriad of diverse creatures, from brightly coloured anemones draped over rocks, to camouflaged octopus wedged into corners, to tiny barnacles reaching out with what looks like grasping hands to catch food particles floating past.",text,7

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/08/31/five-fascinating-facts-about-fishes-2/,"Fishes learn to avoid situations they know will cause them pain, and will seek out experiences that give them rewards.",text,11
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/08/31/five-fascinating-facts-about-fishes-2/,"Some have developed clever ways of obtaining food. The archerfish, for example, catches prey out of the air above them by shooting a stream of water from their mouth, with the correct volume of water precisely calculated based on the target.",text,12
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/08/31/five-fascinating-facts-about-fishes-2/,"The use of tools was thought to be unique to humans, but many fishes get their food using rocks to crack open clams, oysters and mussels.",text,13
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/08/31/five-fascinating-facts-about-fishes-2/,"Fishes can also count. Astudyfound that cichlids and stingrays can add and subtract from one to five, and can distinguish between quantities of three and four.",text,14

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/08/31/five-fascinating-facts-about-fishes-2/,"Contrary to popular belief, fish do have great memories. The memory ability of fishes is clearly shown by the way that salmon find their way home. After years at sea, they use their sense of smell and memory of the stream they were born in, to navigate home.",text,17
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/08/31/five-fascinating-facts-about-fishes-2/,It’s well known that fishes in aquariums can recognise and remember the people who give them food rewards. Some also have been known to take a dislike to certain individuals they don’t like and spit water at them when they approach.,text,18
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/08/31/five-fascinating-facts-about-fishes-2/,"The frillfin goby is a small fish that lives on rocky shores. At low tide they hang out in rock pools, but if a predator approaches they will jump into an adjacent rock pool, accurately navigating without getting stranded out of the water. They do this by memorising the layout of the sea floor while swimming above it when the tide is high. Back in the 1940s,it was foundthey can memorise this after just one viewing, and remember the layout 40 days later.",text,19

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/08/31/five-fascinating-facts-about-fishes-2/,"Fishes form relationships both within their own species and with other species. They build complex social networks and communicate in a variety of ways including through body language, colour change and even vocally. Cod, for example, communicate with a series of vocalisations, thumps and growls made with their swim bladders, which they use as alarm calls, to attract mates and to establish territories. They have the ability to change the patterns of their sounds and use different frequencies, leading to afindingof regional accents with these fishes in the UK.",text,22
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/08/31/five-fascinating-facts-about-fishes-2/,"Astudyon a monogamous fish species that forms long-lasting pairs, the convict cichlid, demonstrated the emotional attachment to their partners. They found that when some fish lose their chosen mates, they become glum and more pessimistic.",text,23
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/08/31/five-fascinating-facts-about-fishes-2/,"Some species of fishes interact symbiotically with others by acting as cleaners for larger fish. The cleaner fish benefits by eating parasites off the larger fish, and the latter has less parasites. Other species work together to hunt food. Groupers and coral trout will send a visual signal to show the whereabouts of hidden prey. By cooperating, these two species catch more food than when hunting alone.",text,24

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/08/31/five-fascinating-facts-about-fishes-2/,Fishes are also highly sensitive to vibrations in the water. They use special sensory receptors along their body called the lateral line.,text,29
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/08/31/five-fascinating-facts-about-fishes-2/,"Salmon are able to return to the same river in which they were born, to spawn. They navigate using the earth’s magnetic fields and can detect the smell of their own home stream. This species can even detect chemicals down to one part per million.",text,30
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/08/31/five-fascinating-facts-about-fishes-2/,"There are so many qualities that fishes share with us, and many things they can do that we can’t. What we definitely share is the desire to be free from pain and suffering, and the New Zealand Animal Welfare Act recognises the sentience of fishes.",text,31

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/08/31/five-fascinating-facts-about-fishes-2/,"Coral reefs are well known for the huge number of vibrantly coloured fishes. Usually, those living deeper are less colourful, as it’s darker the deeper you go and being colourful is less important for communication at depth. The beautiful rose-veiled fairy wrasse pictured on the left above, however, wasdiscovered only fairly recentlyliving off the Maldives at depths ranging from 40 to 70 meters beneath the ocean’s surface.",text,34
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/08/31/five-fascinating-facts-about-fishes-2/,"But some have a face that perhaps only their mother could love, like the blobfish pictured on the right above. Thesmooth-head blobfish, also known simply as blobfish, is a deep-sea fish that inhabits the waters off the coasts of mainland Australia and Tasmania, as well as New Zealand. They live at depths between 600 and 1,200 m. Instead of flesh, the blobfish is primarily a gelatinous mass which allows the fish to float above the sea floor without expending energy on swimming. Blobfish are often caught as bycatch in bottom trawling nets.",text,35
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/08/31/five-fascinating-facts-about-fishes-2/,"Fishes are amazing animals, but they suffer appallingly due to the demand for fish and fish products. They are caught and often left to die a lingering death; their habitats are destroyed by destructive fishing methods; they are discarded as unwanted by-catch, and dumped back into the ocean.",text,36
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/08/31/five-fascinating-facts-about-fishes-2/,"Those trapped on fish farms experience similar physical and mental deprivations to factory-farmed land animals. This is especially relevant given that the salmon farmed in Aotearoa are stopped from migrating, and prevented from using their amazing memory, smell and navigational abilities.",text,37

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/09/28/meal-kits-animal-welfare/,"What is interesting about this industry, is that almost all of the companies that sell meat claim various high ethical standards – but provide very little detail on what this means. Unlike supermarkets and other retailers who sell a number of options, a meal kit only includes one type of any product and it seems that meal kits have decided the most popular product when it comes to chicken meat is free-range.",text,13
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/09/28/meal-kits-animal-welfare/,"I want to note here that many of these companies provide cage-free eggs and free-farmed pork. These are terms set by a third-party regulator, they are higher than minimum standard and have proven animal welfare benefits. This article is about the standards of chickens bred for meat.",text,14
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/09/28/meal-kits-animal-welfare/,"None of the biggest three meal kits claim to be using SPCA-Certified chicken meat. We can assume that HelloFresh, My Food Bag and Woop are all using the chicken industry’s self-written free-range standard.",text,15

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/09/28/meal-kits-animal-welfare/,"I will summarise the problems here quickly. Free-range is an unregulated term, so industries can claim whatever they want. When it comes to some animals (like hens farmed for their eggs) these standards are meaningful, but when it comes to chickens bred for meat these standards offer virtually no improvement.",text,17
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/09/28/meal-kits-animal-welfare/,"This is because all chicken meat, including free-range, comes from abnormally fast-growing breeds.These baby birds are been bred to grow faster than nature intended, being slaughtered at just six weeks old.",text,18
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2022/09/28/meal-kits-animal-welfare/,"To classify as free-range, the farmers must provide access to the outdoors. This comes in the form of small ‘pop-holes’ in the wall of the shed. They remain closed until about halfway through the birds’ life, while they develop feathers. Because of the unnatural breeding many of these chickens live in chronic pain, so even taking a few steps can be painful.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2023/02/02/free-range-chickens/,"New Zealand is known as a nation of animal lovers. Nearly two-thirds of us share our homes with cats, dogs or other companion animals. We grow to understand their likes and dislikes; even celebrating their distinct personalities, including repeatedly on our social media pages, or is that just me? These members of our families are accepted as the sentient beings they certainly are, experiencing excitement, boredom, joy, wanting to play and also wanting to rest and be alone.‚ÄãPerhaps because of this, shoppers are increasingly basing their buying decisions on the way animals farmed for meat and eggs have been treated. If you are one of these so-called conscious consumers, do you find yourself scanning the shelves for chicken meat and carefully examining labels, attempting to make the best choice?",text,7

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2023/02/02/free-range-chickens/,"Free range is a term often found on supermarket shelves, in the animal welfare policies of food businesses, and in recipe books.

Each windowless, dimly-lit shed houses around 40,000 chickens. As they grow, they are increasingly crammed together, with each having only about the space of an iPad.",text,11
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2023/02/02/free-range-chickens/,"These sheds are barren with nothing but food trays and water lines for the chickens to interact with.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2023/02/02/free-range-chickens/,"Chickens are very active and curious birds – quick to investigate new things. Much of their time is spent scratching the ground, looking for seeds and other tasty morsels. Something else they love is dustbathing. They find somewhere with loose earth and repeatedly kick soil over themselves. It‚Äôs a natural way to keep their skin healthy and they really enjoy it!",text,16

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2023/02/02/free-range-chickens/,"The chickens who are farmed for meat in New Zealand, called broiler chickens by the industry, come from one of two breeds – Cobb and Ross. Since the 1950s, these types of chickens have been aggressively selectively bred to maximise growth in the shortest possible time. They reach adult size in just a few weeks.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2023/02/02/free-range-chickens/,"In comparison, their bones and organs are very underdeveloped. This causes many birds to struggle to walk and some can‚Äôt even hold up their body weight. Many are in pain every step they take.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2023/02/02/free-range-chickens/,"The high number of chickens in each shed, is another reason that chickens on free range farms don‚Äôt get outside. Tens of thousands per shed is the norm on industrial free range farms. An individual bird may need to struggle past thousands of others to reach one of the ‚Äòpop-holes‚Äô in the shed wall. This means they may never get outside and instead, will live their entire lives squashed in a shed with so many other birds.",text,32
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2023/02/02/free-range-chickens/,"Those who do make it outside spend most of their time sitting, as their bodies are not designed to stand or walk easily.",text,33
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2023/02/02/free-range-chickens/,The chicken producers know that the way these so-called free range chickens live is far from what caring consumers want to see.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2023/02/02/free-range-chickens/,"Bostock keeps chickens in smaller flocks with an outdoor range in an apple orchard. This means the birds have lots of shelter, they can dustbathe and perform many other natural behaviours. These chickens are also managed in a way that causes them to grow slower and have a better quality of life, to be killed at eight to ten weeks old.",text,38

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2023/02/02/free-range-chickens/,"You might be wondering how this is allowed. There are no laws determining how free range chickens are farmed. In fact, it was the chicken industry that wrote its own free range standards.",text,43

Chickens bred for meat grow abnormally big and fast. In order to raise the parent birds to maturity so they can mate and produce birds for the market, the parent birds are kept constantly hungry. Mutilations are carried out on the roosters in an attempt to limit damage to the females during mating. This is animal abuse and it needs to stop.”",text,9
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2023/03/01/nz-animal-welfare-standards-efsa/,"The EFSA broiler (chickens reared for meat) report details the numerous ways chickens farmed for meat, including free range, suffer. The breeds used in New Zealand have been selectively bred to grow abnormally fast, causing many chickens to suffer chronic pain and lameness. The report details the need for breeds with more natural growth rates, more space per bird, and an enriched environment where the chickens can get off the floor onto perches or platforms, and be able to perform ‘comfort behaviours’ such as dustbathing and foraging.",text,10

This vague wording deliberately avoids the word “cage” on the packaging, and only tells shoppers the hens are in a group – a colony. Most people don’t realise the hens in question are confined to a colony cage, as it is unspecified.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2023/08/01/chicken-meat-alternatives/,"Operated at a mega-farm, industrial scale, chickens bred for meat in New Zealand have miserable, short lives,even on so-called ‘free-range’ farms. These talkative, curious, smart birds are genetically selected to grow unnaturally fast, too quick for their own bodies to cope. Their organs, bones and leg muscles strain to keep up. Many become too swollen and in pain to even walk more than a few steps. The chickens are denied many natural behaviours, deprived of enough personal space and many are trapped indoors their whole lives, never to see the sky until they’re off to slaughter. Most animal-loving Kiwis are appalled tolearn the hidden reality of chicken farming in New Zealand. There’s nothing comforting about the big chicken industry.",text,12

Higher levels of ‘bad cholesterol’ (LDL cholesterol), as well as carcinogens and pathogens found in chicken meat all increase the risk of heart disease, certain cancers, urinary tract infections and foodborne illnesses.",text,13

Compared to 400g of chicken breast costs between $7 – $10.  Convenience chicken alternatives are a mix of comparable and more expensive.

When food businesses sign up the Commitment, they specify theagreed future deadlineby which all the chicken they use will meet the Better Chicken Commitment standards. Over 500, companies here and overseas have signed up to the Better Chicken Commitment.It’s not just Campfire Treats and Beco Pets leading the charge. Viva Raw, Savage Cat Food, RAWR and Beast Feast are also committed to the Better Chicken Commitment, working towards meeting all the criteria by 2028, 2027, 2026 and 2024 respectively.

The new coalition Government will feature New Zealand First, who was previously opposed to live export, together with National and Act who said they will repeal the ban ifthey can find a way to protect animal welfare and safety(which seems unlikely on the aptly nick named “death ships”).

The ship left with 58,000 sheep intended for Saudi Arabia. However, Saudi Arabia rejected the ship on arrival as they alleged disease was evident in the sheep. A mechanical breakdown then led to a fire on the ship. After 79 days on board the ship, the sheep were unloaded in Eritrea and by then, 6,000 were dead.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,"When chickens are trucked to the slaughterhouse, they arrive in plastic crates. They are dragged out and metal shackles are clamped around their legs to attach them to a hanging conveyor belt. The shackles bite into their legs, causing pain, especially for larger chickens. Chickens have pain receptors in their legs, and studies show the shackling process causes bruising to thigh muscles and damage to their legs. Some birds are already in pain from having legs or wings broken, or joints dislocated, during the catching and transport process.",text,11
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,"Being hung upside down by their feet is extremely distressing for any animal, but especially for chickens because, unlike humans, they don’t have a diaphragm. This means that when hung upside down, their lungs and heart are crushed by their other internal organs.",text,12
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,How are chickens stunned at the slaughterhouse?,text,13
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,The method used for stunning in New Zealand is called waterbath stunning. The waterbath is a vat of water with an electric current running through it. The idea is that the birds’ heads are dragged through the water and a current runs from their heads to their feet in the metal shackles.,text,14
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,"The chickens are flapping around in their distress from being hung in the shackles, so their wings can enter the water before their heads, which gives them a painful pre-shock.",text,15
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,"The waterbath fails to stun some of the chickens. Birds may not be properly stunned because they raise their heads and miss the water, or the electric current could be too low to cause unconsciousness, especially for some larger birds. Instead, they are just immobilised, which means they are fully conscious but can’t move. They can still feel pain when their throats are cut. Even a small failure rate means potentially thousands of individuals having their throats cut while fully conscious.",text,16
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,"After stunning, the birds have their throats slit and then their body is dragged through a vat of hot water. The automated neck-cutting machine fails to kill some birds. This is because some are larger or smaller than the average size, so instead they are slashed across their breast or head. They miss a lethal neck cut so are plunged fully conscious into a vat of hot water – the scalding tank.",text,17
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,"A worker stands by the shackle line with the job of cutting the throats of any birds that haven’t been stunned, but with the large number of birds that pass them, each minute, it’s very difficult for them to ensure they don’t miss any of the birds.",text,18
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,"Birds that are missed by the workers, will drown after feeling the sensation of the burning water. It’s horrific and the slaughter plants know it’s happening because the birds come out bright red!",text,19
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,"By law, all chickens in New Zealand are supposed to be stunned before they are killed, butthe failure of waterbath stunning to cause all chickens to become unconscious means that this law is repeatedly being broken.",text,20
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,What are the alternatives to waterbath stunning?,text,21
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,"The most commonly adopted alternative to stunning chickens with an electrified waterbath is controlled atmospheric stunning (CAS), sometimes also called controlled atmosphere stunning. The crates of chickens are passed through a chamber containing gas or gases, on a conveyor belt. At the other end, the dead birds are hung on a shackle line.CAS involves stunning chickens with gas, either carbon dioxide or inert gases (nitrogen or argon). Where carbon dioxide is used, the process needs to be carried out in at least two stages, in the first the concentration of carbon dioxide needs to be less than 30% (according to the New Zealand Slaughter Code of Welfare), to reduce the feeling of suffocation, and once they are unconscious, a higher concentration can be used.",text,22
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,Why is CAS a preferred method for stunning chickens?,text,23
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,"CAS reduces much of the suffering involved in live shackle waterbath stunning.The chickens remain in the crates, so they are not handled. This reduces stress and fear, and removes the pain of having their legs clamped into metal shackles.",text,24
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,Is gas stunning available in New Zealand?,text,25
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,"CAS (gas stunning) is not available in New Zealand, but it is used at some chicken slaughterhouses in Australia using carbon dioxide, but not with inert gases. CAS does not meet the New Zealand requirements for halal slaughter which currently all chicken meat in New Zealand is produced to.",text,26
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,"CAS is commonly used for stunning chickens overseas, especially in the UK, Europe and the US. In the UK, for example, 85% of the 1.1 billion chickens killed per year are stunned using CAS.",text,27

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,"A relatively recent development for stunning chickens is called LAPS, which stands for Low Atmospheric Pressure Stunning. In a LAPS system, chickens are kept in their transport crates and placed in a sealed chamber, and the atmospheric pressure is gradually reduced using controlled slow decompression with a vacuum pump. This results in the gradual removal of oxygen in the air thereby causing unconsciousness and death by lack of oxygen.",text,29

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,"The way chickens are killed isn’t just bad for the birds themselves, slaughterhouses (also called freezing works or abattoirs), are also very unpleasant places for people to work and tend to have a high staff turnover.",text,33
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,"A slaughterhouse is a very stressful environment for the workers. They work in the stench of blood and guts, and the fast-moving machinery can lead to injuries. The fast movement of the shackle line means many birds pass by each minute, which is why those charged with killing the birds who fail to be stunned effectively, miss some who end up boiled alive in the scalding tank.",text,34
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,"CASandLAPSstunning are less unpleasant for the workers than live shackle waterbath stunning, as the workers do not have to handle frightened, squirming birds who can peck and scratch. They only have to handle dead birds.",text,35

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/03/20/how-chickens-are-killed/,100 per cent of commercial slaughter of chickens in New Zealand is to meet halal standards.

Sadly ‘oldest’ when it comes to chickens bred for meat is just six years. Her body was designed to grow meat, rather than sustain life and as a result, she is about twice as large as her egg-laying sisters and needs regular veterinary attention.Pou has been on heart medication for many years, and her biological clock is ticking fast.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/07/17/kfc-nandos-europe-progress-nz-failing/,Today a report by theOpen Wing Alliancehas been released detailing progress in Europe on theBetter Chicken Commitment(BCC).The good news is that 378 companies have signed to meet the higher welfare standards of the European BCC. These commitments cover 1.1 billion chickens and are already positively impacting 230 million chickens right now with more to be impacted as future deadlines approach. The companies that have signed in Europe include Nando’s and KFC. They have recognised the need to make crucial improvements in the lives of the chickens they sell.,text,7

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/07/17/kfc-nandos-europe-progress-nz-failing/,"We’re calling out Nando’s and KFC for their lack of progress in Oceania. This is the second report released in the last month to highlight that these Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs) are serving lower-welfare chicken meat to their customers here and across the ditch, compared with in Europe.",text,9
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/07/17/kfc-nandos-europe-progress-nz-failing/,"Marianne Macdonald, Executive Director of Animals Aotearoa, says that change is urgently needed over this side of the world.",text,10
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/07/17/kfc-nandos-europe-progress-nz-failing/,"“Currently in New Zealand, the breeds of chickens used for meat grow so big and so fast that many suffer chronic pain and lameness. Some can’t lift their bodies up off the floor to reach food or water. Others struggle to breathe or suffer organ failure within weeks of being hatched. All because they’ve been bred to grow faster than nature intended. Not only is this terrible for animals, it is also short-changing consumers in this part of the world.”",text,11
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/07/17/kfc-nandos-europe-progress-nz-failing/,"TheBCCis a science-based, six-point corporate Environmental, Social and Governance policy, aiming to mitigate the severe suffering associated with intensive meat chicken farming practices. It addresses critical welfare issues for chickens raised for meat, including unnaturally fast growth rates, lack of enrichment, and high stocking densities.Both KFC and Nando’s have signed the BCC in the UK and Ireland, but have failed to do the same in New Zealand and Australia.Jenny Packwood, Head of Brand Engagement, KFC UK & Irelandrecognises that their customers care about chicken welfare.",text,12

Our customers rightly want and expect the chicken we serve to be good quality and reared with care. So we’re committed to working towards best practice and improving the welfare of every single chicken across all of our suppliers. Whether it’s creating more space in barns, moving towards slower-growing breeds or implementing stricter auditing processes, we’re leaving no stone unturned in our journey towards improvement. ”",text,13
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/07/17/kfc-nandos-europe-progress-nz-failing/,"In Aotearoa, we’re at the start of this journey, with seven businesses signed up to the BCC; in Australia, the total is three. And while the three largest chicken producers in Europe are signed up to the commitment,none of those in New Zealand and Australia, including the biggest three, Tegel, Ingham’s, and Baiada, have yet done so.",text,14
https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/07/17/kfc-nandos-europe-progress-nz-failing/,"The falling behind in standards is reiterated by the findings of World Animal Protection’s recent report,Fast Food, Slow Progress, on QSRs and their chicken welfare policies in Australia compared with overseas. It reiterates how standards here are falling behind Europe.Back in 2021,Nando’s UK & Ireland Product Director, Judith Irons, said about her company having signed up to the higher welfare standards of the Better Chicken Commitment,",text,15

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2024/07/17/kfc-nandos-europe-progress-nz-failing/,"“These reports show us, not just the future of the chicken market, but the BCC is quickly becoming the benchmark. It is embarrassing to see New Zealand and Australia falling behind when we have a reputation for good animal welfare. Chicken producers and food businesses can pay attention and transition towards this progress, or continue with outdated sub-par practices which cause severe chicken suffering and fail to meet consumer expectations. We are being shown the inevitable, let’s act on it.”",text,19

https://animalsaotearoa.org/about-us/about-us/,"Despite sentience being legally recognised, the treatment and exploitation of animals do not reflect this.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/about-us/who-is-animals-aotearoa/animalsaotearoa.org/about-us/about-us/,"The Animal Welfare Act (1999) recognises that animals are sentient.

These can be negative (such as pain or boredom) as well as positive (such as pleasure or comfort).",text,18
https://animalsaotearoa.org/about-us/who-is-animals-aotearoa/animalsaotearoa.org/about-us/about-us/,"Despite sentience being legally recognised, the treatment and exploitation of animals do not reflect this. Animals are used in many ways, for example, reared for food and clothing, experimented on in laboratories, hunted, used in racing and rodeos for entertainment, and exterminated when labelled as ‘pests’.",text,19

https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/bcc-nz-standards-comparison/,The Better Chicken Commitment is the leading set of science-based standards for chicken welfare. It was originally developed by 30 animal welfare organisations as a set of standards to address the biggest causes of suffering on chicken farms where chickens are reared for meat.,text,8
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/bcc-nz-standards-comparison/,"TheAustralia-New Zealand Better Chicken Commitment(ANZ BCC) has been developed by Animals Aotearoa, SPCA NZ, Compassion in World Farming and The Humane League to meet the needs of our local context. It is supported by 15 animal organisations including Veterinarians for Animal Welfare Aotearoa and World Animal Protection.",text,9
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/bcc-nz-standards-comparison/,"We are often asked how the ANZ BCC compares with the currentminimum standardsfor chickens, which were written by the National Animal Welfare Committee (NAWAC) and found in theCode of Welfare (Meat Chickens)and theCode of Welfare (Commercial Slaughter).",text,10
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/bcc-nz-standards-comparison/,"The Codes outlineminimum standardsthat are considered the minimum necessary to meet the Animal Welfare Act. They also outline someRecommended Best Practices.Many of these best practices are in line with the ANZ BCC, as you can see in the table below. Over time, in most areas of animal welfare, the recommended best practices get lifted to minimum standards when codes are reviewed.",text,11
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/bcc-nz-standards-comparison/,The Code of Welfare for chickens bred for meat was initially drafted in 2012 and republished in 2018 (without a review). The Government has said a full review will be starting in 2023.,text,12
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/bcc-nz-standards-comparison/,We are also often asked how the ANZ BCC compares to the New Zealand free-range standards. It is important to note thatthere is no legal definition of free-range in New Zealandso we have also compared the ANZ BCC standards to the Poultry Industry Association of New Zealand’sfree-range standards for meat chickens.,text,13
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/bcc-nz-standards-comparison/,"The ANZ BCC is an improvement upon both the current minimum standards and the industry free-range standards for chickens bred for meat. However, many of the ANZ BCC standards match NAWAC’s recommended best practices. The main difference of the ANZ BCC is a restriction on the abnormally fast-growing breeds used, in favour of healthier breeds who grow more naturally.",text,14

https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/better-chicken-commitment/,"The white chickens currently used in New Zealand for meat production (called ‘broilers’ by the poultry industry) are of one of two breeds – Cobb and Ross. They have been selected to grow ‘meat’ not sustain life. They double in size every week. They are usually killed at justsix weeks of age, although some are slaughtered as early as four weeks old.",text,11
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/better-chicken-commitment/,"The fast growth leads to a range of severe welfare problems. Their musculoskeletal structures fail to keep up with the increase in weight. Up to a third struggle to walk due to painful lameness. Their under-developed organs can cause respiratory difficulties, heart disease and heart failure – a very stressful way to die.",text,12

https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/better-chicken-commitment/,"While these breeds of chickens have been aggressively selectively bred to grow fast, they still have the same natural instincts as other chickens.",text,16
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/better-chicken-commitment/,"As well as the need for suitable food and clean water, they need space to spread their wings and run around. They are curious and seek the opportunity to forage, peck at objects and scratch.",text,17
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/better-chicken-commitment/,"They like to perch off the ground, especially when sleeping, to avoid predators. They keep their skin and feathers healthy by dust bathing. They also need a daily rhythm of light and dark to encourage natural behaviour and rest.",text,18

https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/better-chicken-commitment/,"TheBetter Chicken Commitment(BCC) specifies the improvements needed across the food industry to give chickens bred for meat lives worth living.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/frequently-asked-questions/,How do I reach the standards of the BCC?,text,14
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/frequently-asked-questions/,Every business’ deadline and roadmap to change could look a little different. Your roadmap may include things such as:,text,15
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/frequently-asked-questions/,My chicken supply is SPCA Certified. Does that meet BCC standards?,text,16
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/frequently-asked-questions/,"SPCA NZendorses the Australia-New Zealand BCC.

Food businesses signing the BCC provides increased demand for chicken producers to make these changes.",text,17
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/frequently-asked-questions/,What suppliers are certified to the BCC standards?,text,18
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/frequently-asked-questions/,"The BCC standards are internationally recognised and can be certified by any recognised auditor. Suppliers will need to work towards the standards of the BCC over the coming years and, as such, no suppliers in NZ are yet to meet the full BCC requirements.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/frequently-asked-questions/,"The chicken industry makes decisions regarding profitability. The science on welfare outcomes for the chickens themselves has been a low priority to industry.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/frequently-asked-questions/,What about halal slaughter?,text,34
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/frequently-asked-questions/,"When chickens are slaughtered to meet halal standards, (often for the export market), there are restrictions on the type of stunning. Halal usually requires that the chickens have the capacity to recover from the stun, so Controlled Atmospheric Stunning (gas) may not be acceptable.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/frequently-asked-questions/,How does the Australia-New Zealand regional BCC differ from the European and North American/Canadian versions?,text,37
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/frequently-asked-questions/,"To allow food brands to find a date that works for them, the regional version doesn’t have a set deadline of 2026 (Europe) or 2024 (US/Canada) for full implementation. The specific deadline for full compliance with the BCC is agreed upon with each food business before they announce their BCC commitment publicly.The Australia-NZ BCC allows for new breeds to be tested by the RSPCA UK and additional testing bodies validated by the Better Chicken Commitment, allowing more flexibility to undertake welfare testing of new breeds.The Australia-New Zealand BCC includes a requirement for six hours of darkness, with four hours of it being continuous, in a 24-hour rhythm. This is already covered by laws in other regions but not in New Zealand.",text,38

https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/science-behind-the-bcc/,"In 2020, animal welfare scientists K Hartcher and H Lum performed a scientific literature review, where the authors summarise peer-reviewed scientific research publications looking at the welfare consequences of genetic selection of chickens bred for meat.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/science-behind-the-bcc/,"The authors concluded that “Breeding goals in the broiler industry over the past 60 years have generally narrowly focused on production traits, leading to several welfare problems” and that “Two of the most serious welfare problems in the broiler industry – feed restriction in breeders and health issues in broilers grown for meat – are directly linked to genetic selection”.",text,16

https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/science-behind-the-bcc/,Olkowski (2007) did extensive research into the underlying mechanisms of heart disease in meat chickens. They found that meat chickens were much more likely to have a cardiac arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) with up to 27% of fast grow birds having arrhythmias but only around 1% of slower-growing birds. They also found that fast-growing birds have lower oxygen blood concentrations and higher carbon dioxide blood concentrations than slower-growing birds. Post mortem examinations of apparently healthy fast-growing meat chickens revealed that many apparently healthy birds have subclinical heart disease.,text,19
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/science-behind-the-bcc/,"Findings on post mortem included weakening and thinning of the muscle of the ventricles (heart chambers), degeneration of the left atrio-ventricular valve (a valve between two of the heart chambers), and changes to the pericardium (the thin sac around the heart) that include a build-up of fluid in the sac, thickening of the sac, and adhesions between the sac and the outer wall of the heart. Additionally, the authors found that the heart rate of fast-growing birds was lower than that of slower-growing birds.",text,20
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/science-behind-the-bcc/,"Zhang, Schmidt, and Lamont (2018) looked at the genetic basis for heart disease in modern fast-growing chickens (breed Ross 708) and a slower-growing meat chicken (Illinois broiler). They found 321 genes that were expressed significantly differently between the two breeds by day 6, which increased to 819 genes by day 21. The fast-growing chickens had changes to their lipid (fat) transport genes. The study authors suggest that cell damage and inhibition of normal cell function results from these genetic changes and may be the cause of heart disease seen in these birds. Additionally, the authors found that the fast-growing birds had proportionally smaller hearts than the slower-growing chickens.",text,21

Wijesurendra and other authors (2017) examined birds that had died or been culled from 20 commercial meat chicken farms in Australia and found that 28% of these had signs of BCO. Wideman and others (2014) showed that there is a genetic predisposition for fast-growing meat chickens to develop BCO, and in 2013, these authors showed that fast-growing meat chickens were more likely to develop BCO than slower-growing meat breeds.",text,25
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/science-behind-the-bcc/,"There is also a genetic basis for other bone and leg deformities in fast-growing meat chickens.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/science-behind-the-bcc/,In 1992 Kestin and others developed a six-point gait scoring system which is commonly used to assess walking ability in broilers. Zero is a normal gait and five describes a bird that cannot stand or walk. This gait scoring system is used in the New Zealand Code of Welfare for Meat Chickens to assess walking ability. The Code recommends that all chickens with a gait score of 4 or 5 are culled.,text,30

Many studies have been conducted looking at how common gait scores of three or more are, these have ranged from 5.5% to 55%. The most recent study conducted in Aotearoa by the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) was in 2013, and found that in all weight categories just over 30% of birds had a gait score of three or more, and in heavier birds (2.9-3.6kg) this was almost 56%.",text,31

https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/science-behind-the-bcc/,"Because of all the health issues that result from fast growth, and the strong genetic drive for this in modern chickens bred for meat, there exists a significant welfare issue called the ‘broiler breeder paradox’. Broiler breeders are the parents, grandparents, or great grandparents of the birds that are reared to be eaten.",text,40
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/science-behind-the-bcc/,"Broiler breeders have the same genetics as their offspring, but they need to survive much longer so they can lay fertile eggs. To reduce the health issues these birds face, and to improve their reproductive performance, they are severely and consistently feed restricted, often being given only a third of what they would choose to consume. This leads to severe chronic hunger, frustration, boredom, chronic stress, aggression and abnormal behaviours.",text,41
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/science-behind-the-bcc/,"This ‘broiler breeder paradox’ has come about directly because of genetic selection. If the birds were allowed to eat as much as they feel they need to they will develop health issues, but if they have their food intake restricted they have other significant welfare issues.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/science-behind-the-bcc/,"The Cumulative Pain Framework translates evidence on the duration and intensity of the pain associated with growth rate, into time spent in four categories of pain intensity: Annoying, Hurtful, Disabling, and Excruciating.

https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/science-behind-the-bcc/,The results strongly support that adoption of BCC standards and slower-growing broiler strains have a net positive effect on the welfare of broiler chickens.,text,80
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/science-behind-the-bcc/,"Because most suffering of broiler chickens is strongly associated with fast growth, adoption of slower-growing breeds not only reduces the incidence of suffering, but also delays the onset of suffering.As a consequence, slower-growing birds are expected to experience a shorter time in pain before being slaughtered.",text,81
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/science-behind-the-bcc/,"Adoption of the Better Chicken Commitment, with the use of a slower-growing breed reaching a slaughter weight of approximately 2.5 Kg at 56 days (average daily weight gain of 45-46 g/day) is expected to prevent at least 33 hours of Disabling pain, 79 hours of Hurtful and 25 seconds of Excruciating pain for every bird affected by this intervention (only hours awake are considered).These figures correspond to approximately 66%, 24% and 78% reduction, respectively, in the time experienced in Disabling, Hurtful and Excruciating painrelative to a conventional scenario due to lameness, cardiopulmonary disorders, behavioural deprivation and thermal stress.",text,82
https://animalsaotearoa.org/for-businesses/science-behind-the-bcc/,"Adoption of slower-growing birds reaching a similar slaughter weight as conventional breeds is also likely to lead to a reduction in the number of individuals needed to produce the same amount of meatgiven reduced losses from mortality, as well as from disposal and rejection of carcasses and meat products (e.g. lower incidence of muscle myopathies) at the production and consumer sides.Although the adoption of better management practices – including lower stocking density, longer resting times and the provision of enrichment – is beneficial and desirable for improving broiler welfare,their impact is limited if the negative welfare effects inherently associated with the genetics for fast growth are not addressed.",text,83

For example, chickens want space to run and flap their wings. They are very curious, enjoying foraging, pecking at objects and scratching the ground. They naturally dustbathe to keep their skin healthy and like to perch up high, especially at night. So many of these behaviours are denied them in barren factory farm shed with a body designed to grow ‘meat’ not sustain life.",text,16

https://animalsaotearoa.org/take-action/delivering-better,The painful truth,text,14
https://animalsaotearoa.org/take-action/delivering-better,"Shockingly, the vast majority of the chickens raised for meat in Aotearoa come from industrial farms that use chickens selectively bred to grow unnaturally fast, reaching a size larger than a natural adult chicken in just six weeks.Because of their abnormally fast-growth, these birds face many avoidable health problems such as heart disease and lameness.Due to the unnatural breeding and terrible living conditions, every year around 2,000,000 birds die before they reach slaughter at six weeks  – either on the shed floor, or removed and killed by a worker. This is according to the industry’s own figures.They are packed into sheds so tightly that, at the end of their life, they are left with roughly the size of an A4 page to exist in. The litter is never changed in their short lives, forcing them to live in their own excrement – ammonia fills the air and with legs that struggle to hold their weight, they often suffer from burns to their skin from the excrement left on the ground.",text,15

https://animalsaotearoa.org/take-action/unfiltered-truth/,New Zealanders care about animal welfare. A recent poll showed that 90% of Kiwis place importance on protecting the welfare of farmed animals.1,text,14
https://animalsaotearoa.org/take-action/unfiltered-truth/,"Many food brands take this position seriously, responding to the expectations of Kiwis when it comes to animal welfare, including The Coffee Club, Columbus Coffee, HelloFresh and Domino’s. Overseas, 29 café chains have done the same. They’re all demanding for chicken meat standards to be improved by their suppliers, putting specific, measurable standards in place.",text,15
https://animalsaotearoa.org/take-action/unfiltered-truth/,"The reality of chicken farming is distressing. Barren sheds house 40,000 or more chickens, dumped there at just a day old. The birds have been selectively bred to grow unnaturally fast, doubling in size every week, to be slaughtered at just six weeks old. These breeds of chickens grow so big and so fast that many suffer chronic pain and lameness. Some can’t lift their bodies up off the floor to reach food or water. Others struggle to breathe or suffer organ failure within weeks of being hatched.All because they’ve been bred to grow faster than nature intended. They live in squalor, amidst their own waste and that of thousands of other birds.",text,16
