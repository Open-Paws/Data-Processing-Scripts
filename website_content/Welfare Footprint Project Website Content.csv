Therefore, different from proteins, there is no dataset of known correspondences that can be used by deep learning models. ",text,1
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/06/25/ai-mapping-suffering/,"However, a method to estimate the key elements of affective experiences – duration and intensity –  has been recently made available through the development of the Welfare Footprint Framework (WFF). Over the last few years, the WFF has been used to estimate the welfare impact of animal welfare reforms and interventions in different species. Although originally developed for use by researchers, the WFF is nevertheless highly suitable for use by AI, specifically in Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT series, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, and Meta’s LLaMA.",text,2
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/06/25/ai-mapping-suffering/,"One particularly critical part of this process, where the WFF made its major contribution, is in the description and quantification of affective states. This is explained in more detail elsewhere, but in short, the method for describing negative experiences is performed with the Pain-Track (Fig. 2) and follows two basic stages:",text,3
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/06/25/ai-mapping-suffering/,"Breaking Down the Experience: because the intensity of most experiences fluctuates over time (e.g., it may increase as a disease advances, or reduce as healing progresses), each experience is divided into meaningful time segments, each representing an expected intensity pattern. For example, the pain from stubbing a toe starts with sharp, immediate pain lasting seconds, followed by acute pain with swelling, lasting minutes. This continues through secondary pain and bruising (minutes to hours), subacute pain and healing (hours to days), and mild residual pain during recovery. This approach can be applied to any unpleasant experience, such as disease, injury, fear, frustration, or hunger. ",text,4
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/06/25/ai-mapping-suffering/,"Estimating Intensity and Duration during each Segment: for each temporal segment, the intensity of the negative experience is estimated, ranging from Annoying to Excruciating. To transform scattered knowledge from various fields into estimates within each cell in the Pain-Track, the WFF uses a structured approach that documents existing evidence and highlights how well it supports or contradicts each intensity hypothesis. For example, to estimate the intensity of pain a make piglet endures during surgical castration, a procedure whereby piglets are restrained, the scrotum incised with a scalpel, and the testes extracted by tearing the tissues or severing the spermatic cord, the experience is first divided into meaningful time segments. Next, all relevant information is gathered from the literature. This includes, among others, data on nociceptor densities in this tissue, the animal’s behavior, posture and vocalizations during and after the process, neurological and physiological responses, the characterization and typical duration of inflammatory processes, the type and dose of analgesics required to alleviate pain, and the evolutionary significance of pain for the animal and in the area affected. Each of these lines of evidence is then compared with the definitions of the four categories of pain intensity used in the WFF to estimate the intensity and duration of the experience in each of these specific moments. Once estimates of the intensity and duration of the experience are made for each time segment of a Pain-Track, calculating welfare loss, measured as Cumulative Time in Pain of different intensities (or Cumulative Pain for short), is straightforward and automatic. ",text,5
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/06/25/ai-mapping-suffering/,"Since discovering the powerful capabilities of LLMs to gather and interpret large volumes of data, we have been exploring their potential, particularly in creating Pain-Tracks. One outcome of this exploration is the ‘Pain-Track’ Custom GPT. This tool provides a starting point for describing and quantifying the impact of various welfare issues across species. In the video below, you can see an example of its operation, where the user simply confirmed each step by answering ‘yes’. However, interactions can be much more detailed (see the section ‘Tips for Using the Pain-Track Custom GPT’ further down in this text).",text,6

We found it particularly useful for didactic purposes, incorporating it into our workshops as a way to engage participants in the understanding and use of the Welfare Footprint method. Participants are motivated by being able to immediately describe and quantify sources of suffering in their target species or even for their personal pain experiences.",text,7
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/06/25/ai-mapping-suffering/,"While the results of the tool should only be interpreted as a starting point of analysis, which still requires human revision, estimates of Cumulative Pain produced so far are promising.

https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/06/25/ai-mapping-suffering/,"Still, LLMs are not deterministic, so estimates vary across queries. In the example above, 3 out of 10 individual estimates of Excruciating pain, and 5 (out of 10) individual estimates of Disabling pain did not overlap with those produced by the researchers, despite being in the same ‘ballpark’. Therefore, if the outputs of this GPT tool are aimed at informing decision-making, we advise using the average of about 10 queries, in the same way that human-based estimates are typically the consensus of various researchers.",text,9

https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"To inform efforts for the prevention and alleviation of animal suffering, the Welfare Footprint Project has so far primarily focused on quantifying negative affective experiences  [1], often referred to simply as ‘pain.’ This emphasis is based on the understanding that negative experiences generally have a greater impact on well-being than positive ones, often preventing the experience of positive states  [2]. From an evolutionary standpoint, pain is expected to be more noticeable than pleasure, as pain signals immediate threats to survival and reproduction, whereas positive experiences tend to reinforce behaviors that are beneficial in the medium term, like social bonding, learning, optimal foraging and mating. Failing to experience pleasure is not as immediately consequential as not responding to pain. This tendency to focus more on negative than positive events, known as negativity bias, is in fact a well-documented phenomenon in humans  [3].",text,1
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"Still, positive states also play a crucial role in shaping an individual’s quality of life, and determining the extent to which it is ‘good’ [4], or at least ‘worth living’ [5]. Positive states are not only momentarily pleasurable; they also have long-term effects that help  individuals overcome adversity [6]. For example, experiences of positive affect have been shown to naturally relieve pain (through endogenous analgesia), boost resilience to stress, and improve immune function [7–9]. Accordingly, the assessment of positive affect and the identification of conditions promoting it have gained substantial traction in the animal welfare sciences in recent years [10–12]. ",text,2
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"The goal of this contribution is to expand the Welfare Footprint framework to include not only the measurement of negative experiences in animals, but also positive states, or ‘pleasure’. Since the reasoning behind this metric is similar to that for assessing pain — already discussed in prior works [1,13] (see a 8 min video or a presentation at the Effective Altruism conference) — we do not describe these principles again here. Instead, we introduce the definitions and tools equivalent to those used for the quantification of negative affective states, now adapted for positive affect: the operational definitions of ‘pleasure’ and its four different intensity levels, the ‘Pleasure-Track’ notation system, and the ‘Cumulative Pleasure’. Additionally, with the full spectrum of affective experiences considered,  we also introduce a visualization proposal, termed ‘Cumulative Affect’, to represent the overall Welfare Footprint of any population in a context and time scope of interest.",text,3
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"We propose an operational definition of pleasure directly derived from the operational definition of pain previously proposed [14], as follows:",text,4
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"“Pleasure is a conscious experience, evolved to elicit or reinforce behaviors beneficial to an organism’s survival and/or reproduction. It is affectively and cognitively processed as a positive and dynamic sensation that can vary in intensity, duration, texture, spatial specificity, and anatomical location. Pleasure is characterized as ‘physical’ when primarily triggered by stimuli that are directly rewarding or enjoyable, and as ‘psychological’ when triggered by cognitive processes, memories, and emotional states. Depending on its intensity and duration, pleasure can override other adaptive instincts and motivational drives, leading to states of dependency and self-damage.”",text,5
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"In the Welfare Footprint Framework, pain intensity categories are operationally defined based on the assumption that more unpleasant sensations should be more disruptive, engaging a greater share of attention. [15,16].  This is rooted in the evolutionary expectation that the greater the threat, the more intense the signal should be to ensure it is prioritized over other functions and behaviors [17,18]. A similar approach can be used to define categories of pleasure intensity, with intensity categories defined based on the degree of engagement with positive experiences. First, the degree of engagement in experiences is likely to correspond to the hedonic value of these experiences [6]. A greater motivation to play, interact socially and explore is likely driven by a more intense positive experience. Second, the degree of motivation to engage in positive experiences is also likely to match their broader adaptive value [19]. Just as pain intensity often signals threat severity, pleasure intensity may correlate with the evolutionary importance of the activity, such as resource holding, learning, parental care, and mating (though maladaptive exceptions can be present, such as addiction in humans and feather-plucking in birds).",text,6
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"Similarly with the case of pain, here we propose the use of emphatic and universally recognized terms, focusing on concepts that reflect the degree of engagement with the pleasurable state. The definitions of pain intensities were first presented in a paper aimed at the medical audience [13], but designed to maintain their universality for non-human animals. This same broad approach is used to define pleasure intensities:",text,7
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"Just as we recently included the category ‘no pain’ as an additional intensity level (zero pain), it is also convenient, whenever relevant, to include the category ‘no pleasure,’ which represents the hypothesis that no positive affective states are experienced over the period of interest. ",text,8
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"The Pleasure-Track is a notation system analogous to the Pain-Track [13], where hypotheses on the temporal evolution and intensity of positive affective states are described. To this end, each experience is atomized into a level of analysis that is justifiable through empirical evidence. This is done by decomposing each experience into meaningful time segments, where each time segment is characterized by an expected intensity. Next, hypotheses about the intensity and duration of the experience at each of these segments can be informed by empirical evidence.  ",text,9
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"To illustrate the concept of a Pleasure-Track, we consider the hypothetical intensity and duration of play bouts in young calves, as follows: (Phase I) the play session begins with calves engaging in light play or exploration. This includes behaviors such as gently nudging or sniffing play objects, or light social interactions with other calves. The engagement is present but not overwhelming, allowing the calves to remain aware of their surroundings and easily shift their focus to other stimuli. As the play behavior escalates (Phase II), calves enter a state characterized by more vigorous activities such as running, jumping, and robust social play like head-butting or chasing. The calves show a clear focus on these rewarding activities, with their behavior directed towards maintaining or enhancing the experience. Physiological indicators might include increased heart rate or more expressive body language, reflecting their engagement in the play. The peak of the play experience (Phase III) is where the activity becomes the primary focus of the calves’ attention, with calves fully immersed in play, displaying spontaneous expressions of pleasure such as vocalizations or exuberant body movements. After reaching the peak of excitement, the intensity of play begins to decrease. Calves may start to engage in less vigorous activities, such as slower running or gentle nudging, as they start to wind down from the high energy play. This stage (Phase IV) is characterized by a gradual reduction in the intensity of their actions and a shift towards more relaxed behaviors. When the play bout concludes (Phase V) calves often display behaviors indicative of relaxation. This may include lying down, social grooming, or simply resting in close proximity to their playmates. The Pleasure-Track below summarizes these hypothetical ethological observations for a group of calves. Average phase durations are also hypothetical, and in real scenarios are expected to vary with factors such as the species, age, space available, group size, climatic conditions, time of day, and hunger [20].",text,10
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"As with the Pain-Track, the Pleasure-Track is designed to capture situations in which there is uncertainty in the classification of the intensity of pleasure. Therefore, probabilities are used to represent how likely it is that each category of pleasure intensity is experienced. Uncertainty (or natural variation) regarding how long each phase of the experience lasts is captured in the range of values at the bottom row of each temporal segment. The Pleasure-Track illustrated above is hypothetical, but in real situations, each numerical input should be based on a thorough review of evidence from various sources. Because evidence will be often limited, criticism of the proposed values should be always encouraged.",text,11
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"Like with estimates of cumulative time in negative states (‘Cumulative Pain’), it is also possible to estimate ‘Cumulative Pleasure’, namely the time spent in positive affective states of different intensities, as follows:",text,12
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"The assessment of Cumulative Pleasure for an individual over a certain period or even their lifetime, can be also established by determining the cumulative impact of all the positive events experienced. Similar to negative experiences, this is best represented as the sum of the time spent in positive states from all these events, whether they happen sequentially or simultaneously. This also includes events that happen repeatedly. For instance, if young calves play as described in the hypothetical scenario 1-8 times a day for 4 weeks, the Cumulative Pleasure for each calf would be a total of approximately 15-130 minutes of Euphoria, 1 to 7.3 hours of Joy, and 1.7 to 13.3 hours of Satisfaction. This is the of the estimates shown in the Pleasure-Track, daily frequency of playing bout and total number of days playing.",text,13
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"Of course, different positive experiences can interact with each other in various ways, both physically and psychologically. These effects, when potentially leading to changes in the outcomes, must be investigated on a case-by-case basis.",text,14
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"Cumulative Pleasure can be also calculated at the population level. This requires accounting for differences in the exposure of population members to different positive experiences. This is achieved by weighting estimates by the prevalence of each experience, which enables  determining the cumulative time in pleasure experienced by an average member of the population. For example, in the hypothetical scenario of play in calves, Cumulative Pleasure could be weighted by the proportion of the calf population playing in the period of interest. For instance, if 50-90% of the calves played over the period of two weeks, Cumulative Pleasure for the average population member over this period would be the product of this prevalence and Cumulative Pleasure for each individual over the two weeks (resulting in 15-130 minutes of Euphoria, 59-440 minutes of Joy and 100-800 minutes of satisfaction)",text,15
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"As with estimates of time spent in pain, we don’t combine the four categories of pleasure intensity into a single one. This is because, as thoroughly discussed for pain [21], there are no empirical references to establish a weighting system between the intensity categories, hence a single scale of pleasure. ",text,16
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"By considering positive experiences, Welfare Footprints can be expressed as the time spent in negative and positive affective states of different intensities, i.e., Cumulative Pain and Cumulative Pleasure. To help visualize these effects, we propose to present Welfare Footprints as a double bar chart, as illustrated in the examples  below. This graphical representation juxtaposes the time spent in negative affective states against the time spent in positive affective states, across various intensities. The figure illustrates two footprints, depicting the distribution of time spent by an individual (or population, if the prevalence of different pains and pleasures are factored in the analysis) at each intensity of pain and pleasure (note that the quality of life depicted in the first Welfare Footprint [A] is clearly better than in the second [B]): ",text,17
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"The time units used in the chart for each intensity category (seconds, hours, days, and months) are flexible and can be adjusted. However, because of this flexibility, it is  crucial to always specify the units in the chart.",text,18
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"Because positive and negative intensities are displayed side by side, it is important to reiterate that no equivalence is implied. For instance, whether 10 seconds on the most intense form of pleasure (‘Bliss’) can be considered a direct counterpart of 10 seconds under the most intense form of pain (‘Excruciating’) remains to be determined.",text,19
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"The welfare of sentient organisms is shaped by a complex interplay of positive and negative affective states [6,19,22]. While combining both positive and negative experiences would offer a fuller picture of their affective lives, there are many challenges to measure or compare these states ethically or quantitatively  [5,23–27]. For example, Shriver [26] challenges the idea that pleasure and pain are just two ends of a continuum, pointing out that these states are driven by different cognitive processes, contribute differently to overall well-being, and have separate relationships with motivational systems. Considering these complexities, we do not attempt estimating how cumulative time in pain and pleasure might balance each other out. Instead, we focus on describing and measuring these affective states in a transparent and relatable way: by estimating time spent in states of pleasure and pain, at different levels of intensity.",text,20
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/03/12/positive-animal-welfare/,"We still maintain that negative states have a disproportionate impact on an individual’s life and welfare. Pain, especially when severe, can prevent the possibility of positive experiences. However, positive experiences and states are valuable, especially when more intense sources of pain have already been mitigated. Therefore, Welfare Footprints must not overlook this aspect. This text is aimed at incorporating positive experiences into the Welfare Footprint framework. Welfare Footprints that focus solely on pain are already valuable (especially for addressing the extreme situations many captive animals face), but a more comprehensive approach that includes positive experiences can provide a richer assessment. This complete version of a Welfare Footprint can thus better guide animal welfare policies, inform advocacy groups, and enhance public awareness about the ethical implications of animal use.",text,21

Second, once all secondary effects are considered, we suggest examining which weights would steer different decision paths, and determining how justifiable those weights are.

https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"Pain, both physical and psychological, is an integral aspect of life for sentient organisms. Pain serves a vital biological purpose by signaling actual or potential harm or injury, prompting individuals to avoid or mitigate the cause of pain [1]. It varies in intensity (where intensity denotes the unpleasantness or aversiveness experienced by an individual, not intensity of physical stimuli), from a mild annoyance to an excruciating agony, and duration, from fleeting moments to persistent, long-lasting conditions. This diversity in the intensity and duration of pain also serves the adaptive purpose of guiding priorities [1,2]: while an acute, sharp pain demands immediate attention, a chronic, dull ache reminds individuals of a lingering issue that, though not urgent, can also have multiple and serious consequences if not attended to.",text,8
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"While the function of pain as a biological alarm system is clear, its implications on overall well-being are more complex. Does a short-lived yet intense agony compromise well-being more than a prolonged but more moderate discomfort? For instance, farmed animals endure brief yet harrowing experiences, such as surgical castration without anesthesia or some slaughter practices, which are intensely painful but relatively quick. Contrast this with the more moderate, but continuous discomfort of being in an overcrowded space over several months. Both situations detrimentally affect welfare, but understanding which causes more distress, or if they can even be directly compared, is needed to make informed choices that prioritize welfare effectively [3].",text,9
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"In their quest to maximize fitness, organisms often operate on heuristic principles, prioritizing immediate or more intense threats based on simple rules of thumb, rather than a comprehensive evaluation of all potential consequences over a longer time frame [4]. This might mean, for instance, giving priority to pain of higher intensity, everything else being equal. However, in the realms of human and animal welfare, the goal is often to establish a metric that considers overall welfare over longer time frames, enabling the prioritization of actions that minimize suffering without burden shifting.",text,10
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"Within the Welfare Footprint framework [5], the intensity (unpleasantness) of negative affective experiences (referred to as ‘pain’ for simplicity) is categorized into four levels (Annoying, Hurtful, Disabling, and Excruciating) and welfare loss, or ‘suffering’, is expressed as total time spent in each intensity category (‘Cumulative Pain’). In this way, the method adopts a pragmatic stance by expressing outcomes across pain intensities over time without conflating them into a single metric. By doing so, it acknowledges the challenges and inherent uncertainties involved in comparing different pains across their dimensions, at the same time offering actionable, evidence-based results that can be used for the pursuit of different priorities (e.g., those prioritizing the relief of the worst kinds of preventable suffering can focus only on estimates of time in Disabling and Excruciating pain). Still, considering that this research area holds scientific and practical value, our focus here is to  contribute to discussion in this direction. ",text,11
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"We start by approaching the prioritization dilemma that may arise in the presence of  a trade-off between brief and intense suffering versus longer lasting suffering of a milder intensity. One way to investigate this question would be to explore, quantitatively, the aversiveness caused by different levels of pain intensity, and how these differences can be offset by varying durations. How long must an individual endure an annoying or hurtful discomfort for it to be equivalent to a few hours of disabling pain? Or more generally, how do intensity and duration relate? ? In other words, is it possible to convert categories of pain intensity from an ordinal to a ratio scale?",text,12
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"Experimentally ascertaining whether severity or duration has a greater impact on the welfare of animals presents many challenges [6,7]. Although many studies have assessed pain intensity in animals and non-verbal human subjects (typically through the use of observational pain scales that score behaviors such as muscle tension, posture, head position and facial expressions), these studies are silent with respect to the trade-off between the intensity and duration of pain. During a workshop organized by Rethink Priorities [8], experts convened to discuss potential experimental strategies for evaluating this question [7]. Several barriers were identified, including the difficulties in ensuring external validity given the impossibility of replicating the severity and duration of animal experiences, the hidden nature of affective states [9], the fact that animal behavior and preferences will not necessarily align with their long-term welfare interests, and the lack of sensitive and specific biological markers of cumulative affect [7]. ",text,13
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"Given the complexities of studying pain in non-human animals and the common evolutionary role of pain in sentient beings, an attractive approach is to pivot towards human studies. Humans share fundamental neurological and physiological systems with other animals, and have the capacity for self-reporting, which greatly simplifies data-collection. Despite the potential for bias in self-reporting [10], understanding how humans navigate this trade-off, or at least the degree to which the most intense pains are perceived as more aversive compared to lesser ones [7], may provide a valuable starting point. ",text,14
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"Therefore, we start by reviewing the extent to which empirical evidence in human studies could be potentially used in welfare prioritization when trade-offs between intensity and duration are present. ",text,15
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"In the domain of human research, various efforts exist to quantify the relationship between states of well-being. This is especially pronounced in global health, where understanding the impact of different health conditions, as determined by their severity and duration, is crucial for defining resource allocation policies. ",text,16
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"Accordingly, health metrics such as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) integrate in a single cardinal scale the time spent in a health state with the severity of the state, or its ‘disability weight’, which varies from 0 (perfect health) to 1 (death) [11]. Inferences of disability weights can be conducted in different ways, from paired comparisons of preferences for hypothetical health conditions, to assessment of the time one would trade from perfect health to avoid a particular health state [12]. In all cases, however, estimates are derived from multiple dimensions of health states (e.g., mobility, level of functioning, anxiety and depression, pain, and self-care), many of which are not necessarily associated with affective experiences, but rather with cultural and social perceptions of the states evaluated that are not relevant to animals. Also, participants in these studies often judge health states they have not personally experienced, relying instead on their perception of what the experience might feel like, leading to multiple potential biases [10].",text,17
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"One potentially promising strategy would thus involve conducting extensive surveys where participants from diverse backgrounds, who experienced the events evaluated, make comparisons between painful (affective) experiences of varying intensities and durations. This was the approach adopted by the Qualia Research Institute in a study that asked participants to quantitatively compare their most extreme negative experiences relative to each other [13,14] . Most participants rated their most intense painful experience as at least three times more intense than the second most intense [14]. The results resembled what one would expect if the subjective experience of pain were scaled in a logarithmic manner, with large differences between intensities. Still, biases that cause people to recollect experiences (especially extreme ones) very differently from how they were perceived at the time were not addressed. These effects can be so large that they may wash out the real effects of the nature of experience [10,15]. A famous example of such a bias is the Peak-End rule [16], namely the consistent observation that the peak of an experience and how it ends play important roles in determining how the experience is remembered. For example, if a painful procedure is prolonged by adding a period of less intense pain, it is retrospectively evaluated as less painful, even though it entailed more overall pain [17,18].",text,18
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"Given these constraints, in the next section we focus on studies that directly assess pain severity perceptions from participants currently experiencing or having recently undergone specific painful conditions. ",text,19
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"Upon reviewing the literature, we found that studies directly assessing pain severity perceptions from participants currently experiencing or having recently undergone specific painful conditions are surprisingly scarce. In an assessment of low back pain [19], patients were asked the number of years in each state they would exchange for resolution of their symptoms. All patients were willing to trade a disproportionately larger number of years to avoid a more severe pain state. Specifically, the perceived aversiveness of back pain increased non-linearly with severity (ratio severe to mild pain = 12:1). Another study used a similar methodology with chronic pain patients [20], estimating the disutility of mild, moderate and severe chronic pain as, respectively, 0.04, 0.14, and 0.26 in a paper test, and as 0.16, 0.26, and 0.27 when interviewed face to face. ",text,20
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"The observation that disproportionately longer durations are required to compensate for increases in pain intensity once more suggests that the aversiveness of pain increases super-linearly with intensity (i.e., high-intensity pain is disproportionately more unbearable than moderate pain). However, in all cases the aversiveness of the chronic conditions evaluated may have been to some extent confounded with simultaneously occurring disabilities and socio-cultural ramifications of pain, unlikely to be present in non-human species. We therefore searched for studies evaluating instances of acute pain. Two studies were found. One examined pain intensity experienced by women during labor or recently after delivery [21]. The authors report a preference for moderate pain (level 5 out of 10) for two hours over extreme pain (10/10) for 1 hour. Additionally, a prolonged but mild pain episode (18 hours at 1/10 intensity) was favored over an intense but shorter bout of pain (2 hours at 9/10). Although the methodology does not enable establishing the numerical equivalence among pain ratings, an intensity scored as level 10 was perceived as being more than twice as bad as one scored level 5, as was a score 9 perceived as worse than 9 times as bad as a score of 1. ",text,21
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"The second study investigated postoperative pain and cancer pain [22]. Here, the relationship among seven categories of pain (2: just noticeable, 3: weak, 4: mild, 5: moderate, 6: strong, 7: severe, 8: excruciating) was best described by a power function of the form y=0.99*x^2.99 for patients with postoperative pain and a power function of the form y=1.1*x^2.14 for patients with chronic cancer pain, where x corresponds to the pain category (1 to 8) and y the perception of intensity/distress. This translates into a perception of intensity for the seven categories of respectively 1, 8, 25, 62, 122, 210, 333 and 496 (postoperative pain) and 1, 5, 12, 21, 34, 51, 71 and 94 (cancer pain). ",text,22
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"We find that the latter studies are possibly the most informative on the potential temporal equivalence among pain intensity levels. In addition to being exclusively focused on pain, they were the only studies assessing painful conditions by patients experiencing the pain. We find it unlikely that the most intense pain experienced is of an Excruciating nature as defined in the Welfare Footprint framework, since this category is by definition associated with extreme and unbearable pain, not tolerated even if for a few seconds (a definition which does not coincide with the description of the patients in the studies above). But if the most intense pain, as evaluated in these studies, corresponded to the ‘Disabling’ category, the equivalence between Annoying and Disabling pain would be best represented by a ratio of  approximately 1 to 94-496. ",text,23
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"The observation that pain’s aversiveness escalates super-linearly with intensity coincides with findings from experiments in psychophysics, a discipline that investigates the relationship between the physical intensity of stimuli and their subjective perception [23]. Research in this area indicates that as sensations, including pain, increase in intensity, their perceived aversiveness grows exponentially [24]. For instance, as the intensity of an electric shock rises, perception of the pain grows at an accelerating rate, so the hardest shock can feel over 3,000 times worse than the mildest [25]. Likewise, in humans exposed to contact temperatures between 43°C and 51°C, the worst pain was judged to be 4,000 to 25,000 times more intense than the mildest pain [26] [27]. The non-linear nature of pain perception is further illustrated by Gómez-Emilsson [13] through examples such as the Scoville scale (a scale that measures the spicy heat of chili peppers in heat units) and the KIP scale to rate cluster headaches, both assumed to be logarithmic in nature.",text,24
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"These findings are also aligned with evolutionary reasoning. Intense pain demands immediate cognitive prioritization, putting other functions on hold to ensure that, in the presence of potentially fatal threats, an organism’s primary objective is the mitigation of the pain source. By making the experience of intense pain overwhelmingly aversive, organisms are compelled to take swift action, increasing the odds of survival. Additionally, the threat to an organism’s survival is likely to increase exponentially with the severity of the harm. For example, while minor injuries are typically manageable and heal, critical thresholds can be crossed with harms of greater severity, overwhelming the body’s compensatory capacities. Severe injuries can lead to blood loss, organ failure, or infections, each exponentially increasing the risk of mortality. Moreover, the energy required for recovery from severe injuries can rapidly deplete the body’s reserves, reducing the ability to withstand additional threats and creating a cycle of increased susceptibility to further harm. Inflammatory and immune responses can also become detrimental with more severe harms, as excessive inflammation can damage healthy tissues and lead to a feedback loop that accelerates the impoverishment of welfare. These responses are also consistent with the observation that higher pain intensities have a disproportionately larger impact on human functioning than lower pain intensities [28,29]. ",text,25
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"Nonetheless, defining this relationship’s precise nature, remains fraught with uncertainty. In addition to empirical evidence being surprisingly scarce, intensity weights are likely dynamic and modulated by multiple contextual factors. For example, whether pain is delivered in short bursts or continuously seems to play a pivotal role in determining its relative unpleasantness [30]. In general, the perceived aversiveness of pain will be modulated by a myriad of factors that include its type, anatomical distribution, attentional states, anticipation, past experience and fear [29,31–33].",text,26
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"Other layers of complexity are also present. For example, pain itself might distort an individual’s perception of time [34]. Does enduring a certain level of pain for a shorter duration feel longer than a lesser pain endured for the same period? Similarly, relative weightings between categories of pain could vary among species. The ratio of how much worse ‘Excruciating’ pain is compared to ‘Annoying’ pain may differ for an insect, a fish, a cow, or a human [35,36], particularly in the presence of species-specific differences in the subjective perception of time [34,37,38]. In fact, the very relationship between the aversiveness of pain and its intensity may itself change depending on the duration of the experience. With no data to understand how this happens, the extent to which extrapolating from short to long intervals is valid is unclear, speaking against the use of fixed equivalence levels among pain intensity levels. ",text,27
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"The non-linear nature of the relationship between pain intensity, as measured on orginal scales, and its corresponding aversiveness also means that even small errors in estimates of more intense pain have disproportionately larger effects in aggregated estimates of time suffering. To see this, consider the example in Table 1. Disabling pain is used as a reference, hence hypothetical equivalence factors represent the time needed in the other intensity categories that would make them as unpleasant as Disabling pain. As shown, there is a striking disparity in the contributions of different pain intensity categories to the final aggregated estimate. If Excruciating pain is assumed to be 10 to 1,000 more aversive than Disabling pain, estimates of time in Excruciating pain would account for over 90% of the aggregated estimate. Naturally, any imprecision in the estimated time in Excruciating pain would have a major impact on the aggregated results.",text,28
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,Table 1. Hypothetical weighting schemes: time units in each pain intensity category needed to make the experience as unpleasant as one time unit of disabling pain.,text,29
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"These observations could also lead to the conclusion that efforts on preventing cases of intense suffering should possibly dominate most utilitarian calculations [13]. However, while the nature of reactions to intense pain is shaped to be overwhelming and disproportionate, prolonged suffering of more moderate intensities is not necessarily less detrimental to overall welfare. In fact, enduring moderate pain over an extended period will typically affect an individual’s health and quality of life in a manner that exceeds what might be expected based on duration alone. For example, chronic pain can alter pain pathways and  make other pain experiences more intense, both by exacerbating the pain experience and reducing the threshold for future pain [39]. Likewise, chronic pain is associated with alterations in neurochemical and hormonal levels, reducing the ability to cope with stress and making individuals more vulnerable to disease [40]. Long-lasting pain can also lead to anxiety, depression, and helplessness, and prevent, partially or completely, positive affective experiences. Finally, experienced durations of moderate pain are often many orders of magnitude longer that those associated with intense pain.",text,30
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"In light of the complex interplay and cumulative impacts of chronic and acute experiences on overall well-being, comprehensive assessments of welfare that encompasses the effects derived from these experiences is essential for making informed decisions between interventions aimed at alleviating short-term intense suffering versus long-term moderate suffering. For example, in deciding between investing into banning experiences such as bodily mutilations or some slaughter methods versus longer-term issues such as high stocking density or confinement, an investigation of all the consequences of these practices would be required.",text,31
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"Effective resource allocation and prioritization among sources of suffering requires finding ways to quantify their burden in a comparative way. In the Welfare Footprint framework, the cumulative load of negative affective experiences endured by animals are quantified using a biologically meaningful metric: time spent in pain of four intensities. This granulated view of suffering is clear and intuitive and can be traced back to evidence, aiding resource allocation and decision-making processes targeting different priorities. Currently, disaggregated estimates can also rank most welfare challenges and farm animal production scenarios in terms of suffering",text,32
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"Yet, challenges arise when this (or other metrics) are asked to balance the intensity and duration of suffering. Foremost among these is the uncertainty associated with equivalence factors, which are needed for converting time spent in different intensity levels to a common metric. So far, these factors are not empirically substantiated, and carry high levels of uncertainty. ",text,33
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"Additionally, with aggregate estimates of time suffering, references to the actual experiences of animals are lost. While estimates of 10 minutes in Excruciating or Disabling pain are readily understandable by any audience, aggregate estimates of time in pain do not have an intuitive meaning. For example, it is not clear if a long time in Disabling-equivalent pain is dominated by experiences of chronic or acute suffering, or some combination thereof. Likewise, there is also an ethical puzzle regarding the validity of balancing different levels of suffering [41]. For example, aggregate estimates of time in pain in a population with individuals enduring intense pain could be similar to that of a population where no individual suffers intense pain, but a larger fraction of individuals experience milder pain for a sufficiently long time. The extent to which extreme suffering concentrated in fewer individuals can be compensated by milder suffering in a large number of individuals is unclear. ",text,34
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"In short, the seemingly straightforward concept of a weighting system between pain intensities is still riddled with limitations. Until equivalences in the dimensions of pain are better understood, we favor a disaggregated approach. In its current form the Welfare Footprint framework can rank most events, scenarios and systems. Where difficult trade-offs are present, the framework can be extended further by examining which weights would steer different decision-making paths, and then determine whether such a weight is scientifically justifiable. ",text,35
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"We illustrate this possibility by considering estimates of Cumulative Pain, at each intensity, for some of the most common welfare challenges commercial chickens experience over their lives, including slaughter (Table 2).",text,36
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"Table 2. Measures of Cumulative Pain in chickens (estimated seconds in pain, at each intensity). Estimates correspond to the midpoint of uncertainty intervals [42,43], and do not consider the welfare impacts of the secondary effects of the harms described. ‘Average flock member’: estimated time in pain weighted by the prevalence of the problem (considers that not all individuals experience the problem, and/or experience different degrees of severity). ‘Worst possible case’: individual enduring the worst possible outcome.",text,37
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,(1) pain that disrupts the ability of individuals to function optimally; (2) continuously distressing pain that takes priority over most behaviors (drastic reduction of activity and inattention to other stimuli); (3) extreme level of pain that would not normally be tolerated even if only for a few seconds.,text,38
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"The table shows that for an intervention that reduces extreme forms of suffering during slaughter (chiefly Excruciating pain) to be favored over one that averts less-intense suffering (including problems such as lameness in fast-growing broilers, chronic hunger in breeders or behavioral deprivation in caged hens), Excruciating pain would need to be perceived as being many orders of magnitude worse than Disabling or Hurtful pain. For instance, the average broiler stunned with electrical parameters set to reduce carcass damage (i.e., less effective at causing loss of consciousness, row ‘B’ in Table 2) endures about 70 seconds of Excruciating pain, while lameness causes, on average, 1,384,200 and 1,591,920 seconds of Hurtful and Disabling pain, respectively (‘D’). To justify prioritizing improvements in electrical stunning parameters over enhancements in lameness based solely on the reduction of suffering, the aversiveness of Excruciating pain would need to be perceived as approximately 3,000 times more severe than Disabling pain, or over 14,000 times more severe when considering the Disabling and Hurtful pain together. When comparing the most severe outcomes—birds that are scalded alive during slaughter (‘C’) against those suffering from the most severe form of lameness, with a gait score of 5 at the time of slaughter (‘E’)—the perceived aversiveness of Excruciating pain would need to be about 13,000 times greater than that of Disabling pain to justify a focus on stunning reforms over lameness improvements. Similarly, for interventions aimed at enhancing stunning parameters (‘B’) to be deemed more beneficial to welfare than those targeting the mitigation of chronic hunger in fast-growing female broiler breeders (‘F’), the aversiveness of Excruciating pain would need to be considered over 300,000 times worse than that of Disabling or Hurtful pain.",text,39
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"In determining the plausibility that Excruciating pain is several orders of magnitude more averse than pain intensities that are still very distressing (such as Disabling pain), it is also necessary to consider that estimates of the welfare impacts of the farm-level harms described, such as lameness, behavioral deprivation and chronic hunger, do not include their secondary effects. For example, in the case of chronic hunger, secondary effects emerging from feed restriction include aggression, higher incidence of feather pecking, skin lesions, foot pad lesions, disrupted resting, impaired immunity and long-term consequences for the welfare of offspring (meat chickens) through epigenetic effects [43]. In the case of lameness, by-products include a greater risk of infection, dehydration, contact dermatitis, the frustration to perform highly motivated behaviors and sleep disruption [43]. Should these effects be considered, they would require an even higher aversiveness ratio for Excruciating pain compared to Disabling and Hurtful pain. ",text,40
https://welfarefootprint.org/2024/02/20/shortagony-or-longache/,"While these observations align with the view that interventions targeting prolonged suffering may warrant prioritization absent evidence that the welfare impact of intense brief pains exceed more moderate pains by orders of magnitude [7], we suggest that in case of difficult trade-offs decisions should be determined on a case-by-case basis, considering species-specific pain responses, context of decision, and full range of welfare effects associated with the intervention. For instance, while the secondary effects of intense suffering at slaughter does not have lasting secondary effects due to the immediacy of death, intense brief suffering at early life (e.g., bodily mutilations) are likely to have multiple and profound welfare consequences, such as heightened pain sensitivity and reduced stress resilience. ",text,41

https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/07/25/a-novel-proposal-for-the-definition-of-pain/,"We argue that the IASP’s definition of pain fails to fully encompass its evolutionary, cognitive, and affective dimensions. It overlooks key aspects of this sensory phenomenon, such as its inherent consciousness, its independence from learning, and its evolutionary role extending beyond mere avoidance of tissue damage – when what should be considered is fitness damage. The definition is also overly human-centric. For example, the note that a person’s report of an experience as pain should be respected ignores the weak association between pain indicators and self-reports (Labus, Keefe and Jensen, 2003). Assuming greater validity of self-reports relative to objective indicators of pain is also detrimental to the advancement of pain assessment in non-verbal subjects.",text,1
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/07/25/a-novel-proposal-for-the-definition-of-pain/,"We further argue that the definition should acknowledge the multidimensional and dynamic (temporally varying) nature of pain, and allow for both physical and psychological categorizations. While there is often a reluctance to extend the term ‘pain’ beyond the realm of tissue damage or sensations processed by pain receptors, it is important to recognize that the experience of pain originates in the brain and can emerge independently of these receptors. The sensation of pain, likely evolved originally to process information from these receptors, has been co-opted evolutionarily to signal other threats to the organism beyond physical tissue damage.  Accordingly, evidence indicates the similar processing of emotional and physical pain in the brain (Kross et al., 2011), and the commonalities of their neural pathways (Sturgeon and Zautra, 2016), with psychological and physical pain engaging similar brain regions (Figure 1) and involving similar neurochemicals, such as opioids. Jaak Panksepp, the father of affective neuroscience, indeed used the term ‘psychological pain’ to describe emotional states associated with two primary systems, ‘PANIC/GRIEF’ and ‘FEAR’. This sub-classification of pain as “physical”  and “psychological” recognizes these evolutionary and neuroanatomical commonalities.",text,2

Still, some manifestations, such as neuropathic pain, can be maladaptive.

Below each stage, we have the indicators that can be detected at each stage. ‘Resource-based’ (upstream, within blue boxes) indicators and ‘animal-based’ indicators  (downstream, within orange-red boxes)  are essential for informing various metrics and frameworks used in animal welfare assessments.

https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"The possibility of genuinely experiencing multiple stimuli, thoughts or affective states simultaneously is a contentious topic. While one view holds that it is possible to multitask and attend to multiple stimuli in a parallel manner, another holds that what one may feel as attention to multiple stimuli in fact involves switching among them very rapidly, in a serial manner [1]. The latter view is consistent with theories that compare conscious awareness to a spotlight in a dark room, where the spotlight represents the focus of one’s awareness, and the dark room encompasses all sensory inputs, perceptions, memories, and affective states immediately available. Like a moving flashlight, it illuminates one experience at a time [2,3].",text,1
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"This scientific debate holds significance for assessments of animal welfare, as assumptions about how concurrent affective states (positive or negative) permit, exclude, or modulate one another can critically affect estimates of the actual times experienced in the affective states examined. This is especially true if we consider that organisms may frequently experience welfare challenges that overlap in time. Here we explore the role of attention on affective experiences within the context of ‘Cumulative Pain’ assessments [4] (where pain is used as a shorthand for any negative affective experiences). ",text,2
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"For instance, consider a hypothetical scenario where an individual is exposed, in one day, to two consecutive sources of Hurtful pain for five hours each. In this case, Cumulative time in pain would be represented by 10 hours. But if the two pain episodes unfolded simultaneously, would Cumulative Pain still be best represented by 10 hours? And during the five hours of simultaneous exposure to these two pain sources, would there be any time left for positive experiences? Would this change if the second source of pain was of a different intensity (e.g., Annoying)? ",text,3
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"So far, estimates of Cumulative Pain have been based on the operational assumption that multiple concurrent challenges have the above mentioned additive effect on experience (namely that their effects when experienced simultaneously are best represented by the sum of their isolated effects). This solution works well for the purpose of distinguishing the impact of welfare challenges across scenarios or production systems [5,6]. However, to the extent that attention is selective, switching among  simultaneously occurring experiences, estimates of cumulative time in pain can be refined to incorporate this phenomenon.  Such a refinement should enable estimating the time individuals are aware of and focused on each negative experience (as opposed to simply being exposed to them). Additionally, it allows exploring the time that remains available for individuals to enjoy positive affective experiences, once the time actually preoccupied with ‘pain’ is properly discounted. ",text,4
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,ATTENTION AS A LIMITED RESOURCE,text,5
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"The dynamic nature of attention plays a critical role in our affective experiences. Our affective states are not static, instead fluctuating as our attention shifts between various aspects of a situation, memory, or sensory input. This continuous shift in attention leads to the processing and prioritization of different emotions or emotional cues at different points in time.",text,6
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"The involuntary capture of attention by pain is a crucial aspect of its role as a warning signal of (real or perceived) danger. Pain demands attention, as it must change behavior to prevent survival and reproduction from being compromised [7–10]. In general, the greater the threat, the more intense the pain signal [11,12], engaging more of the individual’s attention [10,12–15].",text,7
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"Attention is, however, a limited resource, constrained by the brain’s architecture, its finite capacity for neural processing and limited supply of energy. Amidst the constant influx of vast amounts of sensory data, various mechanisms evolved to direct the brain’s attention to relevant information, while suppressing less relevant stimuli. For example, top-down mechanisms of attentional control are driven by an individual’s goals and expectations (e.g., if an individual is searching for red food, these mechanisms will enhance the processing of red stimuli while suppressing other colors) [16,17]. Allocation of attention is also determined by bottom-up saliency mechanisms that are triggered by the inherent features of stimuli, particularly their intensity, novelty, or contrast [18]. Sensory processing areas respond more robustly to more intense, contrasting and novel stimuli, and this enhanced activity increases the likelihood that these stimuli are attended to [19]. ",text,8
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"The perception of pain, both physical and psychological, is closely intertwined with these attentional processes. Pain’s ability to capture attention is also largely mediated by bottom-up saliency mechanisms triggered by the inherent features of the painful experience, such as their intensity or sudden onset. For example, in the case of physical pain, as intensity increases, nociceptors transmit more frequent and larger electrical signals along the pain-processing pathway, triggering the release of greater amounts of neurotransmitters like glutamate (a primary excitatory neurotransmitter) and neuromodulators like substance P (involved in pain transmission and sensitization of nociceptors). This, in turn, intensifies the activation of pain-processing neurons and amplifies pain signals within the neural network, capturing more attention to ensure that organisms respond adequately [20,21] . ",text,9
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"Pain is also modulated by voluntary mechanisms such as attentional focus [22]. Consciously directing attention towards a painful stimulus can increase the perception of pain intensity, given the heightened awareness of the pain sensation and the amplification of emotional components of pain, such as anxiety or distress [23,24]. Conversely (and this is also of great relevance to strategies to improve animal welfare), reduced pain is observed if attention is directed away from the painful stimuli by more salient experiences (e.g., fear, stress, highly motivated tasks) [21]. By occupying the brain’s limited attentional resources with alternative tasks or stimuli, the processing of pain signals is inhibited, leading to a reduction in pain perception. ",text,10
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"A natural conclusion from the previous section is that when individuals are exposed to simultaneous pain sources that differ in their salience, the brain will prioritize processing of the more salient one (i.e., more intense, novel or threatening), devoting a greater share of its limited attentional resources. ",text,11
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"Top-down mechanisms can also lead to inhibition of concurrent, less salient, pain. One such mechanism is known as conditioned pain modulation (CPM), or ‘diffuse noxious inhibitory control’ (a term used more often in animal research), sometimes described as ‘pain inhibits pain’  [25]. CPM occurs when response from a painful stimulus is inhibited by another, often spatially distant noxious stimulus. The process involves the activation of descending inhibitory pathways that can reduce the activity of pain-transmitting neurons in the spinal cord. One means whereby this modulation happens is through the release of endogenous opioids, which inhibit the release of neurotransmitters (e.g., substance P, glutamate) needed for pain transmission. Engagement in pleasant and highly motivated activities and movement may also trigger the release of endogenous opioids, as well as other neurochemicals like dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin, which can too contribute to a reduced perception of pain. Additionally, a strong painful experience may also serve as an anchor or comparison point by which others are judged (hence reducing their intensity relative to when they are judged individually) [26]",text,12
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"If less intense pain is nearly overshadowed by more intense pain, then the experience of simultaneous pain cannot be represented by the sum of the experience of each pain stimulus when experienced alone. High intensity pain will likely eliminate less intense pain during those moments when attention is recruited to the former. ",text,13
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"For the purposes of Cumulative Pain analysis, and until further knowledge is available, we therefore assume that when an individual experiences pain episodes of different intensities concurrently, only the most intense pain should be computed. ",text,14
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"With concurrent pain of similar intensity a more nuanced strategy is required. In line with observations that increasing the area of exposure to noxious stimuli produces a disproportionately small (sub-additive) increase in the perceived intensity of pain [27], we consider the possibility that for pain of similar intensity, the share of attention devoted to the experience is summated in a sub-additive way. The extent to which summation is sub-additive is, however, unclear. As a starting point for further investigation and debate, we consider two scenarios: ",text,15
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"Because pain of greater intensities demands a greater share of the organism’s attention, remaining attentional resources for the processing of additional pain would become progressively scarcer. A tentative set of estimates for the degree of attention allocated to each intensity category is as follows: (1) Excruciating: 91-100%, (2) Disabling: 61-90%, (3) Hurtful: 26-60%, (4) Annoying: 1-25%. In Table 1, these estimates are used to suggest the extent to which sub-additivity is expected with simultaneous sources of similarly intense pain in each case. ",text,16
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"For example, in the case of Excruciating pain, these thresholds would suggest that when a second source of Excruciating pain is experienced simultaneously, the maximum increase in the time attending to the new source of pain (in addition to that grabbed by an isolated source of Excruciating pain) would be 9%. Conversely, if two sources of Annoying pain are experienced simultaneously, there would be near complete additivity (70-99%). ",text,17
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"One obvious limitation of this approach is our current lack of evidence on the share of attention associated with each level of pain intensity (i.e. the validity of estimates in Table 1). Another limitation is the fact the proportion of attention allocated to each intensity category cannot be equated to its degree of unpleasantness. Consider this scenario as an example: two individuals are enjoying a pleasant conversation in a park. Suddenly, one is bitten by a mosquito. The discomfort experienced is just Annoying, capturing approximately 10% of the individual’s attention. Now imagine that a dozen additional mosquitoes begin to bite this person, causing their attention to become almost entirely focused on attempting to shoo the insects away and scratching the bites. The conversation in the park is no longer feasible. In this scenario, nearly all attention was focused on this experience. Although the unpleasantness of the experience increased, it is not possible to say that the intensity of the overall pain increased proportionally to the attention it demanded as the number of mosquitoes grew, becoming Hurtful. Pain intensity and pain-related attention are related but separate aspects of the pain experience. Pain intensity refers to the magnitude of the unpleasant sensory and emotional experience. Pain-related attention, on the other hand, refers to the extent to which an individual’s cognitive resources are directed towards or distracted by the pain. ",text,18
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"The second scenario adopts a simpler analytical approach, whereby each subsequent source of pain is assigned a progressively smaller increase in perceived intensity, with the second source contributing a 50% increase, the third source a 25% increase, and so on progressively. As before, in the Cumulative Pain framework such increases are translated into a greater share of time attending to pain of that intensity. ",text,19
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"Again, these proposed values are only provisional and should be considered as a simplified starting point given our limited understanding of pain and attention mechanisms, and the many potentially confounding factors in this analysis. For example, attention to pain will be also influenced by the presence of additional stimuli competing for attention, differences in the discriminatory properties of the pain sources, and variability in pain thresholds and coping mechanisms. Thus, the proposed values are unlikely to be universally applicable. ",text,20
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"The Cumulative Pain framework estimates the time individuals typically spend with pain of each intensity category. Thus, one hour of Hurtful pain means that an individual was exposed to a source of Hurtful pain for one hour. In its current form, the framework represents two simultaneous sources of Hurtful pain, each lasting an hour, as two hours of Hurtful pain. This choice offers the benefit of simplicity, and eliminates the need for more complex assumptions about the type of additivity in the subjective perception of pain, for which knowledge is not yet available. ",text,21
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"However, estimates computed in this manner often raise the question of how an individual can experience more hours of pain than there are hours in a day, or even a lifetime. For instance, consider a fictitious case: an animal spends her life with two ailments: (1) a mild “itch” (of an Annoying intensity) and (2) a mild thermal discomfort (of an Annoying nature too). She lives for 60 weeks, and pain is only felt when awake (16 hours/day, totaling 6,720 hours awake). In this case, she experiences 6,720 hours of Annoying pain due to the itch and 6,720 hours of Annoying pain due to thermal discomfort. The total of 13,440 hours of Annoying pain is longer than her life. This is a by-product of a technical choice in the approach, but one that may confuse the audience. ",text,22
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"One potential solution to this issue involves incorporating the degree of attention allocated to each pain intensity category into Cumulative Pain calculations. In other words, instead of estimating the duration an individual is subjected to pain (i.e., the entire period during which an individual is exposed to an unpleasant experience), one would estimate the time spent attending to pain, namely the duration of those moments an individual actively focuses on or is aware of this sensation. This latter time estimate will be typically shorter, as individuals may not be continuously aware of their discomfort or may actively choose to focus on other aspects of their experience part of the time.",text,23
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"For instance, if we assume that an individual is aware of Annoying pain only 25% of the time, then each hour of Annoying pain exposure should be converted into a maximum of 15 minutes of actual time spent in Annoying pain. Consequently, two simultaneous sources of annoying pain lasting one hour would be translated into a maximum of 30 minutes of annoying pain (following strategy A in the previous section) or 22.5 minutes of annoying pain (strategy B). ",text,24
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"By incorporating attention allocation into the framework, we can more accurately estimate the actual time spent aware of a negative affective state. This resolves the apparent contradiction of cumulative pain estimates exceeding a lifetime. However, the decision to incorporate this refinement depends on the reliability of estimates for the share of attention allocated to painful experiences of varying intensities. Adopting provisional values that may change in the future could harm the comparability of analytical results. Therefore, we greatly appreciate any feedback and input that can help inform our decision-making in this regard. ",text,25
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"Although, in our view, negative affective states (particularly more extreme forms) have a larger impact on well-being (e.g., improvements in positive states are frequently bounded and lost to hedonic adaptation, whereas adaptation to pain is unlikely; [28]), it is also important to consider how concurrent experiences of different valence may affect each other. In this regard, it is reasonable to assume that positive welfare is precluded, either partially or completely, in animals experiencing negative affective states, particularly the more intense ones. This assumption is in fact part of the defining criteria of the four intensity categories considered in the Cumulative Pain framework.",text,26
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"We propose that the amount of time individuals spend focusing on pain determines the time remaining for the experience of positive states. Thus, ‘potential for positive welfare’ can be defined as the estimated time available to enjoy positive affective experiences once the time spent in pain has been discounted. We purportedly use the term ‘potential’ since the absence of suffering both allows for a state of neutral welfare (something that by itself could be considered good) and for experiences of positive valence (e.g. enjoyment or pleasure), equated to good welfare by some authors [29]. ",text,27
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"Some practical limitations must be highlighted in this exercise. Again, as discussed, empirical evidence is still lacking on the extent to which pain of different intensities differentially demands attention. Importantly, estimating the potential for positive welfare requires considering all time in negative affective states. In other words, it is necessary to take into account every single challenge to which individuals are exposed. If only a subset of challenges is considered, the time available for neutral or positive welfare may be largely overestimated.",text,28
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"Additionally, the potential for positive welfare may be also overestimated if factors other than attention are not considered. For example, pain caused by traumatic injury or pathological processes may lead to immobility, restricted movement or impaired behavioral responsiveness to potentially pleasurable opportunities [30]. Similarly, sickness, weakness, nausea, dizziness and other debilitating affects may demotivate animals from engaging in physically active, gregarious and positive behaviors [30].",text,29
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"Finally, positive and negative affective states may interact in complex ways other than those considered. For instance, evidence indicates that in environments where animals can engage in motivated behaviors the perceived intensity of pain is reduced. In chickens, experiments conducted by Mike Gentle two decades ago [21,31] have shown that the higher the motivation to engage in a behavior (hence attention diverted to it), the higher the degree of endogenous analgesia mediated by opioids. The possibility to express positive behaviors may therefore inhibit pain that would otherwise be felt as Hurtful or Annoying (pain of higher intensity cannot, by definition, be eliminated with distraction).",text,30
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,Understanding the role of attention in the perception of concurrent negative affective states is crucial for refining estimates of cumulative time in pain and animal welfare assessments. Taking the temporal synchronicity of the various welfare challenges animals experience into account is also necessary to determine the potential for positive welfare — the time available for animals to experience positive affective states once the time spent in pain has been discounted.,text,31
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"As an immediate step to refine estimates of Cumulative Pain, we suggest that when individuals experience pain of different intensities simultaneously, the most intense pain is likely to capture most of the individual’s attention, overshadowing less intense pain. ",text,32
https://welfarefootprint.org/2023/04/16/attention-positivewelfare/,"When it comes to concurrent pain of similar intensity, the degree to which pain summation is sub-additive is an important aspect to consider. The analytical strategies presented here are meant only as a starting point for research and debate in this area. They depend critically on acquiring more knowledge about the share of attention demanded by pain of varying intensities. More evidence in this regard is also needed to determine, more rigorously, the actual time spent aware of and focused on pain, which in turn resolves the apparent contradiction of cumulative pain estimates surpassing a lifetime.",text,33

Ultimately, we would like to help transform the understanding of animal and human suffering, shifting it from an abstract concept to a scientifically measurable and extensively mapped phenomenon across all sentient beings.

More simply, anything that ‘feels bad’.

Many assessments also rely on indirect indicators of affective states, such as behavior and neurophysiology (outputs). Ultimately, any form of welfare assessment or attempt to improve animal welfare is inherently based on an assumed knowledge of what positively or negatively affects their inner experiences. The current framework is focused on inferring, using existing scientific evidence, parameters (time and intensity) natural to affective experiences. By atomizing the analysis into the effect of each welfare challenge on individuals, it  ensures that the evidence and assumptions supporting the proposed parameter values are made explicit, helping drive targeted progress.

Briefly, the method relies on the assessment of the duration and intensity of the pain caused by each of the welfare challenges to which a population of interest is exposed (in the period of interest), along with the assessment of the prevalence of the challenge in the population. This is done in the following way:Definition of scope of analysis:Definition of production system, population and time period of interest (e.g., lifetime, production phase)Identification of animals (life-fates) used in the system of interest (e.g., animals used as meat, as feed, breeders, fatalities) that ought to be included in the analysisIdentification of welfare challenges that life-fates of interest in the population studied may endure over period of interest that ought to be included in the analysis (analyses aimed at assessing the Welfare Footprint of a product are special cases where each and every life-fate in the production chain, and welfare challenge experienced, are considered)Assessment of the duration and intensity of each challenge over time. Hypotheses are described in Pain-Tracks.This step – the heart of the method – is the most critical and laborious and relies on multiple lines of evidence to justify the hypotheses proposed.Review of the prevalence of each welfare challenge in the population of interest;Calculation of Cumulative Time in Pain (of each intensity) experienced by affected individuals due to each challenge (CTP-victim)average population member due to each challenge (CTP-pop) by considering the prevalence of the challenge in the populationaverage population member due to all challenges combined (CTP-pop-all). For Welfare Footprints of animal-sourced products: calculation of CTP-pop-all per unit (weight, volume) of product.

https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"Subjectivity in the categorization of pain intensity is a problem that permeates all intensity scales, both numerical and nominal. The advantage of nominal scales lies in removing one layer of complexity in the attribution of intensity to the pain experience:  ‘mild’, with all its problems, is self-explanatory to most individuals, whereas ‘5’ must be explained and externally referenced. Use of discrete categories also avoids the problem of forcing numerical ratings that may not necessarily be linear into a linear scale, and prevents the ceiling effects that are frequently observed with numerical ratings of pain (where ratings close to the limits of the scale are constrained, increasing in intensity by smaller amounts than the intensity effectively experienced).",text,8
https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"We sought to reduce the ambiguity of widely used terminologies (mild, moderate, severe) by  using instead terms which, in addition to being semantically more specific, are qualified by specific references and criteria. Use of these criteria enables establishing more specific thresholds in the attribution of pain intensity that reduce the likelihood of misclassification, facilitating comparisons across conditions and individuals. For example, the pain of a fracture at the time of rupture matches the definition of a Disabling pain, not because this is the verbal description preferred by patients, but because it matches the definition of this intensity category: it captures nearly all the individual’s attention, sufferers are unable to perform other activities and strong analgesia is commonly required. Additionally, in this process the intensity and duration of the pain experience are completely disentangled (in some other approaches, the pain associated with a condition may be considered ‘severe’  because it lasts longer), further reducing variability in the classification process. ",text,9
https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"The number of categories was devised to represent an optimal balance between precision and clarity, with categories that are distinct enough to minimize the risk of misclassification.",text,10
https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"Although pain inherently concerns individuals, we operationally accept that the collective welfare of the members of a population can also be determined. Measuring cumulative pain at the population level is also necessary to account for the heterogeneity in the exposure of population members to different challenges. For example, while lameness is experienced by a large fraction of broiler chickens, fatal cases of ascites are only experienced by a few. Therefore, measurement efforts must consider the prevalence of each welfare challenge, so that pain is determined for the average member of the population (which may not necessarily correspond to any real organism). At the population level, the time spent at each level of pain intensity by the ‘average population member’ as a result of each challenge is determined by multiplying it by its prevalence. For example, if a condition causes 10 hours of Disabling pain and 70% of the population are affected, then the average member of this population could be said to experience 7 hours of Disabling pain due to the condition. Measurements at the population level enable comparing the impact of different practices and conditions across demographics, geographies, and time",text,11
https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"The method is receptive to all types of evidence. Any form of data or knowledge that has the potential to decrease the uncertainty associated with the potential intensity of a painful experience is considered as potentially valuable. Estimates of pain intensity are thus typically based on multiple lines of evidence, including neurophysiological indicators of pain, preference tests, pharmacological tests (e.g., effect of pain-killers), knowledge of existing pain-generating mechanisms in each case, observations of behavior and activity levels, and evolutionary reasoning. Pain is an attention-dominating state, a warning signal of threat (real or perceived) that must change behavior to protect the organism; the greater the threat, the more intense this signal should be. Accordingly, more unpleasant sensations should in general be more disruptive and engage more attention.  Four discrete categories of intensity are defined based on these criteria (Annoying, Hurtful, Disabling and Excruciating). For each welfare challenge analyzed, evidence of the pain it causes is compared against each category’s definition to inform the probability that the pain is of each intensity.",text,12
https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"The greater the strength and quality of the evidence that a given painful state matches the criteria defining one of the intensity categories, the greater the probability attributed to that category. Since the main adaptive value of pain is to prompt protective behavioral responses, behavioral indicators of pain are particularly valuable. Yet, the specific probability assigned to each category is still subjective. In recent developments of the framework, this subjectivity is constrained by the use of predefined and relatable probability categories. Specifically, for ‘each’ of the pain intensity levels, we ask: “Based on existing evidence, what is the likelihood that pain, for this welfare problem at this stage, is of the following intensity?”. Answers are limited to the following possibilities: CERTAIN (there is a 100% probability that pain is of this intensity), VERY LIKELY (there is a 90-99% probability that pain is of this intensity), LIKELY (there is a 60-89% probability that pain is of this intensity), POSSIBLE (there is a 40-59% probability that pain is of this intensity), UNLIKELY (there is a 10-39% probability that pain is of this intensity), VERY UNLIKELY (there is a 1-9% probability that pain is of this intensity), IMPOSSIBLE (there is 0% probability that pain is of this intensity). Naturally, (1) each choice must be as thoroughly justified as possible and (2) there are constraints on the answers. For example, it is not possible to estimate, for a given welfare problem at a point in time, that pain is both “certainly” Excruciating and “certainly” Disabling (the sum of probabilities across all four pain intensity levels cannot exceed 100%).",text,13
https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"In the unlikely event that no information was available, maximum uncertainty would be assumed, with the same probability (20%) attributed to each of the intensity categories (no pain, Annoying, Hurtful, Disabling, Excruciating). So far, however, we have not come across any scenarios in which information is completely unavailable.",text,14
https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"Validation (or falsification, in Karl Popper’s sense) of estimates of the intensity and duration of affective states using direct empirical evidence is not yet possible (constraints imposed on the validation of hypotheses empirically are also present in other scientific areas, such as astronomy). Because the assessment of affective states still relies on indirect evidence, the attribution of probabilities of pain intensity and duration to each temporal segment of a painful event is an (always open) exercise of presenting evidence, from as many relevant lines of enquiry and sources as possible, to justify the values proposed. Typically, hypotheses on parameter values are reviewed by other specialists in the field. But estimated parameter values are always treated as hypotheses, each associated with an uncertainty level (represented by subjective confidence intervals), which may be reduced (1) as more evidence becomes available and/or (2) greater consensus is reached towards proposed values by independent evaluators. In this way, proposed figures are continuously updated and strengthened.",text,15
https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"Estimates of intensity and duration associated with each welfare challenge are inputted in a notation tool, the Pain-Track, from which cumulative time in pain of each intensity are calculated. These estimates are based on existing scientific evidence (e.g., behavioral, neurophysiological, immunological indicators of welfare, knowledge of neurology, evolutionary reasoning). Thus, calculations of Cumulative Pain take full advantage of relevant existing evidence, while being limited only by its accuracy. In other words, estimates of Cumulative Pain are as accurate as the integration of existing practical and theoretical knowledge of animal welfare allows. ",text,16
https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"A single, aggregate metric of welfare loss would be more convenient for practical purposes. However, evidence to support inferences on the mathematical equivalence between the intensity categories is not yet available, so any integration exercise would still require relying only on subjective assessments of such an equivalence. Additionally, the validity of balancing different levels of suffering in comparisons involving different individuals or populations is not clear. For example, estimates of Cumulative Pain in a population with individuals enduring intense pain could be similar to that of a population where no individual suffers intense pain, but a larger fraction of individuals experience milder pain for a sufficiently long time. We believe that, so far, analyzing estimates of the total time spent in pain of each intensity represents a more accurate and transparent approach, grounded in explicit parameters with biological meaning. It also enables the pursuit of different priorities, such as relieving the worst kinds of preventable suffering (those associated with the Disabling and Excruciating categories of pain). Moreover, presentation of the disaggregated estimates enables their integration by audiences with different views on the weight that should be given to each level of pain intensity (e.g. here and here).",text,17
https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"A time-based equivalence between levels of pain intensity, based on scientific evidence, is not yet available. So far, the answer to this question is more of a personal, moral or philosophical nature. Because the focus of the Welfare Footprint Project is the production of scientific and evidence-based knowledge, we have opted for keeping the results of the analytical process untransformed, and leave the subjective weighing of pain intensity categories for individuals and institutions that will make use of them, and which may hold different views on what those weights should be. Still, it is possible to determine how much worse a given pain level would need to be for two situations to be considered equivalent in terms of suffering. For example, say that a typical bird kept in system ‘A’ experiences about 1,000 hours of Hurtful pain, whereas another living in a system ‘B’ experiences about 5 hours of Disabling pain. For the systems to be considered equivalent in terms of suffering, the Disabling intensity would need to be 200 times worse than the Hurtful intensity during all the time it is felt (1,000/5). If one finds this figure (200) too high, then system ‘A’ is judged to be worse than ‘B’. Otherwise, system ‘B’ is judged as better.",text,18
https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"So far, estimates of Cumulative Pain have been based on the operational assumption that multiple concurrent challenges have an additive effect on experience: namely that their effects when experienced simultaneously are best represented by the sum of their isolated effects. This solution works well for the purpose of distinguishing the impact of welfare challenges across scenarios or production systems.However, further refinements are being discussed to estimate (1) the time individuals spend in negative affective states when experiencing concurrent challenges of similar intensity, and (2) the time individuals spend in negative affective states when experiencing concurrent challenges of different intensity. In the latter case, when the pain from a challenge is so intense as to grab all or nearly all the individual’s attention (as is the case of Disabling or Excruciating pain), pain of lower intensity from other concurrent harms will be likely overridden, and should not be considered. A much more thorough discussion is available here. We would greatly appreciate any feedback that can help inform our decision-making in this regard.",text,19
https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"This phenomenon happens because individuals may experience more than one source of pain at the same time.The Cumulative Pain framework estimates the time individuals typically are exposed to pain of each intensity: one hour of Hurtful pain means that an individual was exposed to a source of Hurtful pain for one hour. In its current form, the framework thus represents two simultaneous sources of Hurtful pain, each lasting an hour, as two hours of Hurtful pain. This choice offers the benefit of simplicity, and eliminates the need for more complex assumptions about the type of additivity in the subjective perception of pain (for which knowledge is not yet available) when individuals experience welfare challenges that overlap in time . However, estimates computed in this manner often raise the question of how an individual can experience more hours of pain than there are hours in a day, or even a lifetime. For instance, consider a fictitious case: an animal spends her life with two ailments: (1) a mild “itch” (of an Annoying intensity) and (2) a mild thermal discomfort (of an Annoying nature too). She lives for 60 weeks, and pain is only felt when awake (16 hours/day, totaling 6,720 hours awake). In this case, she experiences 6,720 hours of Annoying pain due to the itch and 6,720 hours of Annoying pain due to thermal discomfort. The total of 13,440 hours of Annoying pain is longer than her life. This is a by-product of a technical choice in the approach. One potential solution to this issue involves incorporating the degree of attention allocated to each pain intensity category into Cumulative Pain calculations. In other words, instead of estimating the duration an individual is subjected to pain (i.e., the entire period during which an individual is exposed to an unpleasant experience), one would estimate the time spent attending to pain, namely the duration of those moments an individual actively focuses on or is aware of this sensation. A full discussion of the share of attention that may be dedicated to pain, in each intensity category, is available here. Time estimates calculated in this manner will be typically shorter, as individuals may not be continuously aware of their discomfort or may actively choose to focus on other aspects of their experience part of the time.For instance, if we assume that an individual is aware of Annoying pain only 25% of the time he is exposed to a discomfort of this intensity (in line with the definition of Annoying pain), then each hour of Annoying pain exposure should be converted to 15 minutes of actual time spent in Annoying pain. Consequently, two simultaneous sources of annoying pain lasting one hour would be translated into a maximum of 30 minutes of annoying pain. By incorporating attention allocation into the framework, we can more accurately estimate the actual time spent aware of a negative affective state. This also resolves the apparent contradiction of cumulative pain estimates exceeding a lifetime when individuals are exposed to more than one source of pain simultaneously. However, the decision to incorporate this refinement depends on the reliability of estimates for the share of attention allocated to painful experiences of varying intensities – for which evidence is not yet available. Adopting provisional values that may change in the future could harm the comparability of analytical results. We are therefore gathering more feedback on this issue before incorporating this refinement. Any input or contribution are thus greatly appreciated.",text,20
https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"Considering the importance, and greater urgency, of preventing animal suffering, the method has so far given priority to the quantification of negative affective states (an approach in line with suffering-focused ethical views). A focus on the reduction of suffering also stems from observations that negative experiences have a larger impact on well-being than positive ones (e.g., as improvements in positive states are frequently bounded, quickly reaching diminishing returns, as well as lost to hedonic adaptation, whereas adaptation to pain is unlikely). In the case of humans, this perspective forms the basis of policies guiding efforts at poverty alleviation and disease mitigation. It is also important to highlight that it is reasonable to assume that positive welfare is precluded, either partially or completely, in animals experiencing negative affective states, particularly the more intense ones (this assumption is in fact part of the defining criteria of the four intensity categories considered in the Cumulative Pain framework). In other words, understanding first the amount of time individuals spend focusing on pain is necessary if we are to understand the time remaining for the experience of positive states. A more thorough discussion of this topic is available here.Positive experiences can then be incorporated into analysis by expanding the framework to include estimates of the time spent in positive affective states. In the latter case, the same analytical steps would apply. For example, a “Pleasure-Track” could be used to describe hypotheses on the temporal evolution and intensity (e.g, in categories from Joy to Bliss) of positive states, which would be then used to estimate the Cumulative Time in Pleasure at the individual and population levels. Development of this refinement by other researchers and analysts would be most valuable. ",text,21
https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"At any time, the subjective well-being of individuals depends on an integration between positive and negative affective states, namely an yet undetermined subjective calculation of pleasure relative to suffering that may be positive or negative. Integration of positive and negative states over a longer time frame is also at the core of the notion of a “life worth living” or “good life”, or one where the surplus of pleasure over suffering is positive. Although such an integration exercise would be more truthful to the range of experiences an animal endures, it is still hindered by the challenges to establish a mathematical equivalence between positively and negatively valenced states. For example, the extent to which positive and negative experiences are morally symmetrical, or pleasure can compensate for time in pain, is far from consensual (see previous question). Even among humans, who can verbalize their preferences, whether time in pain of a certain intensity can be compensated for time of healthy and joyful life will often come down as a personal and moral choice. What a person (or group) may consider an acceptable trade-off, others might condemn. Additionally, compensation between positive and negative experiences is particularly difficult in cases of extreme suffering: would there be any magnitude of pleasure that would compensate for torture-like experiences? Another drawback of the integration of positive and negative effects are the implications for the analysis at the population level. If welfare is measured as a surplus of pleasure over suffering, would severe suffering endured by a few individuals be compensated by barely positive welfare endured by a sufficiently large number of individual",text,22
https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"The framework can be applied to any sentient species, including humans. Because the metric used is based on a phenomenon relevant to all sentient beings (time in pain of different intensities), it can be applied to virtually any sentient species to assess any context of relevance. ",text,23
https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"The Cumulative Pain metric can be used to estimate and compare the magnitude of suffering associated with different welfare challenges experienced by wild animals under different conditions and even by different species. In addition to enabling quantitative comparisons, an inventory of the magnitude of suffering associated with different challenges that wild animals typically endure can also promote awareness about wild animal suffering, help identify hotspots of suffering in the wild and, importantly, contribute to the design strategies to reduce suffering in the wild without burden shifting. An example of the application of the framework to wild animals is available here.",text,24
https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"Do three hours of Disabling pain in mammals represent the same suffering as three hours of Disabling pain in fish, or shrimp? The answer to this question is not simple. The extent to which different species differ in their capacity for affective experiences is one of the biggest questions of present and past times (the results of a major research effort to answer this question, the Moral Weight Project, is available here). Yet, it is one that must be addressed if Welfare Footprints are to be compared across species. The Welfare Footprint Project team will be soon joining efforts in this line of enquiry to investigate what might be at least workable solutions to this question.That said, this challenge does not preclude use of the same assessment methodology across species. Cumulative Pain estimates are based on universal parameters that should apply to any sentient organism: duration and intensity of affective experiences. Likewise, the criteria defining the categories of intensity are guided by measurable consequences of pain and general evolutionary principles that should also apply to most sentient creatures, such as how disruptive the experience is, how much attention it demands, whether it allows for positive states, how individuals trade-off pain for other experiences (positive or negative) and the extent to which it can be mitigated by pharmacological interventions (e.g., painkillers). For example, although the measurable manifestations of pain vary across species, the experience of Disabling pain for a pig should – in principle – be as attention-demanding and distressing as for a fish. Similarly, species may experience pain of similar intensity even if they differ in the ‘type’ of affective experience they endure as a result of idiosyncrasies in their anatomy, neurophysiology and cognition (e.g., grief is unlikely to be a universal emotion, but pain of intensities similar to those triggered by grief is likely experienced by multiple species due to other welfare challenges). Because the focus of the Cumulative Pain framework is on the intensity of pain, not type of pain, comparisons become easier.",text,25
https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"This transformation can be applied to Cumulative Pain estimates by anyone who wishes to do so. Still, we focus on absolute  time in pain since: (1) conversion of absolute time in pain to a proportion of lifetime in pain is predominantly driven by a desire to compare lifetime spent in unpleasant states with lifetime spent in neutral or positive states. Yet, the extent to which the latter can compensate for the former, or the validity of such compensation at the population level, is far from consensual (see question “how would positive experiences compensate for negative ones?”); (2) the extent to which 10 hours of Disabling pain in a lifetime of 100 hours (10%) is the same as 1,000 hours of Disabling pain in a lifetime of 10,000 hours (10%) is not clear to us; (3)  in practical terms, such a conversion exercise would only apply to analyses where the effect of each and every adverse event over the entire lifetime of individuals is considered, to ensure that the time assumed to be in neutral/positive states is completely devoid of negative experiences (the type of analysis not yet conducted by the WFP team); and (4) when multiple harms are experienced simultaneously, estimates of time in pain can be longer than the lifespan of individuals.",text,26
https://welfarefootprint.org/frequently-asked-questions/,"
The main limitation is one that pervades all welfare assessments methods: the lack of direct markers of affective states, particularly intensity of affective states, hence the need to rely on indirect evidence. The approach is structured to reduce the effects of this challenge by segmenting the experience of pain, by promoting the use of all relevant scientific evidence to reduce uncertainty around estimates and by forcing all assumptions to be explicit and open to scrutiny and updating.
Another limitation is its working load. Estimates of each parameter value (duration, intensity and prevalence of each welfare challenge) are derived from a laborious review of the literature and broad array of evidence sources, and require a critical understanding of the availability and weaknesses of existing evidence, along with a broad knowledge of the subject at hand. 
A paradoxical limitation for dissemination purposes is the analytical simplicity of the framework: unfortunately, part of the academic community still associates unnecessary complexity with analytical sophistication.

Simultaneously, the industrial processes behind animal food production have become increasingly complex and diverse. Nowadays, the description of processes and procedures typically associated with different animal production systems presents challenges of technical nature to specialists and educators, and of understanding to laypersons. Production systems can vary widely depending on legislation, enforcement, consumer demand, market requirements, and regional tradition. Differences may be present in terms of the breeds used, stocking densities, the type and size of enclosures, the provision of enrichment, the timing and length of the production phases, veterinary interventions, and other factors. Even farms using similar housing systems possess differences in their physical structure and management strategies, which will lead to differences in productivity, environmental impact, and animal welfare outcomes.",text,2

Different from other senses for which objective external references are available (eg, sound, color, smell), pain is an intimate experience that cannot be calibrated against external yardsticks. That is, pain is as intimate and subjective a phenomenon as it can be, which can only be inferred in other subjects by indirect means that are highly prone to error and noise (verbal self-reports, behavioral patterns, facial expressions, non-specific physiological changes, and fuzzy neuronal activity patterns). The complexity of pain is further increased by modulatory factors that affect both its intensity and perception, such as the diversity of internal and external triggers, pain’s dependence on context and prior experience, and cognitive and physiological differences in the processing and evaluation of stimuli.",text,2

https://welfarefootprint.org/technical-definitions/,"[Living Conditions Framework]: A hierarchical framework designed to organize and map information about the welfare conditions of sentient organisms into five distinct levels: 

[Species]: The sentient species under examination or care.  

[System] and [Production System]: The conditions in which the population of interest lives, encompassing everything from farming systems (e.g., intensive, semi-intensive, extensive), environments like zoos and sanctuaries, laboratory settings, natural habitats (wild animals) to socio-economic environments (in the case of humans). 

[Life-Fate]: The roles or destinies of individuals within a species, characterized by the commonalities in critical life events and hazards they face (Alonso and Schuck-Paim 2017).  For example, in a pig production system, different life-fates could include: (1) breeding females (sows): female pigs kept for reproductive purposes, (2) Market pigs: raised primarily for meat, (3) male breeders: male pigs kept for breeding purposes.

[Life-Phases]: The major life stages of a Life-Fate of interest, each presenting unique challenges and welfare implications. For example, in the case female breeding pigs, the following phases are present: (1) Suckling, (2) Postweaning, (3) Growth, (4) Pre-puberty, (5) Breeding Cycle: repetitive cycle involving conception, gestation, and farrowing, (6) Transportation, (7) Slaughter.

[Circumstance]: refers to specific environmental and management conditions that animals encounter during each phase of their lives (also referred to as ‘factors’). Covers both ‘external circumstances’—attributes of the environment like housing, climate, feeding practices, management—and ‘internal circumstances’ which include biological traits such as genetics, personality, and health. These circumstances collectively influence the backdrop against which an individual’s life unfolds.",text,11
https://welfarefootprint.org/technical-definitions/,"CONDITIONS
[Conditions]: the immediate consequences resulting from an organism’s interaction with Circumstances, serving as precursors to affective states. 

Negative:
[Negative Physical Conditions]: Detrimental physical effects on an organism that arise from adverse living conditions or internal imbalances, leading to negative affective states.

[Negative Psychological Conditions]: Perceived risks or potential for harm that can provoke negative psychological responses, such as fear, stress, or anxiety.

Positive: 
[Positive Physical Conditions]: Favorable physical effects on an organism resulting from conducive living conditions or internal well-being, contributing to positive affective states.

[Positive Psychological Conditions]: Positive psychological opportunities or experiences provided by an organism’s environment or internal state, leading to feelings of satisfaction, contentment, or joy.",text,12
https://welfarefootprint.org/technical-definitions/,[Affective State]: The emotional states resulting from specific primary biological consequences. Affective experiences can be positive or negative,text,13
https://welfarefootprint.org/technical-definitions/,"NEGATIVE AFFECTIVE STATES: GENERAL CONCEPTS
Pain (Operational Definition): Broadly defined as any felt negative affective state. This includes both [physical pain], namely states with a somatic origin (e.g. aches, hunger, injuries, thermal stress) that are often the consequence of [Negative Physical Conditions], and [psychological pain], states related to the primary emotional systems (e.g. fear, frustration, boredom) that are often the consequence of [Negative Psychological Conditions].

Pain (Proposal for a New Definition): Pain is a conscious experience, evolved to elicit corrective behavior in response to actual or imminent damage to an organism’s survival and/or reproduction. It is affectively and cognitively processed as an adverse and dynamic sensation that can vary in intensity, duration, texture, spatial specificity, and anatomical location. Pain is characterized as ‘physical’ when primarily triggered by pain receptors and as ‘psychological’ when triggered by memory and primary emotional systems. Still, some manifestations, such as neuropathic pain, can be maladaptive. Depending on its intensity and duration, pain can override other adaptive instincts and motivational drives and lead to severe suffering.

Cumulative Pain: total burden of pain (measured in time spent in negative affective states of different intensities) that an organism (or population) experiences over a specific period or as a consequence of exposure to a ‘Hazard’.

Pain-Track: A notation method for describing negative affective experiences based on their temporal evolution. It considers both the intensity and duration of pain for each phase of a pain episode, allowing for the integration of available scientific evidence",text,14
https://welfarefootprint.org/technical-definitions/,"Pain Intensity: Intensity, when referred to in relation to pain, denotes the subjective measure of unpleasantness or aversiveness experienced by an individual. This measure is not directly tied to the physical stimuli’s magnitude but rather to the personal, subjective experience of the pain’s severity or distress.",text,15
https://welfarefootprint.org/technical-definitions/,"Annoying. Experiences of pain perceived as aversive, but not intense enough to disrupt routine in a way that alters adaptive functioning or affects the behaviors that individuals are motivated to perform. Similarly, Annoying pain should not deter individuals from enjoying pleasant experiences with no short-term function (e.g., play) and positive social interactions. Sufferers can ignore this sensation most of the time. Performance of cognitive tasks demanding attention are either not affected or only mildly affected. Physiological departures from expected baseline values are not expected to be present. Vocalizations and other overt expressions of pain should not be observed.",text,16
https://welfarefootprint.org/technical-definitions/,"Hurtful. Experiences of pain in this category disrupt the ability of individuals to function optimally. Different from Annoying pain, the ability to draw attention away from the sensation of pain is reduced: awareness of pain is likely to be present most of the time, interspersed by brief periods during which pain can be ignored depending on the level of distraction provided by other activities. Individuals can still conduct routine activities that are important in the short-term (e.g. eating, foraging) and perform cognitively demanding tasks, but an impairment in their ability or motivation to do so is likely to be observed. Although individuals may still engage in behaviors they are strongly motivated to perform (i.e., exploratory, comfort, maintenance), their frequency or duration is likely to be reduced. Engagement in positive activities with no immediate benefits is not expected. Reduced alertness and inattention to ongoing stimuli may be present. The effect of (effective) drugs (e.g., analgesics if the pain is physical, psychotropic drugs in the case of psychological pain) in the alleviation of symptoms is expected.",text,17
https://welfarefootprint.org/technical-definitions/,"Disabling. Pain at this level takes priority over most bids for behavioral execution and prevents most forms of enjoyment or positive welfare. Pain is continuously distressing. Individuals affected by harms in this category often change their activity levels drastically (the degree of disruption in the ability of an organism to function optimally should not be confused with the overt expression of pain behaviors, which is less likely in prey species). Inattention and unresponsiveness to milder forms of pain or other ongoing stimuli and surroundings is likely to be observed. Relief often requires higher drug dosages or more powerful drugs. The term Disabling refers to the disability caused by ‘pain’, not to any structural disability.",text,18
https://welfarefootprint.org/technical-definitions/,"Excruciating. All conditions and events associated with extreme levels of pain that are not normally tolerated even if only for a few seconds. In humans, it would mark the threshold of pain under which many people choose to take their lives rather than endure the pain. This is the case, for example, of scalding and severe burning events. Behavioral patterns associated with experiences in this category may include loud screaming, involuntary shaking, extreme muscle tension, or extreme restlessness. Another criterion is the manifestation of behaviors that individuals would strongly refrain from displaying under normal circumstances, as they threaten body integrity (e.g. running into hazardous areas or exposing oneself to sources of danger, such as predators, as a result of pain or of attempts to alleviate it). The attribution of conditions to this level must therefore be done cautiously. Concealment of pain is not possible.",text,19
https://welfarefootprint.org/technical-definitions/,"POSITIVE AFFECTIVE STATES: GENERAL CONCEPTS
Pleasure (Operational Definition): broadly defined as any felt positive affective state. This encompasses both [physical pleasure],which is often the consequence of [Positive Physical Conditions], and [psychological pleasure], often the consequence of [Positive Psychological Conditions].

Pleasure (Proposal for a New Definition): Pleasure is a conscious experience, evolved to elicit or reinforce behaviors beneficial to an organism’s survival and/or reproduction. It is affectively and cognitively processed as a positive and dynamic sensation that can vary in intensity, duration, texture, spatial specificity, and anatomical location. Pleasure is characterized as ‘physical’ when primarily triggered by stimuli that are directly rewarding or enjoyable, and as ‘psychological’ when triggered by cognitive processes, memories, and emotional states. Depending on its intensity and duration, pleasure can override other adaptive instincts and motivational drives, leading to states of dependency and self-damage.

Cumulative Pleasure: total amoung of pleasure (measured in time spent in positive affective state of different intensities) that an organism (or population) experiences over a specific period or as a direct consequence of exposure to a ‘Resource’.

Pleasure-Track: a notation method for describing the positive affective experiences based on their temporal evolution. It considers both the intensity and duration of pleasure for each phase of a pleasure episode, allowing for the integration of available scientific evidence.",text,20
https://welfarefootprint.org/technical-definitions/,"POSITIVE: PLEASURE INTENSITY DEFINITIONS
Satisfaction. Low-intensity positive states, where an individual shows subtle signs of comfort or satisfaction associated with a physical sensation or meeting a non-essential need. These might include comfortable bedding conditions, grooming or basking in the sun. Engagement is present but not overwhelming, allowing the individual to easily shift attention to other stimuli or activities as needed. 

Joy. Positive states involving greater engagement in rewarding activities. Individuals may display enhanced vigor in play, stronger social bonding, or more or active engagement in highly preferred activities, such as foraging. Behaviors indicative of joy suggest a greater focus on these positive experiences, although they do not exclusively dominate the individual’s attention. The individual’s behavior is noticeably directed towards maintaining or enhancing the positive experience. Physiological indicators may include heightened autonomic responses (e.g., heart rate).

Euphoria. Experiences in this category are intense and the primary focus of attention. Everything else might seem secondary. Euphoria might be observed in immersive play, mating rituals, or the pursuit and enjoyment of highly favored resources, such as a successful hunt. In some situations, this intense state might lead to spontaneous expressions of pleasure, such as vocalizations.

Bliss. At the peak of positive experiences, bliss represents a profound level of pleasure that pervades the individual’s sensory and emotional experience. It’s a sensation that transcends the ordinary. When experiencing bliss, the sensation of pleasure is so overwhelming that it eclipses other immediate needs or environmental stimuli for the duration of the experience. The world outside fades away as the individual is consumed by this all-encompassing state. Examples could be orgasmic states, reuniting with socially significant partners that are long missing, or the encounter of extremely positive conditions after prolonged periods of stress and hardship. Blissful states are expected to be rare and of short duration.",text,21
https://welfarefootprint.org/technical-definitions/,"POPULATION VARIABLES
Average Population Member. Although pain inherently concerns individuals, we operationally accept that the collective welfare of the members of a population can also be determined. Measurement at the population level is also necessary to account for the heterogeneity in the exposure of population members to different hazards. For example, while lameness is experienced by a large fraction of broiler chickens, fatal cases of ascites are only experienced by a few. Therefore, measurement efforts must consider the prevalence of each affective harm, so that pain is determined for the average member of the population (which may not necessarily correspond to any real organism). In the Cumulative Pain framework, the time spent at each level of pain intensity by the ‘average population member’ as a result of each harm is determined by multiplying it by its prevalence. For example, if a harm causes 10 hours of Disabling pain and 70% of the target population are affected, then the average member of this population could be said to experience 7 hours of Disabling pain due to this harm. Measurements at the population level enable comparing the impact of different practices and conditions across demographics, geographies, and time.

Target Population: A  population considered in a risk assessment, where a population is a group of animals defined by a set of common characteristics (EFSA, 2012).",text,22

[Freedom Evaluation Questions]: specific questions designed to evaluate aspects of the conditions in which organisms live that impact its welfare. These questions are structured around the Five Freedoms [6]  framework and address various circumstances, such as environmental conditions, social needs, and health care.

[Specific Freedom]: One component of the Five Freedoms framework for animal welfare  [6], which includes freedom from hunger and thirst; discomfort; pain, injury, or disease; to express normal behavior; and from fear and distress. Each freedom addresses one fundamental aspect of animal well-being.

[Life Interval of Interest, in days]: The number of days under consideration for a specific analysis. This can either encompass the entire lifespan of an organism or a designated period of interest, such as a specific life-phase. This interval is set based on the study’s scope or the data’s availability. 

[Total Hours in Pain in Life Interval of Interest]: The cumulative number of hours an organism spends in pain during the ‘Focused Life Interval’. This is calculated by multiplying the days during which a condition persists within the focused interval by the number of hours of pain experienced on each of those days.

[Days that the Condition Lasts in Life Interval of Interest]: The total number of days within the ‘Focused Life Interval’ during which the organism experiences a specific condition that causes pain.

[Hours in Pain within Days with the Condition]: The average number of hours per day an organism experiences pain when the condition is active. This measure accounts for the variability in the duration of pain across different days.

[Proportion of Life Interval of Interest in Pain]: The fraction of the ‘Focused Life Interval’ during which the organism is in pain, expressed as a percentage. This is calculated by dividing the ‘Total Hours in Pain in Focused Life Interval’ by the total hours in the entire ‘Focused Life Interval’ (which is the product of the number of days in the interval and 24 hours per day).",text,23

https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/analytical-approach/,"The measurement of animal welfare is notoriously complex and inherently constrained by the difficulty of assessing the subjective experiences of nonverbal subjects. Yet, to effectively improve animals’  lives, we must clearly understand the relative impact of different living conditions and risk factors on welfare. But how can we compare aversive conditions of a different nature? For example, what is more unpleasant for a pig or chicken: the acute pain from a fracture or prolonged hunger? What about conditions that do not involve tissue damage or unmet physiological needs, such as behavioral deprivations?",text,2
https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/analytical-approach/,"To answer these questions, we developed a framework to describe and quantify negative affective states (operationally defined simply as ‘pain’) in animals. It focuses on the two most relevant dimensions of negative affective experiences: intensity and duration. The metric enables estimating the time individuals spend in negative affective states of a physical or psychological nature of different intensities as the result of one or more harms (e.g., diseases, injuries, deprivations). A new notation protocol (the Pain-Track) is used in which the duration of the experience is represented along the horizontal axis and intensity is represented by four categories in the vertical axis. Pain experiences are partitioned into temporal segments, where hypotheses for the experienced duration and intensity are proposed based on existing welfare indicators (e.g., neurophysiological, behavioral, anatomical, evolutionary). The analytical framework can be similarly applied to quantify positive affective experiences.",text,3

High levels of aerial pollutants often found in closed facilities, such as ammonia, further compromise respiratory function and increase the likelihood of infection by respiratory pathogens.

Additionally, the approach can provide insights into potential biological adaptations evolved in response to subsets of hazards individuals are exposed to, enable the description of the diversity and distribution of suffering within species in a systematic manner, and inform the public about a widespread, yet neglected, aspect of life in the wild (suffering) based on the notion of individual life experiences and stories – concepts easier to empathize with than mortality and morbidity figures.

We can be confident that a number of farm animal welfare reforms (such as banning battery cages and promoting the use of slower-growing broiler strains) will positively affect the lives of billions of animals raised in industrial farming systems.

We consider a simple approach: the quantification of how much suffering is associated with different causes of death, all of which are experienced by most wild animal species.

To illustrate it, consider first the estimates of presented on the Table below, on the cumulative time in pain of different intensities endured as a result of different causes of death: lack of water leading to death by dehydration, unresolved infections leading to sepsis, fatal attacks from conspecifics, and blood loss from having major arteries and veins cut  or punctured.",text,10

https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/cumulative-pain-and-wild-animal-welfare-assessments/,"Although these estimates of Cumulative Pain were established for a farmed species (laying hens and broiler birds), these causes are commonly associated with death in most wild animals. For example, in case of severe infections (a common occurrence in wild animals), death by septic shock is a frequent outcome. Likewise, blood loss (exsanguination) is typically the underlying cause of death in the case of predation and some injuries. Dehydration is also a frequent cause of death in cases of drought, dislodgement and disabilities that prevent water intake. And although triggered by a different mechanism (food shortages), intra-specific conflicts resulting in cannibalism are also observed in wild species. Even though estimates of Cumulative Pain experienced from these types of death are likely to vary across species due to differences in their metabolism, life-history traits and environment, general patterns are likely to be very similar (many of the pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical symptoms triggered by these challenges are shared across a wide range of vertebrates). ",text,12
https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/cumulative-pain-and-wild-animal-welfare-assessments/,"With that in mind, estimates in the table above suggest that events leading to death by blood loss (e.g., predation, some injuries) are likely associated with the least amount of suffering (an observation possibly counter-intuitive to the general public, as images associated with a violent death are typically more impacting). Yet, a slow death due to a generalized infection, for example, imposes a much higher burden of pain on individuals. ",text,13
https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/cumulative-pain-and-wild-animal-welfare-assessments/,"Similar patterns are expected in the case of non-fatal diseases, injuries and deprivations.

Likewise, malnutrition and starvation are expected to underlie a large fraction of the burden of pain endured by animals living in the wild.  In general, long-lasting ailments (e.g.  some forms of parasitism, locomotion-impairing conditions) are bound to be associated with a greater burden of pain.",text,14

The species has one of the longest lifespans in captivity (about two years). Also, as a species farmed relatively recently (only a few generations from its wild ancestors), Atlantic salmon experience very high disease and mortality rates. This is also demonstrated by the high volume of antibiotics used as prophylactics by some producers (particularly developing countries) in the industry – possibly the most industrialized intensive aquaculture system today. Additionally, Atlantic salmon are carnivorous, so for every farmed fish the loss of welfare incurred includes that of a large number of individuals used to make fishmeal and fish oil ( Atlantic salmon consume the largest share of fishmeal and fish oil in aquaculture). Likewise, salmon farms often use large numbers of cleaner fish to treat sea lice infections, with several issues compromising their welfare.",text,6

The increasing global appetite for fish and the sharp decline in wild fish populations each year will keep forcing farmed fish numbers up: global production of fish has quadrupled over the past 50 years, with no clear signs of growth stagnation yet.",text,2
https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/welfare-of-farmed-fish/,"Farmed fish are typically smaller than terrestrial farm animals, and grow at a much slower rate.

https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/welfare-of-farmed-fish/,"METHODS
Selection of 25 top farmed fish species, based on global production data (FAO), for which information on potential for good welfare (as determined by the species FishEthoScore) was available;
Parameters assessed for each species: (1) time in captivity per Kg of boneless meat produced (includes time in captivity of individuals that died before slaughter) and (2) number of fish slaughtered per Kg of boneless meat produced;
Compounding factors analysed: (1) estimated slaughter age, (2) weight at slaughter (market size), (3) life span as fingerlings (young fish developed to the point where they have scales and working fins) and in grow-out facilities, (4) mortality as fingerlings and in grow-out facilities;
Estimates of mortality and lifespan are based on a brief and limited review of the scarce literature on each species, and may not reflect typical industry values; they reflect our 90% subjective confidence intervals (an excellent explanation of subjective confidence intervals is given by Animal Charity Evaluators, here). The sources for each estimate are available in the interactive charts (tabs Lifespan and Mortality);
Estimates of market weight are mostly derived from FishCount, FAO and ACE;
Calculations are available at this Guesstimate model;
Estimates of the number of fish killed exclude: mortality of brood stock, destruction of fish due to deformities, mortality of larvae and fry (fish developed to the point where they are capable of feeding themselves), mortality during shipping, mortality of fish used as feed, bycatch, mortality of cleaner fish and indirect mortality of wild animals (e.g. from diseases and drug residues released in the water).
Welfare scores, developed by the FishEthoGroup – Fair-Fish International, represent the assessment of each species potential for good welfare in captivity based, predominantly, on the extent to which conditions in captivity matches their natural environmental. Ten criteria are evaluated (aggregation, home range, depth range, migration, reproduction, substrate, stress, aggression, malformations and slaughter). Each criteria may receive either a rating (HIGH, MEDIUM or LOW potential for good welfare) or no rating (‘no findings’, ‘unclear’). We only considered species for which at least 5 criteria had a rating. Scores are measured as the sum of criteria scoring HIGH divided by the total number of criteria for which a rating was available.
Conversion from live to edible weight considers conversion factors for fillets (conversion varies widely for fresh, headed, gutted, frozen, filleted, and combinations)",text,6
https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/welfare-of-farmed-fish/,"MAIN FINDINGS
Among the species investigated, an average of 4 to 10 individuals of the ‘farmed species’ are killed for every Kg of boneless meat; this is ∼8 to 13 times greater than the number of chickens killed for a Kg of boneless chicken meat (0.5-0.75);
On average 3,000 (1,200 to 4,800) days in captivity (sum of days in captivity for all individuals killed), or about 8 years, are required to produce 1 Kg of boneless fish meat. This is ∼120 times longer than the time in captivity needed to produce 1 Kg of boneless chicken meat (∼25 days). Notice, though, that a longer time in captivity does not necessarily translate into greater suffering, as we have shown with broiler chickens (e.g., cumulative time in pain is greater in shorter-lived fast growing broilers than in longer-lived slower-growing breeds). Cumulative pain in farmed fish has yet to be measured.
Time in captivity per Kg of edible meat varies widely, more within fish species than between fish and some land animals. For example, Cobia spends 53-120 days in what seems to be very poor welfare (potential for good welfare score: 1.1) for every Kg of boneless meat produced, but producing the same weight from the European perch and yellow catfish (which can potentially enjoy somewhat better welfare: scores of 2.5 and 6, respectively) requires 5,100-42,000 and 5,000-19,000 captive days, respectively.
The potential for good welfare in captivity under high-standard farming conditions is very poor (average score: 1.8 out of 10), as measured by the ten criteria in the FishEthoScore. This score, however, is predominantly based on how well farming conditions match the species’ natural environment. On the one hand, individuals may be able to adapt to some artificial conditions without loss of welfare. On the other, the actual effects of the challenges farmed fish endure (e.g., diseases, injuries, poor water quality, starvation, fear, behavioral deprivations) on welfare (i.e. the intensity of the experience’s unpleasantness, its duration) are not considered in this score, nor is their prevalence. Therefore, use of the Cumulative Pain metric should provide more accurate estimates in  follow-up assessments.",text,7

Cumulative mortality varies on average from 11 to 82% from the fingerling until the end of the grow-out stages (market size). This figure is only the tip of the iceberg: it excludes deaths during shipping, culling, brood stock and larvae mortality. It may also exclude removal of moribund fish (which may end up in harvest statistics). It also excludes deaths of fish used as cleaners or as feed, their associated bycatch, and deaths of wild fish from residues and diseases from fish farms.

https://welfarefootprint.org/welfare-assessments/,"MILESTONE 2 - MAPPING PRODUCTION PROCESSES AND HARMS
Animal production systems encompass various production stages and practices where opportunities to either cause or prevent harm to animal welfare arise. Gaining a deep understanding of these systems and their typical variability is crucial to create a comprehensive map of potential affective harms and estimate their likely prevalence, duration and severity.

Protocol to Mapping Animal Production Processes and Potential Affective Harms

We recommend using process flowcharts to dissect animal production systems. By highlighting distinct paths, it facilitates a deeper understanding of these processes and their varying impacts on animal welfare .

Protocol to identify Affective Harms emerging from  changes in external and internal factors 

Different life phases pose distinct challenges. We suggest using diagrams to map these conditions and their interactions for a specific life phase, hel[ing identify and assess their welfare impacts.

https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/poultry-slaughter/,"On any day, over 200 million chickens are slaughtered for food, a figure that excludes unproductive laying hens killed in the egg production chain and the mass-killing of male chicks deemed unsuitable for meat production. It amounts to over 8 million chickens killed per hour, representing more than 95% of all land animals slaughtered for food on this planet.",text,2
https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/poultry-slaughter/,"With millions of animals slaughtered daily, even small differences in the magnitude of the pain associated with the different manners of death that befall these birds become crucial to inform strategies to reduce suffering in the poultry industry. In this project, we address the welfare impacts of different slaughter methods used for poultry. ",text,3
https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/poultry-slaughter/,"Although originally developed as a means of immobilising the animal for ease of processing, recognition that the pain endured during slaughter should be alleviated has become the main driver for the implementation of slaughter methods that include an initial stunning stage to render the animal unconscious and insensible to pain 一 ideally in an immediate and painless way 一 until the time of death. For instance, since 1974 European legislation requires that all animals to be killed for human consumption must be stunned before they are slaughtered. Similarly, most countries in Latin America have some legislation in place that makes it compulsory to use methods to stun animals prior to their slaughter for consumption. ",text,4
https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/poultry-slaughter/,"Unfortunately, pre-slaughter stunning regulation is still lacking in many parts of the world and, where present, enforcement is poor and legal loopholes abound. For example, European legislation on welfare at the time of killing states that animals “must be spared any avoidable pain, distress or suffering during their killing”. Yet, the choice of the term ‘avoidable’ in several paragraphs of the regulation leaves room for interpretation and flexibility in the implementation. In the United States, poultry are not listed under the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act, hence there is no legal requirement for pre-slaughter stunning 一 its practice is merely voluntary. The observed frailties in the legislation in Europe and the US are an indicator of welfare during slaughter in other regions.",text,5

Experiences of pain perceived as aversive, but not intense enough to disrupt the animal’s routine in a way that alters adaptive functioning or affects the behaviors that animals are motivated to perform. Similarly, Annoying pain should not deter individuals from enjoying pleasant experiences with no short-term function (e.g., play) and positive social interactions. Sufferers can ignore this sensation most of the time. Performance of cognitive tasks demanding attention are either not affected or only mildly affected. Physiological departures from expected baseline values are not expected to be present. Vocalizations and other overt expressions of pain should not be observed.",text,10

Experiences of pain in this category disrupt the ability of individuals to function optimally. Different from Annoying pain, the ability to draw attention away from the sensation of pain is reduced: awareness of pain is likely to be present most of the time, interspersed by brief periods during which pain can be ignored depending on the level of distraction provided by other activities. Individuals can still conduct routine activities that are important in the short-term (e.g. eating, foraging) and perform cognitively demanding tasks, but an impairment in their ability or motivation to do so is likely to be observed. Although animals may still engage in behaviors they are strongly motivated to perform (i.e., exploratory, comfort, sexual, and maintenance behaviors), their frequency or duration is likely to be reduced. Engagement in positive activities with no immediate benefits (e.g., play in piglets, dustbathing in chickens) is not expected. Reduced alertness and inattention to ongoing stimuli may be present. The effect of (effective) drugs (e.g., analgesics if pain is physical, psychotropic drugs in the case of psychological pain) in the alleviation of symptoms is expected. ",text,11

Pain at this level takes priority over most bids for behavioral execution and prevents all forms of enjoyment or positive welfare. Pain is continuously distressing. Individuals affected by harms in this category often change their activity levels drastically (the degree of disruption in the ability of an organism to function optimally should not be confused with the overt expression of pain behaviors, which is less likely in prey species). Inattention and unresponsiveness to milder forms of pain or other ongoing stimuli and surroundings is likely to be observed. Relief often requires higher drug dosages or more powerful drugs.

All conditions and events associated with extreme levels of pain that are not normally tolerated even if only for a few seconds.

Behavioral patterns associated with experiences in this category may include loud screaming, involuntary shaking, extreme muscle tension, or extreme restlessness. Another criterion is the manifestation of behaviors that individuals would strongly refrain from displaying under normal circumstances, as they threaten body integrity (e.g. running into hazardous areas or exposing oneself to sources of danger, such as predators, as a result of pain or of attempts to alleviate it). The attribution of conditions to this level must therefore be done cautiously. Concealment of pain is not possible.",text,13
https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/poultry-slaughter/,"AVERAGE BROILER
Although pain inherently concerns individuals, we operationally accept that the collective welfare of the members of a population can also be determined. Measuring cumulative pain at the population level is also necessary to account for the heterogeneity in the exposure of population members to different challenges. For example, while lameness is experienced by a large fraction of broiler chickens,  fatal cases of ascites are only experienced by a few. Therefore, measurement efforts must consider the prevalence of each welfare challenge, so that pain is determined for the average member of the population (which may not necessarily correspond to any real organism). At the population level, the time spent at each level of pain intensity as a result of each challenge is determined by multiplying it by its prevalence. For example, if a condition causes 10 hours of Disabling pain and 70% of the population are affected, then the average member of this population could be said to experience 7 hours of Disabling pain due to the condition. Measurements at the population level enable comparing the impact of different practices and conditions across demographics, geographies, and time.",text,14
https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/poultry-slaughter/,"From the moment of placement in the stunning/slaughter system until loss of consciousness, the average broiler is expected to spend 0.02 (0.01-0.03) seconds in Excruciating pain and 8.82 (5.4-12.2) seconds in Disabling pain in properly managed multi-stage CO2 systems, compared to 
(i) 2.18 (0.9-3.5) seconds in Excruciating pain and 69 (23-115) seconds in Disabling pain in electrical waterbath systems where birds are fatally electrocuted (stun-kill systems typically used in the EU);
(ii) 6.4 (0.5-12.3) seconds in Excruciating pain and 93 (25-161) seconds in Disabling pain in electrical systems set to reduce carcass damage (low voltage-high frequency, typically used in the U.S. and countries lacking stunning regulation); and
(iii) 1.19 (0.6-1.8) seconds in Excruciating pain and 70 (24-115) seconds in Disabling pain in electrical systems that ensure the highest possible (96%) effectiveness of stunning by electronarcosis. ",text,15
https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/poultry-slaughter/,"Most of the time in Excruciating pain derives from the experience of live scalding (expected to affect very different proportions of birds in each system) and, to a lesser extent, from electro-immobilization and fatal electrocution in electrical waterbath systems. Disabling pain is associated (though not continuously or exclusively) with the pain from the compression of injured legs during shackling, wing fractures, pre-stun shocks, electro-immobilization, fatal electrocution and the incision of vessels and carotids. In CO2 stunning, Disabling pain emerges from the possibility that the sensation of breathlessness and aversiveness to CO2 reach a Disabling level at certain CO2 concentrations.",text,16
https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/poultry-slaughter/,"A transition from electrical waterbath systems to properly implemented multi-stage CO2 systems is expected to substantially reduce the time the average broiler spends in acutely intense pain. Overall, 99% to nearly 100% of the time in Excruciating pain during stunning could be prevented, along with 87-90% of the time in Disabling pain. 
Such a transition would also spare 7.5 to 550 million birds in the United States and up to 44 million birds in the European Union from the experience of live scalding every year. ",text,17
https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/poultry-slaughter/,"In CAS systems where crates are not opened prior to stunning (for the identification/removal of birds dead on arrival at the slaughterhouse or placement of birds into stunning units), the possibility of animal abuse is virtually eliminated.
However, there is a trade-off between a reduction of intense pain with the use of CO2 stunning systems and an increase in the duration of (milder) pain given the aversive nature of CO2 prior to loss of consciousness. In general, a 27-36% longer time in Hurtful and Annoying pain is expected in multi-stage CO2 systems compared to electrical waterbath systems. ",text,18
https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/poultry-slaughter/,"The expected welfare benefits of CO2 stunning systems are lost if exposure times or gas concentrations are insufficient to ensure that birds do not regain consciousness after leaving the gas stunner. Slaughter plants may not be willing to leave birds in the stunner for a long time given their prioritization of speed and high throughput rates. Short exposure time is likely to result in a large fraction of birds regaining consciousness, who could thus experience the pain associated with neck cutting, bleeding and scalding. In such cases, the estimated time in intense pain will be longer [3.2 (0.03-6.37) seconds in Excruciating pain and 14.5 (5.65–23.3) sec in Disabling pain] than that typically associated with ‘properly set and managed’ electrical waterbath systems.

Market forces support the transition, as once implemented CO2 stunning is associated with reduced carcass damage. Still, other gas stunning systems not investigated here (e.g. inert gases) are thought to be less aversive to poultry than carbon dioxide, yet a transition to CO2 stunning makes future investment into other systems less likely.",text,20
https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/poultry-slaughter/,"Preventing or alleviating the most extreme forms of pain and suffering, including the acutely intense and concentrated states of pain endured at slaughter plants, is an ethical priority, often viewed as being of greater urgency than alleviating less severe states of suffering. The potential for interventions 一 other than stunning reforms 一 to prevent extreme forms of acute suffering depends on the extent with which one concurs that conditions other than those experienced in the slaughter plant also cause Excruciating pain in their victims. Among these conditions are fatal cases of ascites, associated with acute breathlessness and visceral pain produced by the accumulation of fluid and pressure in the abdomen in the moments preceding death, as well as cases of extreme pain from severe sepsis, which are accompanied by major organ failure, hemorrhages on the heart, liver, kidneys, muscles and serous membranes (in humans, severe sepsis is often equated to severe burning, e.g. ‘my sepsis felt like my body was on fire, burning from the inside out‘). To the extent that these instances of extreme pain at the farm can be compared with those endured by some individuals at slaughter (particularly the experience of scalding), other interventions could have a greater potential of alleviating extreme suffering (e.g. the transition from fast- to a slower-growing breed reaching a slaughter weight of 2.5 Kg at 56 days is expected to prevent 33 [13 to 53] hours of Disabling pain, 79 [-99 to 260] hours of Hurtful and 25 [5 to 45] seconds of Excruciating pain for every bird affected by this intervention).

https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/poultry-slaughter/,"Whether the neural circuitry for fear in birds is activated by exposure to hypercapnic gases has not yet been investigated. Since in mammals fear is triggered through the detection of carbon dioxide and acidosis by the amygdala, an extremely ancient structure also present in birds, a similar mechanism is most likely to be present in chickens. 
Research has shown that fear and panic in mammals are suppressed with the administration of antianxiety drugs. Yet the effect of such drugs, or those known to relieve breathlessness in humans such as inhaled furosemide, on chickens’ responses to CO2 have not been explored. ",text,29

Ineffective stunning with CAS is likely to occur if gas concentrations are not properly adjusted or exposure time is insufficient, in which case a large fraction of birds may regain consciousness and experience the pain from neck cutting and scalding.

https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers/,IMPACT OF THE BETTER CHICKEN COMMITMENT AND THE ADOPTION OF SLOWER-GROWING BREEDS ON THE WELFARE OF BROILER CHICKENS,text,1
https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers/,"Commercial broiler production represents some of the most serious animal welfare issues in the livestock industry. Over the last years, campaigns to improve the way broiler chickens are produced, including the use of slower-growing broiler strains, have been gathering pace in many countries. Currently, one of the leading standards for broiler welfare driving the food industry towards higher welfare practices is the Better Chicken Commitment (BCC), a set of recommendations that address housing, stocking density, growth rate and stunning methods.

In this project, we used the Cumulative Pain Framework to investigate how the adoption of the BCC and similar welfare certification programs affect the welfare of broilers. Specifically, we examine concerns that the use of slower-growing breeds may increase suffering by extending the life of chickens for the production of the same amount of meat. ",text,2
https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers/,"The framework translates evidence on the duration and intensity of the pain associated with these challenges into time spent in four categories of pain intensity: Annoying, Hurtful, Disabling, and Excruciating. Pain is operationally defined as ‘any negative affective state’, thus encompassing negative affective experiences of both somatic origin (physical pain) and more related to the primary emotional systems (psychological pain). By considering the prevalence of each welfare challenge in the population, estimated times in pain are also determined for the average population member (in this case, the average commercial broiler). The method is transparent, brings important knowledge gaps into light, and incorporates uncertainty about all parameters into the final estimates.
",text,3
https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers/,"We analyzed the following scenarios, for which data on broiler welfare was available. First, a conventional scenario represented by the use of fast-growing breeds (e.g., Aviagen Ross 308, 708, Cobb 500). Although the performance objectives of these breeds can reach as much as 70 g/day, with birds weighing 2.5 Kg in 35 days, average slaughter weight of broilers in the EU and the US is, respectively, 2.5 Kg and 2.9 Kg, reached at 42 and 47 days. This corresponds to an average daily gain (ADG) of 60 and 62 g/day, respectively. We used these values as a benchmark for typical growth rates in fast-growing strains, assuming an ADG of 61 g/day, corresponding to a slaughter weight of 2.5 Kg at 42 days. For the reformed scenario, represented by the use of a slower-growing strain, we assumed an average ADG of 45-46 g/day, hence that the same slaughter weight would be reached in approximately 56 days. This is a growth rate consistent with typical figures achieved by various of the breeds approved under the BCC (e.g. JA 987, 787, Ranger Gold), also referred to as medium- or intermediate-growing broilers. This growth rate also falls within the acceptability of other welfare certification schemes, such as the ‘Beter Leven’ program in the Netherlands and the ‘Deutsche Tierschutzbund’ in Germany, which determine a growth rate of up to 45 g/day, and a minimum lifespan of 56 days. Importantly, data on the incidence of important welfare challenges in slower-growing breeds (e.g. proportion of birds with different degrees of lameness) is available predominantly for birds growing at approximately this rate.",text,4
https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers/,"In both scenarios, we focused on key welfare challenges affecting broilers: gait-impairing conditions (lameness), cardiovascular problems, thermal stress, the frustration potentially arising from the deprivation of various motivated behaviors, chronic hunger in broiler breeders and the welfare harms endured during stunning and slaughter. This is, however, not an exhaustive list of every welfare harm affecting broilers, hence Cumulative Times in Pain underestimate the typical times in pain endured by broilers in commercial production. Because the welfare harms not considered (e.g. infectious diseases, inflammatory conditions, contact dermatitis, muscle abnormalities, additional negative effects of feed deprivation in conventional breeders other than chronic hunger) have a higher incidence in fast-growing birds, the estimates presented are conservative, representing the minimum time in pain expected to be averted with implementation of the BCC and similar standards.

These figures correspond to a reduction of approximately 66%, 24% and 78% , respectively, in the time experienced in Disabling, Hurtful and Excruciating pain relative to a conventional scenario due to lameness, cardiopulmonary disorders, behavioral deprivation and thermal stress. ",text,12
https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers/,"The estimates are conservative, representing the minimum time in pain expected to be averted with implementation of the BCC and slower-growing birds. Among other things, they do not consider other welfare challenges with a higher incidence in fast-growing birds, such as the higher prevalence infectious diseases, inflammatory conditions, muscle abnormalities and contact dermatitis (hock burns, breast blisters, footpad dermatitis). Additionally, fast-growing birds have greater exposure to environmental stressors such as poorer air quality, litter quality and disrupted resting. Also, we have not considered the secondary effects of hunger in fast-growing female breeders (e.g., thirst, aggression, frustration), nor the effects of feed restriction on male breeders (see Table 1 of Chapter 7 for an expanded list of harms excluded from analysis that would increase Cumulative Pain for fast-growing breeds). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the actual benefits of the BCC surpass the estimates.",text,13
https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers/,"In general, the slower the growth rate, the shorter the cumulative time in pain experience over a lifetime, despite differences in lifespan. Should breeds with growth rates slower than those assumed in the reformed scenario be used, the time in pain averted with the reform would be longer, despite a longer lifespan. By the same logic, slower-growing breeds growing faster (e.g. 50g/day) should endure a longer time in pain, despite their shorter lifespan. In all cases, reforms promoting a transition to slower-growing breeds should expect a reduction of the cumulative time in pain (net positive change) for all breeds considered under the BCC scheme: the slower the growth rate, the higher the expected welfare impact.",text,14
https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers/,"Lameness is the most serious welfare concern for the average broiler chicken. 
The negative impact of heat stress on the welfare of the average broiler is substantially larger than the impact of cardiopulmonary challenges (ascites and sudden death syndrome) given their relatively low prevalence. 
Fatal cases of ascites (one of the main causes of mortality in broilers) are associated with extreme suffering (nearly 40 minutes in Excruciating pain) in affected birds.",text,15
https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers/,"Chronic hunger from feed restriction in broiler breeders is the greatest source of physical pain that any individual chicken will endure over her life. Female breeders from fast-growing strains are estimated to experience at least 2,000 hours of Disabling pain and 4,170 hours in Hurtful pain as a result of hunger. Additional welfare challenges (not considered) emerging from feed restriction include aggression, higher incidence of feather pecking, skin lesions, foot pad lesions, disrupted resting, impaired immunity and long-term consequences for the welfare of offspring (meat chickens) through epigenetic effects. Therefore, although still associated with a net positive impact, the benefits achieved with implementation of the BCC and slower-growing strains can only be fully realized if both males and females from parent lines are also slower-growing. Commitments based on the use of crosses (e.g. Cobb-Sasso) would be, consequently, still associated with severe suffering in parent birds.",text,16
https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers/,"Although the adoption of better management practices – including lower stocking density, longer resting times and the provision of enrichment – is beneficial and desirable for improving broiler welfare, their impact is limited if the negative welfare effects inherently associated with the genetics for fast growth are not addressed.
Any implementation of the BCC and similar commitments should ensure that the use of higher welfare breeds happens concomitantly with the monitoring of their growth rate under ad libitum feeding conditions. Importantly, the incidence of different welfare outcomes should be closely monitored. The importance of ‘demonstrating compliance with the standards via third-party auditing cannot be overstated.
The BCC also contemplates the use of alternative stunning methods. In a separate report, we show that a transition from electrical waterbath systems to properly implemented multi-stage CO2 systems is expected to substantially reduce the time the average broiler spends in acutely intense pain.",text,17

All parameter values used for the analysis (estimates of duration, intensity, number of occurrences, and the prevalence of each welfare offense) are justified in the book “Quantifying Pain in Broilers” (see above).

https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers/,"Although time is at the heart of how conscious organisms experience life, the temporal dimension of the welfare outcomes experienced by non-human animals has been greatly overlooked in the animal welfare sciences. Little attention has been paid to understanding when diseases emerge, how long disease states last, or how quickly they progress. Longitudinal studies following individuals over time are very much needed. 
Very few studies have examined the progression of lameness in broilers over time. Longitudinal data are needed to establish patterns of disease onset and progression for birds with different gait scores at the end of production. This knowledge is critical to establish more accurately the time that broilers affected by lameness spend in pain.",text,21
https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers/,"Similarly, data is very scarce on the onset and progression of lameness in slower-growing breeds of broilers. Knowledge is not yet available on the extent to which the onset of lameness changes for birds with different growth rates.
Little information is available on the extent to which leg culling is implemented in the industry, or how long severely lame birds spend in this condition before being culled or dying.",text,22
https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers/,"Surveys on the prevalence of lameness in regions other than Europe, particularly in top chicken-producing countries (e.g., US, China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Argentina), are very much needed. Studies should strive to describe disaggregated data on the prevalence of birds within different gait scores, as opposed to calculated scores only.
No published data is available on the prevalence of birds in each gait score for slower-growing breeds raised in commercial conditions. The only data available, disaggregated by gait score, is from experimental trials. Surveys of flocks kept in commercial conditions are critically needed.",text,23
https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers/,"The extent to which the onset of cardiorespiratory abnormalities is delayed in slower-growing birds is currently unknown.
There is no recent data on the prevalence of mortality from ascites in commercial flocks, neither for fast- nor slower-growing strains. Existing data is from experimental studies, or from small and old datasets. Surveys in the slaughter plant are available, but they depict an incomplete picture of the problem as they disregard on-farm and transport mortality. Likewise, recent information on the incidence of non-fatal cases of pulmonary hypertension in commercial flocks is currently lacking.",text,24
https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers/,"The underlying causes of reduced feed intake in birds experiencing pulmonary hypertension are not fully understood. Lack of knowledge on whether it is due to a lack of appetite driven by metabolic changes or to feelings of discomfort makes it difficult to estimate the extent of suffering experienced by affected individuals.
Little is known about the strength of broilers’ motivation to forage, perch and dustbathe. Operant and preference testing would allow for a better understanding of the welfare impact of deprivation of these behavioral opportunities.",text,25
https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers/,"Data on the overnight behavior of broilers is limited, hence knowledge of the welfare impacts of the inability to roost and the effects of rest disruption. 
Longitudinal data on the proportion of birds affected by heat stress over the entire production cycle, as well as typical variations along the day and year, are much needed, particularly outside Europe.
To our knowledge, there has been no research evaluating the degree of aversion that heat stress represents to broiler chickens. ",text,26
https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers/,"Further research on the extent to which chronic hunger is aversive in broiler breeders would be beneficial (e.g. demand elasticity or ‘willingness to pay’ tests).

https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers/,"The extent to which published research on farm animal welfare is biased towards conditions of better welfare is unknown. Currently, most research data is from northern European countries (where welfare legislation is stricter) and in many cases from facilities that volunteer or agree to participate in research studies (hence which may have better welfare standards). Studies in commercial operations outside Europe and policies aimed at facilitating access of researchers to commercial farms could be highly useful to provide a clearer picture of the conditions typically experienced by broiler chickens, their breeders and other farm animals.",text,28
