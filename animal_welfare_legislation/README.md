# Animal Welfare Legislation Dataset (AWLD)

## Overview

This dataset is derived from the [**ANIMAL WELFARE LEGISLATION DATABASE (AWLD)**](https://www.globalanimallaw.org/database/index.html), created and maintained by the **Global Animal Law (GAL) Association**. The dataset breaks down various pieces of animal welfare legislation from around the world into manageable text chunks, which are suitable for use in machine learning (ML) models, including text embedding models. The data covers multiple regions and legislation types, providing detailed information and links to the original legal texts.

The source database, which was based on publicly available information as of March 31st, 2021, was initially curated by **Sabine Brels, PhD in Law**, who led the GAL UNCAHP Project from 2014 to February 2021. 

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is structured into six key columns, each providing specific and relevant information about the legislation.

### Columns

  Example: `http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A31998L0058`

- **Text Chunk Position**:  
  The position of the text chunk within the original document. This is useful for maintaining the order of the chunks when analyzing the full legislation.  
  Example: `1`

- **Text Chunk**:  
  The actual text of the legislation broken down into smaller chunks for use in ML models. Each chunk represents a portion of the original legal text.  
  Example:
