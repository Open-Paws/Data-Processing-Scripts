In 2016, DxE investigators openly rescued a chicken named Qing from a cage that had deformed her feet. 🐓 But their compassion was criminalised and ultimately led to the incarceration of animal rescuer #WayneHsiung last month. 🚨

🙌 Can the movement make this repression backfire? Can we turn animal freedom into an international debate? If yes, how?

We're gathering with Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), whose investigators were recently arrested for rescuing someone neglected and suffering, to reveal the answers to these questions. 🗝️ Cassie King, Communications Lead at Direct Action Everywhere, and 21-year-old UC Berkeley student and Founder of Happy Hen Animal Sanctuary, Zoe Rosenberg, will join the conversation to summarise what happened and detail the stories of Qing, Wayne, and three other DxE animal rescuers who were arrested on felony warrants outside the courthouse, including Zoe herself. 🏛️

During the webinar, Mark Westcombe from Animal Think Tank will discuss the importance of escalation and the backfire effect, providing historical examples, key learning points, and opportunities. 💡 Together, we'll contribute to the question of how we, as a movement, can be prepared to respond and build a larger narrative around events like this to potentially create a whirlwind moment.

🔎 And finally, our Narrative Researcher Natalie Braine gave a talk on our narrative work and shared the persuasive narratives our public research and testing has uncovered so far.

Our talks reached nearly 100 people 🚀, consolidating relationships with key players and laying the groundwork for exciting collaborations, particularly integrating narrative work into upcoming projects. It warms our hearts to hear that attendees found hope and direction in our discussions.

We participated in the Movement Unity panel alongside representatives of the Hunt Saboteurs Association, The Vegan Society, Plant-Based Universities and Plant Based Treaty. The panel had a lively discussion on the ways these groups are already collaborating and identified further opportunities to work together. 🤝 We left with some great new contacts and ideas to follow up with. 

On the panel, Tim Barford, founder of Vegfest, shared the exciting news that next year he's planning to organise a 1 day summit with the aim of further developing collaboration in the movement. He rightly sees movement unity as key to our success and power, as do we. ✊

Animal advocates face a conundrum. Our issue is highly emotional, yet members of the public are primed to see even mild animal advocate messaging as ’emotionally manipulative’, part of a common defensive reaction against pro-animal messages. So how can we convey the importance of our issue without being labelled as dramatic?

🐮 𝗔𝗻𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀 🐮

The Animal Abilities narrative focuses on the rich internal experiences of fellow animals. It shows that, similar to humans, they have unique abilities, personalities and feelings. 

🏳️‍🌈 𝗦𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 🏳️‍🌈

The Social Progress narrative communicates humanity's trajectory towards greater empathy and inclusivity. From the abolishment of slavery to the universal suffrage movement to LGBT+ rights, history is punctuated by moments when we've chosen the path of greater fairness and justice.

⚖️ 𝗠𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 ⚖️

The Morality narrative reinforces our ethical obligation to treat other animals with respect, kindness and compassion. At its core is the belief that causing unnecessary harm to another is fundamentally wrong. Drawing from principles like the Golden Rule – treating others as we would wish to be treated – this narrative encourages us to extend this basic ethic to all.

The goal of a social movement is simple: to change public opinion. But what exactly does the process of changing public opinion look like? The answer lies in momentum—a collective effort of many people taking escalating actions over time.🧏  It's kind of like a snowball rolling down a hill, growing larger along the way and attracting more supporters to the cause. 🚀

In a recent discussion with the Sentience Institute Podcast, our Direction Lead, Laila Kassam, PhD, elaborated on the role of non-violent direct action within the 'cycle of momentum', an organising model advocated by Mark and Paul Enger in 'This is an Uprising' to build mass protest movements:

She explained, ""Movements grow cyclically, and the cycle of momentum consists of three parts: 𝙚𝙨𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣, 𝙖𝙗𝙨𝙤𝙧𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣, 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙞𝙣𝙘𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙖𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙫𝙚, 𝙥𝙤𝙥𝙪𝙡𝙖𝙧 𝙨𝙪𝙥𝙥𝙤𝙧𝙩. When we talk about escalation, we're referring to the use of non-violent direct action to help trigger events. Multiple trigger events can create what we call moments of the whirlwind, or we can use non-violent direct action to be prepared to respond when trigger events occur naturally.""

While some participants in the Animal Freedom movement are fulfilling elements of momentum organising, a fully realised momentum-style social movement has not yet emerged. There is a question as to whether momentum organising adequately synthesises mass protest and structure-based organising to the extent claimed. Are there areas within the Animal Freedom movement that could fill this gap?

Recently, a whole community in Bolivia exemplified this by coming together to assist a stranded pink dolphin and her baby. The dolphins became a local attraction and the residents waved goodbye with flags and cheers as they were released into the Isiboro river. 🐬 ✨ 
 
Stories like this are powerful. They help people see our animal cousins as part of an 'us', rather than an 'other'. They reinforce many helpful narratives, like kinship, good neighbours, altruism and animal freedom. And they show humans living up to their values, which can help connect with people's aspirational identities and inspire them to do the same.

The Morality narrative reinforces our ethical obligation to treat other animals with respect, kindness, and compassion. At its core is the belief that causing unnecessary harm to another is fundamentally wrong. 🙅‍♂️

This narrative encourages us to extend this basic ethic to all. ❤️

And why we need the whole movement telling it.


""Dear movement leaders - We have a brief moment to come together around #Wayne's sentencing on Nov 30th to build a whirlwind moment and put factory farming's cruelty on trial. Wayne’s guilty verdict doesn’t have to be this story’s conclusion - it can be its start. 

As organisations we can all mobilise our press contacts to highlight the authorities' wilful negligence, the urgency of tackling the animal abuse in this case, the injustice of Wayne's sentencing and Qing's story of freedom.

𝐀𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐝𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐬 𝐰𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐮𝐦 𝐛𝐲 𝐬𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐧 𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐬.

We’ve all seen how a ‘backfire effect’ like this can work for a cause: Mandela’s 27-year imprisonment became a symbol of struggle and international attention; King’s imprisonment highlighted injustices faced by African Americans; force feeding hunger-striking suffragettes caused public outrage; Rosa Park’s imprisonment catalysed the successful Montgomery bus boycott; Aung San Suu Kyi’s prolonged house arrest drew international pressure; Gandhi’s arrests, Pussy Riot, Chicago 7, Preston 3, ... #backfire can lead to victory. 

Sentencing of activists, rather than suppressing movements, leads to press attention and visibility. Wayne is knowingly sacrificing himself. Wayne’s sentencing day is a rare opportunity to benefit from a ‘backfire effect’. But to reap these rewards we need a small collective effort from each of us to build momentum.

The suffering at these farms is not in question - they have admitted it on the stand. The question is whether the public is required to tolerate that kind of abuse, and whether we should criminalize actions to alleviate this grotesque suffering or not. The question is are we ready to act as a movement and as leaders, and to drive a widespread public conversation - we have 10 days.
 
This is our moment - let's seize it!""

From the abolition of slavery to the universal suffrage movement to LGBT+ rights, history is punctuated by moments when we've chosen the path of greater fairness and justice. 🏳‍🌈✊ Can framing animal freedom as the next logical step in our social progress be the answer? According to our latest research, the answer is yes. ✅

This #NationalStorytellingWeek, we're diving into the persuasive narrative of social progress. The Animal Freedom movement, whether aware of it or not, already taps into this narrative in their campaigns. 🎥 Check out this video from The Vegan Society, a brilliant example of the social progress narrative according to our Narrative Lead, Beth Thomas.

We asked our participants which groups they trusted ""a lot"" or ""a great deal,"" and the results were as follows:

𝐋𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐬𝐭: Corporations (13.5%), politicians (3.6%), the government (8.5%), and the government's enforcement of animal welfare laws (11.4%). 🏛️

These findings provide potential opportunities for our framing of the 'enemy’ in future messaging. Due to systemic shortcomings and a lack of accountability, the public is already inclined to distrust corporations, politicians, and the government when it comes to animal welfare.

Raku, a male orangutan, made headlines when he was seen chewing a medicinal plant into a paste and applying it to a wound on his cheek, which then healed completely within a month. This marks the first time a free-living animal has been observed treating an injury with medicine.

Biologist Dr. Isabella Laumer commented, ""I think in the next few years we will discover even more behaviours and more abilities that are very human-like.”

This story reinforces the 𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀 narrative, highlighting the intelligence and inner lives of our animal cousins. Our own research has found that this narrative is incredibly persuasive because it helps people build empathy and understand that other animals are very similar to humans in many ways.

This first blog post explores the narrative strategy of #FreedomtoMarry (FTM), which was a campaign to legalise marriage for same-sex couples in the US and has since become an international movement. 🏳️‍🌈

Freedom to Marry is a great example of a movement that successfully changed the narrative around same-sex marriage, and it has been one of the biggest sources of inspiration for Animal Think Tank in our narrative work. 💎

🔑 𝐅𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐬 𝐊𝐞𝐲

▶ The tension exists where a significant portion of people support animal freedom in principle but not at the cost of personal choice.

▶ The issue lies in framing—how information is presented shapes cognitive patterns and activates different parts of our brains.

▶ The challenge is to move people from avoidance and justifications to emotional ambivalence, where they are processing emotions about the topic.

🎯 𝐌𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐮𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐨 𝐂𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐜 𝐅𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐞

▶ There's a need to shift the conversation from a consumer frame (individual choices at the grocery store) to a civic frame (political engagement and voting).

▶ People's sense of futility often comes from viewing food choices as consumers rather than understanding the political aspects of their choices.

▶ Shifting to a civic frame involves combating civic futility, making people aware that societal change is crucial, and holding individuals accountable through citizen-initiated measures.

💙 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐄𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐨𝐱

▶ While messages often seen as emotionally manipulative may be met with resistance, the issue at hand is fundamentally emotional.

▶ Strategies for emotional appeals include toning down language intensity, using pictures to convey emotions, and defending the value of emotions as data.

▶ Facts are important but are strengthened when paired with emotional appeals. Numerical facts, provided with citations, enhance the credibility of messages.

To make the world better for all animals, we know we need to disrupt dominant narratives - but we also need to recognise that stories spread best when they resonate through networks, and when they shift the culture of social spaces. Drawing from a mix of theory and empirical research, Garrett Broad will discuss how the power of narratives can be amplified for animal advocacy, with a focus on the role of networks and the importance of place, across both physical and digital realms. 🌎 🕊

Wednesday 30 August, 4.30-5.30pm BST

To end animal oppression, we know we can't just focus on the symptoms - we need to understand the root causes. An Unnatural Order pulls back the curtain on how we've come to live in a society that has normalised animal exploitation, shows why all oppressions are connected, and discusses how we can move forward as a society. In short, it is the book everyone in our movement needs to read. Join us for this unmissable conversation! 

Jim Mason is a trained lawyer, journalist and author, and he co-wrote the book Animal Factories with Peter Singer.

Yet we live in a world where it is illegal to rescue someone who is suffering. And it is illegal because that someone is classed as 'property', and rescuing is classed as 'theft'.

Wayne Hsiung is in prison, waiting to be sentenced, for openly liberating Qing, a female chicken close to death, from a factory farm. She is now free, and he is now in a cage.

Wayne has just written his first letter from prison. If you're not already following his Simple Heart blog, you can do so here: https://lnkd.in/eZXt3-iN

Like Wayne, we believe open liberation of our animal cousins tells a powerful story to the rest of the world. It is a key strategy for our movement, as it forces everyone to ask themselves the question: Should it be illegal to help someone who is suffering? 

Change happens because of profound yet simple actions like this. Whether it's refusing to give up your seat on a bus or at a lunch counter because of your skin colour, individual actions can lead to social transformation. 

It's in our nature to help someone in distress. And one day, acting on our empathy will be protected in law, not punishable by law. Just as one day, fellow animals will be classed as 'someone' not 'something'. It's up to us to make this future a reality.

And why we need the whole movement telling it.


""Dear movement leaders - We have a brief moment to come together around #Wayne's sentencing on Nov 30th to build a whirlwind moment and put factory farming's cruelty on trial. Wayne’s guilty verdict doesn’t have to be this story’s conclusion - it can be its start. 

As organisations we can all mobilise our press contacts to highlight the authorities' wilful negligence, the urgency of tackling the animal abuse in this case, the injustice of Wayne's sentencing and Qing's story of freedom.

𝐀𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐝𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐬 𝐰𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐮𝐦 𝐛𝐲 𝐬𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐧 𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐬.

We’ve all seen how a ‘backfire effect’ like this can work for a cause: Mandela’s 27-year imprisonment became a symbol of struggle and international attention; King’s imprisonment highlighted injustices faced by African Americans; force feeding hunger-striking suffragettes caused public outrage; Rosa Park’s imprisonment catalysed the successful Montgomery bus boycott; Aung San Suu Kyi’s prolonged house arrest drew international pressure; Gandhi’s arrests, Pussy Riot, Chicago 7, Preston 3, ... #backfire can lead to victory. 

Sentencing of activists, rather than suppressing movements, leads to press attention and visibility. Wayne is knowingly sacrificing himself. Wayne’s sentencing day is a rare opportunity to benefit from a ‘backfire effect’. But to reap these rewards we need a small collective effort from each of us to build momentum. 
 
𝐓𝐨 𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐚𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐟𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰 𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐬, 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐰𝐞 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐝𝐨 𝐢𝐬 𝐦𝐨𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐬𝐞 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐦 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐭𝐬 𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞. 𝐈𝐭’𝐬 𝐚 𝐬𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐚𝐜𝐭 𝐢𝐧 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐨𝐧.
 
The suffering at these farms is not in question - they have admitted it on the stand. The question is whether the public is required to tolerate that kind of abuse, and whether we should criminalize actions to alleviate this grotesque suffering or not. The question is are we ready to act as a movement and as leaders, and to drive a widespread public conversation - we have 10 days.
 
This is our moment - let's seize it!""

Remembering the past gives power to the present. Narratives hold the transformative power to shape cultures and movements, and the Animal Freedom movement is no exception. In our upcoming webinar, we will dive deep into the rich history of animal freedom narratives and understand how they've evolved over time to become today's movement.

This is a space for us to reconnect to our purpose together and remember why we're doing what we're doing - our fellow animals. 🐖🐄🐓

It's a space to feel some of the emotions we tend to detach from in order to do the work such as sadness, grief and anger, as well as emotions such as love, joy, and reverence we feel for/about our animal kin and our connection to them. 🫂

It's a space to come back to our core, share and support. We love these sessions and wanted to share them with you too. 🫶🏻

Our Direction Lead, Laila Kassam, PhD, and Strategy Lead, Kangan Upadhye, had the opportunity to attend CSVN's first conference this month. During the event, we had the opportunity to share our ideas for building the power of the Animal Freedom movement and how our work at Animal Think Tank is contributing to this. ✊

♻️ We talked about the ecology of social movements framework, the importance of a shared strategy and narrative, and the power of social networks to shift social norms.
 
🎯 We presented our work on building a network of local campaigning groups, our strategy research, our narrative research, and our efforts to build narrative and strategic unity in the UK movement ecology.
 
🤝 We shared ideas for what the CSVN could be doing and thinking about based on these ideas. For example, connecting with the wider movement ecology, developing and promoting evidence-based policies to meet the government's climate, nature, health, and animal welfare goals, and scaling the network to normalise veganism in the civil service and build the network's power to effect wider change for animals.

We are deeply saddened to hear the heartbreaking news that Esther, the Wonder Pig, has passed away. 💔

Just the other day, we mentioned her in our Messaging Guide as a brilliant example of how our movement showcases the abilities of animals through one individual - and Esther was one of them. 🐷 She helped people realise that animals who are farmed possess just as much personality and uniqueness as any animal companion sharing our homes.

We're inviting you to our webinar happening next week today ⏰, which will address a very common issue every animal rights advocate faces, almost daily. Our issue is highly emotional, yet members of the public are primed to see even mild animal advocate messaging as 'emotionally manipulative,' part of a common defensive reaction against pro-animal messages. 🤨

Our guest speaker, Aidan Kankyoku from Pax Fauna, will answer the question of how we can convey our message by breaking down defensive reactions to pro-animal messages. 💯
