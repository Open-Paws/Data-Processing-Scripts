During our research, we have asked the public about their support for various farming practices. Opinions varied significantly, but chicken cages emerged as the practice with the highest support for a ban. These cages were viewed as having the least necessity and one of the highest levels of harm. Conversely, farming animals for food had the highest perceived necessity, the lowest harm rating, and the least support for a ban.

This highlighted an intriguing inverse relationship between perceived harm, necessity, and support for a ban. Specifically, the greater the perceived harm and the lower the perceived necessity, the stronger the support for a ban.

By targeting policies that already have high levels of public support, it should be much easier to mobilise around the issue and have the policy passed at a national level. Additionally, by emphasizing the harm and redundancy of cruel practices in our messaging, we can influence public support for bans.",2,19,,,2024-07-01T11:57:18.000Z,false,false,Photo,"Photo by Animal Think Tank on July 01, 2024.

Raku, a male orangutan, made headlines when he was seen chewing a medicinal plant into a paste and applying it to a wound on his cheek, which then healed completely within a month. This marks the first time a free-living animal has been observed treating an injury with medicine.

Biologist Dr. Isabella Laumer commented, “I think in the next few years we will discover even more behaviours and more abilities that are very human-like.”

This story reinforces the 𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀 narrative, highlighting the intelligence and inner lives of our animal cousins. Our own research has found that this narrative is incredibly persuasive because it helps people build empathy and understand that other animals are very similar to humans in many ways.

We asked our participants which groups they trusted ""a lot"" or ""a great deal,"" and the results were as follows:

𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐥𝐲 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐝: Vets, animal welfare charities, and animal rights groups (over 50%). 🩺
𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐝: Farmers (42%). 🚜
𝐋𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐬𝐭: Corporations (13.5%), politicians (3.6%), the government (8.5%), and the government's enforcement of animal welfare laws (11.4%). 🏛️

These findings provide potential opportunities for our framing of the 'enemy’ in future messaging. Due to systemic shortcomings and a lack of accountability, the public is already inclined to distrust corporations, politicians, and the government when it comes to animal welfare.

The registration link is in our profile. 

📌Changing the World for Animals: Narratives, Networks, and Place 
🗓April 17th, Wednesday 
⏰4:30-5:30 PM (BST)

To make the world better for all animals, we know we need to disrupt dominant narratives - but we also need to recognise that stories spread best when they resonate through networks, and when they shift the culture of social spaces. Drawing from a mix of theory and empirical research, Garrett Broad will discuss how the power of narratives can be amplified for animal advocacy, with a focus on the role of networks and the importance of place, across both physical and digital realms. 🌍🦢

💡 Are you ready to ignite change and elevate the animal freedom movement one narrative at a time? Let's begin!
⤷ The blog link is in our profile.

In this new blog series of Animal Think Tank, we’ll be analysing successful social movements and recent animal freedom campaigns from a #narrative perspective. Each blog post will delve into...

✍ the persuasive storytelling tactics,

🙌 pervasion of messages,

🖌️ content creation of a specific campaign,

🎯 actionable takeaways for animal freedom movement. 

This first blog post explores the narrative strategy of #FreedomtoMarry (FTM), which was a campaign to legalise marriage for same-sex couples in the US and has since become an international movement. 🏳️‍🌈

Freedom to Marry is a great example of a movement that successfully changed the narrative around same-sex marriage, and it has been one of the biggest sources of inspiration for Animal Think Tank in our narrative work. 💎

https://www.instagram.com/p/C297EpLhmsE/,"Can principles like the Golden Rule – treating others as we would wish to be treated – be applied for the rights and freedoms of animals? 🐑

The Morality narrative reinforces our ethical obligation to treat other animals with respect, kindness, and compassion. At its core is the belief that causing unnecessary harm to another is fundamentally wrong. 🙅‍♂️

This narrative encourages us to extend this basic ethic to all. ❤️

""The movie Speciesism is a great example of the morality narrative in action,"" says our Narrative Lead, Beth Thomas.

says one of the participants in our latest focus group. Meat-eaters often justify their behaviour by reasoning that animal consumption is ‘normal’, ‘natural’ ‘necessary’ and ‘nice’, and our groups were no different. 👤

💡 We have just dropped the first Narrative blog of 2024. Animal Think Tank performed 11 focus groups with the UK public 🇬🇧, and our narrative analysis revealed seven common narratives that kept resurfacing across conversation topics and across groups of people.

""Stories like in this video, which showcase other animals' many abilities, really help create a sense of 'us-ness',"" says our Narrative Researcher Natalie Braine. 

This #NationalStorytellingWeek, we're diving into the persuasive narrative of animal abilities. Not only the animal freedom movement, but people all around the world already contribute to this narrative to cultivate kinship towards animals. ❤️

From the abolition of slavery to the universal suffrage movement to LGBT+ rights, history is punctuated by moments when we've chosen the path of greater fairness and justice. 🏳‍🌈✊ Can framing animal freedom as the next logical step in our social progress be the answer? According to our latest research, the answer is yes. ✅

This #NationalStorytellingWeek, we're diving into the persuasive narrative of social progress. The Animal Freedom movement, whether aware of it or not, already taps into this narrative in their campaigns. 🎥 Check out this video from @theoriginalvegansociety, a brilliant example of the social progress narrative according to our Narrative Lead, Beth Thomas.

⤷ The registration link is in our profile.

Changing minds is the Animal Freedom movement's ultimate aim, but anyone who's ever tried to persuade someone will know that it can feel impossible. Uncover why this stubbornness helped us survive, why reason is not logic and the surprising key to persuasive conversations. 💬 Join us in exploring how we can harness these techniques as animal advocates, whether we're speaking one to one or to an audience of millions. 🔈

⏳ Space is limited, and our webinars fill up quickly.⏳

📌 December 18th, Monday
⏰ 6:30 - 7:30 PM (GMT) | 10:30 - 11:30 AM (PT)
⤷ Registration link is in our profile and story.

In 2016, DxE investigators openly rescued a chicken named Qing from a cage that had deformed her feet. 🐓 But their compassion was criminalised and ultimately led to the incarceration of animal rescuer #WayneHsiung last month. 🚨

🙌 Can the movement make this repression backfire? Can we turn animal freedom into an international debate? If yes, how?

We're gathering with Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), whose investigators were recently arrested for rescuing someone neglected and suffering, to reveal the answers to these questions. 🗝️ @cassie_dxe, Communications Lead at @directactioneverywhere, and 21-year-old UC Berkeley student and Founder of Happy Hen Animal Sanctuary, @zoe_rooster, will join the conversation to summarise what happened and detail the stories of Qing, Wayne, and three other DxE animal rescuers who were arrested on felony warrants outside the courthouse, including Zoe herself. 🏛️

During the webinar, Mark Westcombe from @animal.think.tank will discuss the importance of escalation and the backfire effect, providing historical examples, key learning points, and opportunities. 💡 Together, we'll contribute to the question of how we, as a movement, can be prepared to respond and build a larger narrative around events like this to potentially create a whirlwind moment.

🎟️ With less than a week remaining, register now and get your free ticket for this exclusive session.

So you contact the authorities, sharing photos and videos, so they understand the urgency of the situation. But they refuse to help.

What do you do? Do you walk away? Or do you help free her?"" asks Natalie Braine, our Narrative Researcher at Animal Think Tank.

📖 This beautifully written blog is available for you to read (⤷ The link is in our profile.). Learn more about why #WayneHsiung has been imprisoned, the story of the rescue chicken Qing, and how this open rescue by @directactioneverywhere  has sparked an international debate on animal freedom.

✊ We stand in support of @waynehhsiung and the recently arrested DxE activists: @zoe_rooster, Conrad de Jesus, and Rocky Chau. We hold #RighttoRescue, to help those who are suffering. ❤️‍🩹🐓

💡 Our Governance Lead, Dilan Fernando, ran an interactive workshop for those who want to do more to help animals and helped them explore how they could step into their power and contribute to the movement in their own authentic ways. 

🎯 Our Direction Lead, Dr. Laila Kassam, gave a talk on three key ingredients needed to build a mass movement that has the power to win animal freedom and how we are applying these in our own work.

Our talks reached nearly 100 people 🚀, consolidating relationships with key players and laying the groundwork for exciting collaborations, particularly integrating narrative work into upcoming projects. It warms our hearts to hear that attendees found hope and direction in our discussions.

We participated in the Movement Unity panel alongside representatives of the 
@hunt_saboteurs, @theoriginalvegansociety, @plantbasedunis and @plantbasedtreaty. The panel had a lively discussion on the ways these groups are already collaborating and identified further opportunities to work together. 🤝 We left with some great new contacts and ideas to follow up with. 

On the panel, Tim Barford, founder of Vegfest, shared the exciting news that next year he's planning to organise a 1 day summit with the aim of further developing collaboration in the movement. He rightly sees movement unity as key to our success and power, as do we. ✊

🚨 Like, comment, share.

""Dear movement leaders - We have a brief moment to come together around #Wayne's sentencing on Nov 30th to build a whirlwind moment and put factory farming's cruelty on trial. Wayne’s guilty verdict doesn’t have to be this story’s conclusion - it can be its start. 

As organisations we can all mobilise our press contacts to highlight the authorities' wilful negligence, the urgency of tackling the animal abuse in this case, the injustice of Wayne's sentencing and Qing's story of freedom.

𝐀𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐝𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐬 𝐰𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐮𝐦 𝐛𝐲 𝐬𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐧 𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐬.
 
The suffering at these farms is not in question - they have admitted it on the stand. The question is whether the public is required to tolerate that kind of abuse, and whether we should criminalise actions to alleviate this grotesque suffering or not. The question is are we ready to act as a movement and as leaders, and to drive a widespread public conversation - we have 10 days.

This is our moment - let's seize it!""

https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz67RL5L9bu/,"We were thrilled to have @paxfauna as our guest in our recent webinar! 📌 Here are 𝟑 𝐤𝐞𝐲 𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲𝐬 that shed light on crucial insights:

🔑 𝐅𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐬 𝐊𝐞𝐲 🔑

▶ The tension exists where a significant portion of people support animal freedom in principle but not at the cost of personal choice.
▶ The issue lies in framing—how information is presented shapes cognitive patterns and activates different parts of our brains.
▶ The challenge is to move people from avoidance and justifications to emotional ambivalence, where they are processing emotions about the topic.

🎯 𝐌𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐮𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐨 𝐂𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐜 𝐅𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐞 🎯 

▶ There's a need to shift the conversation from a consumer frame (individual choices at the grocery store) to a civic frame (political engagement and voting).
▶ People's sense of futility often comes from viewing food choices as consumers rather than understanding the political aspects of their choices.
▶ Shifting to a civic frame involves combating civic futility, making people aware that societal change is crucial, and holding individuals accountable through citizen-initiated measures.

💙 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐄𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐨𝐱 💙

▶ While messages often seen as emotionally manipulative may be met with resistance, the issue at hand is fundamentally emotional.
▶ Strategies for emotional appeals include toning down language intensity, using pictures to convey emotions, and defending the value of emotions as data.
▶ Facts are important but are strengthened when paired with emotional appeals. Numerical facts, provided with citations, enhance the credibility of messages.

This is a space for us to reconnect to our purpose together and remember why we're doing what we're doing - our fellow animals. 🐖🐄🐓

It's a space to feel some of the emotions we tend to detach from in order to do the work such as sadness, grief and anger, as well as emotions such as love, joy, and reverence we feel for/about our animal kin and our connection to them. 🫂

It's a space to come back to our core, share and support. We love these sessions and wanted to share them with you too. 🫶🏻

Our Direction Lead, Dr. Laila Kassam, and Strategy Lead, Kangan Upadhye, had the opportunity to attend CSVN's first conference this month. During the event, we had the opportunity to share our ideas for building the power of the Animal Freedom movement and how our work at Animal Think Tank is contributing to this. ✊

♻️ We talked about the ecology of social movements framework, the importance of a shared strategy and narrative, and the power of social networks to shift social norms.

🎯 We presented our work on building a network of local campaigning groups, our strategy research, our narrative research, and our efforts to build narrative and strategic unity in the UK movement ecology.

🤝 We shared ideas for what the CSVN could be doing and thinking about based on these ideas. For example, connecting with the wider movement ecology, developing and promoting evidence-based policies to meet the government's climate, nature, health, and animal welfare goals, and scaling the network to normalise veganism in the civil service and build the network's power to effect wider change for animals.

If you like our work there are several ways that you can support us. 💙 Find out how: https://animalthinktank.org.uk/support-us/

⚖️ 𝗠𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 ⚖️

The Morality narrative reinforces our ethical obligation to treat other animals with respect, kindness and compassion. At its core is the belief that causing unnecessary harm to another is fundamentally wrong. Drawing from principles like the Golden Rule – treating others as we would wish to be treated – this narrative encourages us to extend this basic ethic to all.

https://www.instagram.com/p/Cx-yv5VIOv4/,"How can we speak to the urgency of #animalrights issue without being dismissed as ‘melodramatic’? 🗣

Animal advocates face a conundrum. Our issue is highly emotional, yet members of the public are primed to see even mild animal advocate messaging as ’emotionally manipulative’, part of a common defensive reaction against pro-animal messages. So how can we convey the importance of our issue without being labeled as dramatic?

🙋‍♂️ Join us on Wednesday, October 25th, from 4:30 to 5:30 PM BST for a free webinar featuring Aidan Kankyoku, from @PaxFauna. He will examine these and other questions, presenting findings from years of research on public opinion and narrative in US animal advocacy, spanning a range of research methods from focus groups to randomised control trials with tens of thousands of participants.

The goal of a social movement is simple: to change public opinion. But what exactly does the process of changing public opinion look like? The answer lies in momentum—a collective effort of many people taking escalating actions over time.🧏 It's kind of like a snowball rolling down a hill, growing larger along the way and attracting more supporters to the cause. 🚀

In a recent discussion with the Sentience Institute Podcast, our Direction Lead, Laila Kassam, PhD, elaborated on the role of non-violent direct action within the 'cycle of momentum', an organising model advocated by Mark and Paul Enger in 'This is an Uprising' to build mass protest movements:

She explained, ""Movements grow cyclically, and the cycle of momentum consists of three parts: 𝙚𝙨𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣, 𝙖𝙗𝙨𝙤𝙧𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣, 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙞𝙣𝙘𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙖𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙫𝙚, 𝙥𝙤𝙥𝙪𝙡𝙖𝙧 𝙨𝙪𝙥𝙥𝙤𝙧𝙩. When we talk about escalation, we're referring to the use of non-violent direct action to help trigger events. Multiple trigger events can create what we call moments of the whirlwind, or we can use non-violent direct action to be prepared to respond when trigger events occur naturally.""

While some participants in the Animal Freedom movement are fulfilling elements of momentum organizing, a fully realized momentum-style social movement has not yet emerged. There is a question as to whether momentum organizing adequately synthesises mass protest and structure-based organizing to the extent claimed. Are there areas within the Animal Freedom movement that could fill this gap?

📍Online - register at https://bit.ly/3M25uZj (or search eventbrite.com for 'narrative change', the event will come up). 

More info: 

Narratives and worldviews make up the foundational ways we make sense of the world, find meaning and distinguish right from wrong.

In this public webinar, Beth will explore how we can change these fundamental beliefs to win Animal Freedom. We'll discover dominant narratives and worldviews in the modern world and the potential power of reawakening old ones.

This event is suited to anybody involved in communications for Animal Freedom and interested in helping to change the dominant narratives about other animals and our relationship with them.

https://www.instagram.com/p/ChSZ9pvMFnj/,"Launched in 2018, Animal Think Tank came together as a group of people determined to build a broad-based movement for Animal Freedom based on social movement theory and cutting-edge strategy.

Since launching, we’ve trained hundreds of changemakers through Movement Building workshops in the UK, US and Canada. 

We also helped launch @animal_rebellion, an ally to @extinctionrebellion, who are seeking to push the issue of animal farming and fishing into the environmental movement’s focus.

We are in the process of scaling up to a team of 25+ and preparing to launch a mass movement organisation for Animal Freedom.

If you are interested in joining us, give us a follow, message us or visit our website for more info (link in bio)
