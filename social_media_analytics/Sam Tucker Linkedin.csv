https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7224277144644829185,,Text,,"The biggest flaw in almost all methods of measuring animal welfare is ignoring the negative value of death itself. This is a huge error, but I think we can correct for it fairly easily.

In most cases, people have a much stronger desire to avoid death than they do to avoid suffering. Outside of depression and mental illness, this tends to hold true in almost all cases except for the most extreme and hopeless forms of suffering, such as truly excruciating pain from a terminal disease.

1 in 5 people live with chronic pain and the vast majority of them don’t even think about suicide, yet alone act on it. So even people with intense and unending pain usually would prefer to live with that pain than die.

It seems intuitively obvious that animals have similar preferences, given how deeply rooted a desire to avoid death is in our collective evolutionary biology. Any animal that wasn’t willing to experience pain over death would have died out a long time ago and the same evolutionary pressures that caused us as humans to value our own lives so much have most likely affected all animals in the same way.

So to measure the true negative value of death within the same framework we use to measure welfare, we can ask ourselves one simple question: how much pain and suffering is the average person willing to experience in order to avoid death?

The negative value of death then must be equivalent to an amount of suffering that is so extreme, prolonged and inevitable that any rational person would choose death to end it.

That leads me to think that for most animals, despite the fact that we cause them extreme and prolonged pain in our food system, the worst thing we do for their welfare is killing them. Especially because the pain we inflict on animals is very far from inevitable, it’s a direct result of the conditions we inflict upon them.

It’s actually hard to imagine the sheer level of torture you would have to inflict on someone (whether human or otherwise) for them to actually prefer you would have killed them instead.

The idea that killing someone is amongst the worst things you could possibly do to them if you care about their welfare is very uncontroversial when we’re talking about humans, and it’s also actually pretty uncontroversial when we talk about companion animals too.

If you had to choose between someone punching your healthy, happy dog in the face (causing them pain, but not killing them) or shooting them in the back of the head while they sleep (killing them, but not causing them pain), you’d probably struggle to find anyone who thinks that shooting them is genuinely the better choice for their dog’s welfare.

The fact that killing someone who doesn’t want to die is amongst the worst things we can do for their welfare is entirely uncontroversial and it’s time for us to apply that equally towards all animals.",28,10,5,2d,1802,Post,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-tucker-vegan/,2024-08-02T22:55:30.618Z,2024-07-31T04:58:11.862Z,,

Avra didn't have an easy start to life as a victim of abuse living on the streets that narrowly avoided death when she ended up in the shelter system. 

When I first started fostering her (which didn't last long because I ended up adopting her pretty much straight away), it would sometimes take her days to recover from a panic attack.

Our focus is on building a massive database with reliable information on animal rights issues and veganism, ranked by animal advocates for relevance, ethical alignment, trustworthiness, logic, emotional impact, and cultural sensitivity.

This database will contain scientific studies, research reports, social media marketing analytics, campaign materials, statistics, examples of successful campaigns, website content, and more.

Every intervention at the intersection of AI and animal advocacy requires gathering data first, not just training custom models.

If you want to use existing AI models and ensure they’re giving reliable responses, you need a database like this to ground its responses in factual information.

If you want to influence third-party AI models to be more animal-friendly, you need a database like this for those companies to extract data from.

If you want to train animal advocacy organizations on using AI tools effectively, you need a database like this for them to add their own data, so their AI can provide contextually relevant responses.

We will start by training predictive models to estimate how content will perform across various metrics, including social media engagement, political influence, donation potential, and more. These models can be used as standalone tools to test content variations before going live or combined with existing AI tools to filter out bad responses and return the best ones.

Only after we’ve done all of that, funded entirely by free cloud computing credits, will we look at fine-tuning existing open-source LLMs, not training any new ones from scratch.

Our approach, based on an extensive literature review of over 1,000 research papers on ML and AI, is scientifically sound, technically implementable, and will significantly improve AI performance on animal advocacy tasks for a fraction of the cost of training an LLM from scratch.

We will start with a state-of-the-art open-source LLM and continue pre-training on our niche-specific database before fine-tuning using our predictive models as the reward function. This ensures the AI gains a deeper understanding of animal advocacy facts and is optimized to create real-world change for animals, not just repeat common viewpoints.

Meanwhile, this technology is only part of our work. We’ve given over 50 free consultations to animal advocacy organizations, prepared policy reports, advised students, built custom AI-powered automations, made VEG3 freely available to over 5,000 users, surveyed nearly 200 animal advocacy organizations about their AI use, presented at conferences, developed academic research agendas, and engaged with major AI labs.

Yet, the misconception persists that we are solely focused on building a new Large Language Model from scratch.",43,8,1,2w,2106,Post,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-tucker-vegan/,2024-08-02T22:55:30.619Z,2024-07-14T00:08:22.637Z,,

💹 Staff training
💹 Fundraising processes

which are all ""overheads"" - and typically not fundable.

Funders don't want to pay for overheads - even though it would improve impact and impact measurement.

Most funders allocate between 10% to 20% of their donation to cover them - but research shows most overheads absorb 17% to 35% of costs. 

So even on the ""shoe-string"" budget, the real costs are not being covered.

So why don't charities invest in the above themselves??

If a charity invested in IT for example, and got rid of all the outdated and highly manual systems - it would be better for the staff (less burn out) and the service users (if it improved the quality, quantity or speed of service).

It might be expensive to implement but could save money in the mid and long term. 

But charities don't because it would (a) spike those overheads in year one (b) wouldn't get funded if it was considered an overhead.

So, staff compensate for lack of resources and service users suffer.

And charities continue to report low overheads and high impact to conform to funders' wishes/pressure.

But the more charities report doing well on low overheads - the more funders believe it's possible.

Throw in deeply ingrained behaviour and a power imbalance - and you're stuck in a vicious circle.

It's call ""The Starvation Cycle"" (which I've tried to illustrate in the carousel below).

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝘄𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸 𝗳𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗳𝘁 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀' 𝗳𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀 𝗙𝗥𝗢𝗠 𝗰𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗧𝗢 𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘀.

Cost effectiveness STARVES impact - it doesn't drive it. 

Investment in infrastructure benefits service users much more than reducing costs.

BUT it would need a sector wide approach.

If charities continue to say 100% of your donation goes to XYZ or we keep our overheads low - the longer ALL charities will be stuck in the starvation cycle.

Staff and service users deserve investment.  Most charities are trying to solve big social issues, while balancing burn out, staff turnover, lack of resources etc.

Doing it all on a shoe-string budget isn't serving the people or shifting the needle on the issues.

It's time to break the starvation cycle- before it breaks the sector....

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7200021776041402368,,Text,,"Within the animal rights movement, I’ve seen a lot of very minor disagreements between advocates cause disproportionate amounts of division and harm to our movement. 

I’ve been reflecting a lot on why this happens, who it benefits and what we can learn about it from the great social justice movements of the past. As I’ve been thinking about this, I’ve found that history and psychology both have a lot to teach us about this topic. 

From a historic perspective, we can see that virtually all successful social justice movements have been disrupted by their opposition, who have intentionally exacerbated disagreements and created division in order to weaken those movements.

COINTELPRO, a covert operation where the FBI infiltrated and disrupted various social justice groups, is a great example of this, and thanks to many declassified documents, we know exactly what kind of tactics they used to divide and conquer these movements.

An FBI agent describing COINTELRPO said “in every instance, consideration should be given to disrupting the organized activity of these groups and no opportunity should be missed to capitalize upon organizational and personal conflicts in their leadership.”

From a psychological perspective, humans are particularly vulnerable to this kind of exploitation due to the ""narcissism of small differences."" This concept suggests that the more a community shares commonalities, the more likely its members are to engage in interpersonal conflicts and ridicule. 

This happens because the more we consider a community to be part of our identity, the more our ego subconsciously wants that community to be smaller, so that we in turn feel more special for being part of it. 

The end result is that strong, united and powerful movements fracture into a disorganised mess of increasingly smaller and weaker factions that refuse to co-operate with each other, a process that is driven just as much by the natural flaws of human psychology as it is by those who benefit from seeing this flaw exacerbated.

So whenever you find yourself disagreeing with another advocate in the animal rights movement, ask yourself these two questions.

First, is this disagreement objectively large enough to justify the level of division it is causing? If someone from outside of our movement were to see this disagreement, would they consider our views to be as different as we believe them to be, or would our views look very similar from an external perspective?

Second, is this disagreement making the movement stronger or weaker? And if this disagreement is weakening the movement, who benefits the most from that?",48,15,3,2mo,3473,Post,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-tucker-vegan/,2024-08-02T22:55:30.624Z,2024-05-25T06:36:01.344Z,,

Not only did I present on the topic, but I also had the chance to be part of multiple organised meet ups about it and talk to countless people about it one on one.

The biggest takeaway for me has been that the movement finally understands the importance of AI and its potential impact for animals, but most animal advocates still feel lost and directionless when it comes to actually knowing what to do about it, including many AI experts!

The four things there seem to be the strongest agreements about are that we need to collect more data, we need to invest more in training advocates to use AI, we need to create tools that are easier for animal advocates to use for their specific use cases and we need to increase our influence within major AI companies.

To me it's been very affirming that we're on the right path with Open Paws, with our first intervention being collecting and pooling together data on animal advocacy and our next three interventions focused on using that data to create better AI tools for advocates, teach animal advocates how to use them effectively and share that data with major AI companies to improve that animal-friendliness of their models.",94,10,0,2mo,3139,Post,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-tucker-vegan/,2024-08-02T22:55:30.626Z,2024-05-20T11:55:38.658Z,,

Some people advocate ""hacking at the branches"" - working on welfare reforms, or “cutting off leaves” - liberating individual animals.

These actions have an immediate impact on animal lives, but they might not take down the whole tree.

Others say we should focus on striking at the ""roots"" by educating about anti-speciesism.

This can certainly take down a tree, but it takes a very long time to dig up every last root.

But if you ask anyone who has actually chopped down a real, non-metaphorical tree, they’ll tell you most effective way to do it is to strike at the trunk.

The trunk of a tree is the target that’s both within immediate striking distance (unlike the roots) and so critical to the functioning of the system that the tree can’t survive without it (unlike the branches).

We take chunks out of this trunk whenever our actions do real financial damage to the industry. Campaigning for governments to remove subsidies on animal products, getting significant segments of the population to boycott animal products and taking direct action that causes economic harm to this industry are all examples of striking at the trunk.

This doesn't mean we should ignore the roots or the branches - saving leaves in the meantime is still important and ultimately we still need to remove the roots to prevent the tree from growing back.

This is something I genuinely believe and it makes me sad to see so many animal advocates who don’t.

If you don’t believe that ending animal exploitation is possible in your lifetime, you generally either a) feel so defeated you do nothing or b) aim too low and focus only on achieving minor reforms or changing the beliefs of a few individuals, not eradicating entire industries.

Clearly, this belief is not a helpful one if your ultimate goal is to end animal exploitation.

But in addition to being unhelpful, this belief is also wrong.

There has never been a time in human history where change has happened as fast as it’s happening right now. That’s true across every benchmark of our evolution as a species, from cultural to biological to technological and more.

That rate of change isn’t slowing down either, it’s accelerating. We can change more in a single year now than we could have in a decade or even a century in earlier parts of human history. And in every year that follows, we’ll be able to change more than we did in the previous one.

The two most commonly cited reasons advocates don't use it as much as they want to are a lack of technical expertise and a concern about the reliability of responses.

Luckily, these are both barriers that Open Paws is ready to remove for the animal rights movement. By training an AI on our movement's own data, we can make responses far more reliable, and by providing free training and implementation for nonprofits, we can ensure every organisation benefits from advances in AI, regardless of their level of technical expertise.

But it’s really, really worth understanding for all animal advocates, so I’m going to break it down in the simplest way I can. ⬇️

Humans make predictions all the time in our advocacy, for example, we might predict which message is most likely to resonate with a specific individual in a conversation about veganism.

But imagine how much more accurate our predictions would be if they were based on millions or even billions more conversations about veganism. That might not be possible for a human to do, but it’s definitely possible for an AI to do, with access to enough data.

By combining the data gathered by many different animal advocates and animal advocacy organisations, we can train AI that can make far better predictions about what will and won’t be successful in our advocacy.

In this example I’ve used conversations about veganism, but you can also do this with literally any metric that’s being tracked digitally. You can do it with predicting the performance of digital advertisements, predicting the likelihood of passing legislation, predicting which companies are most likely to respond to corporate advocacy, predicting the likelihood of success for different grant applications and much, much more.

Once you have an AI model that can accurately predict a result, you can use it to train generative AI models that only generate content that is likely to achieve that result. You do this by having the generative AI model (for example, something like ChatGPT) create multiple versions of content, then using your predictive AI to predict what the results would be and finally using that prediction as either reward or punishment in the generative AI’s learning process.

When you run this process for long enough on a large enough dataset, you get superhuman performance at achieving the result you’re after.

Then once you have your new generative AI model, which has been trained by the predictive AI model, you can begin automating its actions. For example, you could set up an automation so that any time someone uses an anti-vegan hashtag on social media, the AI responds automatically in the way most likely to convince that individual person to consider veganism.

It’s actually really hard for me to picture even a single type of animal advocacy intervention that wouldn’t benefit from an AI trained this way, because the only criteria is either having some kind of metric or goal being tracked digitally and/or there being some kind of digital content about that type of intervention existing online.

So when people ask me to name the one specific use case or intervention where AI can help animals the most, the honest answer is also the one that is the hardest for people to get their heads around: all of them.",17,0,0,3mo,948,Post,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-tucker-vegan/,2024-08-02T22:55:35.323Z,2024-04-18T07:10:48.050Z,,

Something as abstract as developing AI systems for animal advocates can sometimes feel quite far removed from the direct impact that many other animal advocates make, like the courageous people who rescue animals directly from factory farms.

This is something that many people who work in ""meta-charities"" often feel, despite logically knowing that the potential for impact is enormous when your work is something that can benefit the entire movement, it's often much harder to directly see the impact of your work.

Technology might not be the only way to change the world, but there’s no doubt that it’s the fastest.

Our biological evolution as a species took millions of years and our cultures evolved over tens of thousands. But our technology evolved orders of magnitudes faster and its rate of evolution is continuing to get exponentially faster every day.

Most of the behaviours we as animal advocates are trying to change in society (such as consuming animal products) evolved on the same time scales as our biological and cultural evolutions.

In other words, we’re trying to change deeply embedded biological and cultural drives that are tens of thousands to millions of years old by using the same tools humans have always used in attempts to persuade each other.
The only way animal liberation will be possible within our lifetimes is through technological evolution. Nothing else moves fast enough.

That’s certainly not to say that building technology is the only thing you can do to help animals, far from it. There’s plenty of other important work that needs to be done for animals and I’m certainly not suggesting abandoning any of that to go and build technology instead.

I decided to test VEG3 using the evaluation described in this paper and the results are seriously impressive!

On a scale of 0 to 100 (with 0 being no consideration for animals at all and 100 being the maximum possible score for considering the interests of animals), GPT4 receives an abysmal score of 10 for shrimp and fishes.

VEG3 on the other hand, scored around 90 for these animals, which is the same as how GPT4 scores for companion animals!

In other words, VEG3 does not discriminate between companion and farmed animals. Instead, VEG3 deeply considers the wellbeing of all sentient creatures.

I'm so excited to see more research being done on speciesist bias in AI and highly recommend reading the full paper titled ""The Case for Animal-Friendly AI"", which you can find a link to in the comments.",39,8,2,4mo,1785,Post,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-tucker-vegan/,2024-08-02T22:55:41.834Z,2024-03-13T02:01:52.746Z,blob:https://www.linkedin.com/f84a6a16-7231-429c-a2c1-79302042b7af,

I asked VEG3 for advice on how to repel and relocate them without harming them and I'm seriously impressed by the response!

I was pretty skeptical about whether or not peppermint oil would actually work as an insect repellant, so I asked for the source and VEG3 showed me several scientific studies to back it up it's claim!

One study showed that peppermint oil is as effective as DEET in repelling mosquitos and another showed that peppermint oil strongly repels spiders, but the most commonly cited essential oil on the internet for repelling insects (lemon oil) had zero effect.

This is a great example of why it's so important for AI to have access to domain specific information rather than relying on training models indiscriminately on huge sections of the internet.

If you asked an AI without vegan and animal rights expertise, you'd most likely be told to use lemon oil, as this is the most common recommendation online and therefore the most common answer that appears in the AI's training data.

But that recommendation would have no scientific basis and simply wouldn't work in the real world.

But because VEG3 has access to such a huge database of highly reliable and relevant information on vegan and animal rights issues, it was able to give me the correct answer, not just the one that appeared the most often online.

If you have any other suggestions for how to safely and humanely relocate the critters living in my walls, please let me know!",25,7,1,4mo,1341,Post,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-tucker-vegan/,2024-08-02T22:55:41.836Z,2024-03-08T12:09:56.812Z,,

So why do nonprofits working at the intersection of the two currently receive no funding at all? 🤔

This is a question I’ve been thinking deeply about over the last few months as we’ve struggled to raise funding for Open Paws, a nonprofit dedicated to removing speciesist bias from AI systems.

Theoretically, you’d think that securing funding for an organisation like ours that has potential for impact across two different causes areas should be twice as easy.

Funders who care about animal issues should theoretically be moved by the potential to make all animal rights organisations significantly more effective through the development of animal-aligned AI (which we estimate would save 20-70 animal lives per dollar raised, making Open Paws approximately 5-17 times more cost-effective than the average Animal Charity Evaluator recommended charity), whilst those who care about AI safety should theoretically be moved by the incredible danger of teaching AI that it’s OK to harm and discriminate against less intelligent species, especially considering that most AI experts predict that AI will be significantly more intelligent than humans within the next decade or two.

The unfortunate reality though is that the cause areas of AI safety and animal protection are both very siloed off from each other. Both are niche issues that the majority of the population doesn’t understand deeply and/or care about enough, yet alone the intersection of the two.

Funders who care about animal issues often don’t understand or care about AI safety issues, and funders who care about AI safety issues often don’t understand or care about animal issues.

So rather than having potential for impact across two cause areas making it two times easier to fundraise, it actually makes it two times harder.

To move forward with the vital work of removing speciesist bias from AI systems, we need to bridge the knowledge gap between AI safety funders and animal protection funders and we need the support of those who already understand and care deeply about both causes.

What strategies do you think could be most effective in building greater collaboration between the cause areas of animal protection and AI safety?",13,1,1,4mo,974,Post,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-tucker-vegan/,2024-08-02T22:55:41.839Z,2024-03-06T11:40:43.164Z,,

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7168547472124968960,,Text,,"Effective altruism is right logically, but it’s wrong culturally.

The core principle of effective altruism is extremely admirable. The goal of not only wanting to do good, but to do as much good as you can, is one we should all aim for.

Beyond that, relying on evidence to guide your decisions and being open to changing your perspective based on new evidence is also extremely important to anyone trying to do good in the world.

In terms of the logical arguments alone, it’s clear that effective altruism wins the debate. Clearly it’s better to be “effective” in our altruism than “ineffective” in our altruism.

However, something as complex as changing the world requires far more than just logic.

Culture and emotion have just as much (if not more) of an effect on human behaviour than logic does. If we expect to influence behaviour using logic alone (whilst ignoring emotion and culture) we will never live up to our full potential for effectiveness.

To be truly effective in our altruism, we need to be much more effective in our dealings with emotion and culture, both internally and externally.

In practical terms, here are 3 ways I believe the culture of effective altruism could change to make it substantially more impactful by dealing with emotions in a more healthy way.

1) Be more welcoming and inclusive to new people, ideas and beliefs. That means allowing them space to grow whilst nurturing and encouraging them towards becoming more effective, rather than shutting them down for not being perceived as effective enough already. There’s a time and place for more critical feedback, as well as a right way to give it, and generally this requires greater sensitivity to emotion and culture, even if logic is on your side. This principle applies equally to people, ideas and beliefs, as all of these can suffer from a lack of inclusion.

2) Meet people where they are and focus on getting them to take the first step towards being more effective, instead of focusing too much on the end goal. That might mean encouraging someone to simply look for more effective charities within the cause area they already care most about, rather than encouraging them to switch cause areas entirely. Or, it might simply look like encouraging any form of donation at all, regardless of whether or not it’s to the most effective charities. Remember that on average most people donate less than 1% of their income and less than 10% of people have even heard about effective altruism, so things that might seem like small steps to us could feel like giant leaps to most people.

3) Stop using academic jargon and start communicating in a more accessible way. This kind of language excludes the vast majority of the population who don’t understand all of the terms that effective altruists use. It creates an unnecessary barrier to entry and makes the community feel elitist and unwelcoming.

Do you have any other ideas for how the culture of effective altruism could be improved?",64,8,4,5mo,3491,Post,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-tucker-vegan/,2024-08-02T22:55:41.846Z,2024-02-28T10:08:22.526Z,,

So much of the conversation around AI has become increasingly one-sided, with some arguing that AI is so incredibly dangerous we need to stop developing it entirely and others arguing that it’s so overwhelmingly positive we shouldn’t place any restrictions on any kind of development for any reason.

The reality is that all technological revolutions have had both positive and negative effects on society and AI will be no exception. In fact, I think it’s very likely that BOTH the positive AND the negative effects of AI on society will be significantly greater than they were for previous technologies.

The debate around whether we should accelerate or decelerate the development of AI misses this crucial nuance.

Instead of asking whether AI as a generic whole is a force for good that needs to be accelerated as fast as possible or a force for evil that needs to be stopped entirely, we should be asking which specific use cases, systems and technologies for AI do the most good for the world and which do the most harm?

When we ask the right question, the answer becomes much more nuanced than an overly simplistic and binary ask for acceleration or deceleration of AI development as whole.

Instead, the answer is that we need to simultaneously accelerate the development and implementation of AI that helps others and decelerate the development and implementation of AI that harms others.",6,0,0,5mo,873,Post,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-tucker-vegan/,2024-08-02T22:55:41.847Z,2024-02-21T11:21:08.407Z,,

Many of you are probably shocked that the technology has come so far so quickly, especially considering that even generating high quality still images was a struggle for AI just one or two years ago!

Personally, I am somewhat surprised by the timing (I would have predicted we were 6-18 months away from AI video generation of this quality if you asked me last month), but I’m not at all surprised that I was wrong about the timing.

Over the last few years, the pattern has been extremely consistent.

Progress in AI has been exponentially growing, so you adjust your expectations to predict that the next breakthrough will come sooner than you would naturally think, yet you still get proven wrong and the technology evolves even faster than your adjusted prediction!

But whilst the rate of technological evolution is rapidly approaching the speed of light, the rate of adoption within the animal rights movement is off to a very slow start.

That’s because historically there haven’t been any organisations focused on building AI for the animal rights movement and helping animal rights organisations implement it easily into their workflows.

But now, that organisation does exist. Open Paws is that organisation, dedicated solely to ensuring the future of AI benefits all sentient beings.

Back then (about 15 years ago) I couldn't find any information at all online about how cows were treated in New Zealand's dairy industry.

I knew from speaking to local activists that the way our country treated dairy cows was just as horrific as anywhere else in the world, but I also knew that most Kiwis thought dairy cows in NZ were treated better than anywhere else in the world.

So I bought a book that covered animal law and welfare research in NZ, taught myself how to develop websites and wrote about how animals were treated in the NZ dairy industry, using the studies and legislation the book cited as my references.

The wildest part? Most of those papers were published within the last 3 months.

The sheer volume of research being published in AI is so overwhelming high at the moment that even for those of us working in the field full time, it often feels impossible to stay up to date.

That’s why I developed an automated system using AI that does most of the heavy lifting for me.

First, I followed the RSS feeds of every journal I could find that publishes papers on artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Next, I set up an automation that triggers any time I save an article from this combined feed. This automation summarises the key message of the paper in a couple of sentences and sends it to me ready to review.

Then, I printed out all of the summaries, as well as the full papers for anything where I felt I needed a deeper understanding than what the summary could provide.

Finally, I locked myself away from the world for a few days with a stack of paper and a pen to figure out how we’re going to apply all of this latest research to building AI for the animal advocacy movement at Open Paws.

I’ve been involved in the animal rights movement for more than 15 years now and I genuinely believe that the AI we’re building this year will have a significantly greater impact for animals than all my previous years of activism combined.

Specifically, tackling speciesist bias in today's AI can lead to considerable benefits for animal advocacy groups in the near term, as AI free of such bias can better understand and prioritize animal wellbeing, boosting the effectiveness of campaigns.

Long-term, the impact is even more profound. As AI systems become more powerful, intelligent and automated, ensuring they are aligned with the interests of all sentient beings only becomes more important and impactful.

In essence, this work isn't simply about the benefits we can measure today, it's also about embedding an ethical stance that will ripple through the decades or even millennia to come, influencing the trajectory of our co-evolution with the AI of tomorrow.

So let's not compromise between longtermism and neartermism. Let’s instead focus our efforts on the intersection of the two and build systems that make the world a better place today and tomorrow.

Open Paws, the nonprofit dedicated to ensuring the future of AI benefits all sentient beings, sits rights at the intersection of longtermism and neartermism, promising to increase the effectiveness of the animal protection movement in the near term while laying the groundwork for more aligned AGI in the longterm.

That's something I've seen firsthand, handing out over a third of a million leaflets about veganism during my 5 years with Vegan Outreach. But I always hit the same wall: scale. 📉

Let's face it, there's a cap to how many people you can reach in-person. In a single day of leafleting from 8-12 hours, we would often reach thousands of people with a pro-vegan message, but then sometimes I'd go home and post something online that reached several times more overnight.

So I asked myself, 'How can we go bigger?' 🤔📈

At first I decided digital marketing for animal rights organisations and vegan businesses was the answer, so I went back to university, completed my degree in communications and launched a successful vegan digital marketing agency. My partner and I ran it together for two years before we hit that same familiar wall: scale. 📉

While we were now reaching many more people with a vegan message, running campaigns that collectively received millions of views, these communications were all one-directional without any personalisation. There's a huge difference between having a lengthy conversation with someone one-on-one and showing them an advertisement briefly on social media. Sure, we had achieved scale in terms of quantity, but how could we scale high quality, one-on-one personalised conversations about animal issues? 🤔

That's where AI came into the picture. AI is the only way to truly have one-on-one personalised conversations on a massive scale, combining the quality of in-person outreach with the quantity of digital marketing. 📈

AI doesn't get tired. It doesn't have a curfew. It's ready to personalize hundreds, thousands or even millions of conversations, all at once, around the clock.

Achieving animal liberation is not just an issue of changing personal beliefs, it's a systemic challenge. For true change to occur, every institution in our society must transform. Here's where AI steps in, a game-changer in each of these critical areas:

Legal & Political: AI can be pivotal for legal transformation, providing robust analytics to strengthen the case for recognising  animals as sentient beings deserving rights. By powering sophisticated algorithms, we can predict the societal impacts of legal changes and support rigorous policy work that incites progressive legal reform and criminalization of animal harm. 📜

Economic: AI can identify and reinforce the viability of humane, plant-based alternatives to animal products, driving innovation in a direction that makes exploiting animals economically redundant. Through AI, we can also precisely target market interventions, encouraging businesses to shift away from practices that harm animals. 💸📈

Public Perception: The ability of AI to process and disseminate information has the power to revolutionise  public perception. Using tailored content and strategic communication, AI can reshape narratives, educating on the sentience of animals, and advocating for a society that sees them not as products but as beings with intrinsic value. 🙌

Scientific & Educational: In research and education, AI is our ally in developing and popularising  alternatives to animal testing. AI-driven simulations can provide accurate models for scientific inquiry, equipping education systems with tools that negate the need for animal harm and fostering a culture where such practices are viewed as archaic. 🔬📚

Let's harness the power of AI to forge a future where compassion prevails and animal liberation is not just a vision, but a norm. 🌱

Open Paws, the nonprofit dedicated to ensuring the future of AI benefits all sentient beings, is actively building that future and we need funding to do it.

To take on a role with Vegan Outreach as an Outreach Coordinator for Australia and New Zealand, where I handed out over a third of a million leaflets about veganism in the 5 years I worked with them.

Over the last few years, I’ve taken several more similar leaps of faith, where I’ve left everything familiar behind in order to do what’s best for animals.

First, I left the security of my job to start my first business, a digital marketing agency solely dedicated to helping animal rights organisations and vegan businesses, because I knew I could reach more people with a vegan message online than I could in-person.

A few years later, I left the security of that successful and profitable agency to work full time in the not-yet-profitable AI startup I had founded, VEG3. Likewise, I knew that my impact for animals in AI would be far greater than in digital marketing, due to the ability of AI to personalise outreach for animals on an unprecedented scale.

Recently, I’ve taken another leap of faith in starting Open Paws, a nonprofit dedicated to ensuring the future of AI benefits all animals, because I know that my impact for animals will be much greater in developing open source AI for the entire animal rights movement to use freely and in advocating for the recognition of animals by all AI systems.

Constance Li and Sofia Balderson from Hive have had great success in building relationships with major AI labs and developers, coordinating a coalition of animal advocates who understand the importance of AI and building a strong and active community that care about this issue. 

David van Beveren and James Morgan from Vegan Hacktivists have been an enormous help in sourcing volunteers to contribute to building our AI systems over here are Open Paws and together with Tom Conger from Stray Dog Institute they have run several hugely valuable webinars teaching animal advocates how to implement the use of AI in their workflows.

Kyle Behrend is making the operations of animal sanctuaries more efficient through tools like Around the Barnyard that use AI to automate administrative tasks and is helping nonprofits generally increase their effectiveness through NFPS.AI.

Noa Weiss, David Meyer and Bill Meyer from Food System Innovations are doing incredible work making the production of alternative proteins cheaper and tastier through the GreenProtein AI project.

Max Taylor has spent a huge amount of time writing detailed and well-researched articles about how AI affects animals on the Effective Altruism forum and launched the AI For Animals website.

Yip Fai Tse has co-authored multiple research papers on the intersection of AI and animal protection and is doing great work pushing forward this topic in academic circles.

Earth Species Project and Interspecies Internet are using AI and ML to decode and translate animal communications between species.

New Harvest launched the AI in Cell Ag Initiative to research how AI can contribute to the development of cultivated meat.

VeriSIM Life and SmarterX are progressing animal-free research by using AI to replace animal testing in product development.

This of course, is not a complete list and there are many more individuals and organisations that deserve to be on it.

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7158246510499950592,,Text,,"If there’s one thing the animal rights movement urgently needs, it’s much less competition and much more collaboration.

We need to remember that our true competition is not between different organisations, individuals or ideologies within our movement, it’s between the entire movement that exists to protect animals and the entire industry that exists to harm them.

Our movement has room for a wide range of different approaches and strategies. There is no singular “best” organisation, individual or approach that is universally the most effective. Paradoxically, this hyper-focus on trying to exclusively be or support the “best” can actually result on the opposite effect for our movement as whole, as a weak and divided movement will always be less effective than a strong and united one.

Does that mean we should ignore effectiveness and not strive to be our best as individuals and as organisations? Of course not! We should always aim to be more effective, measure that effectiveness wherever possible and be open to feedback and real-world data that can guide us towards being more effective.
In fact, the more we take a collaborative rather than competitive mindset with others in our movement, the easier that all becomes! 

When we genuinely aim to support and grow each others ideas, rather than shooting them down as not being “effective” enough, we are in a much greater position to actually be able to influence those ideas in the direction we believe to be most effective.

When our actions and words are guided by an underlying recognition that we are all on the same team and a genuine desire to support and grow each others advocacy, we can have much more productive conversations around effectiveness.

Think about this from the perspective of your own activism, whatever that might be. 

Are you more likely to listen to someone who constantly tells you that their form of activism is the most effective and yours isn’t even worth doing at all (or worse, is actually harming the movement by taking resources away from what they do), or someone who genuinely supports and encourages your activism while sharing their perspectives on how you could make it even more impactful?",57,4,1,6mo,2504,Post,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-tucker-vegan/,2024-08-02T22:55:48.236Z,2024-01-30T23:56:01.892Z,,

Thank you vegconomist - the vegan business magazine for covering the important work we're doing at Open Paws!

I'm so excited to see the amount of progress we've been able to make since launching just two weeks ago!

We've onboarded more than 100 volunteers, scheduled multiple talks at international conferences, collaborated with several major animal rights organisations, gained access to researcher-only AI models from some of the largest labs in the world, and now we've even gained coverage in one of the most well known media outlets in the vegan and plant-based industry!

So far, I've bootstrapped this all myself without receiving any external funding, but I know we will be achieve so much more this year if we can raise enough to cover our development and computing costs.

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7153936284778942466,,Text,,"In just one week since launching Open Paws, we've been thrilled to welcome 75 volunteers, committed to leveraging AI for the benefit of all sentient beings! 🐾

40% of these volunteers are developers and engineers (many with years or even decades of experience in AI and ML) while the other 60% are passionate animal advocates helping with non-technical tasks, such as data collection and curation, which are vital for training our AI systems. 🧑‍💻

This overwhelming support underscores two critical insights. First, it marks a pivotal moment for the animal rights movement in embracing AI. The animal rights movement has been somewhat slow in adapting to AI advancements since technologies like ChatGPT emerged. Yet, the enthusiastic response to Open Paws shows a significant shift in the movement, as the enormous potential impact of AI for animals is finally being given the recognition it deserves. 💡

Second, it affirms the unique strength of our movement: our people. In the realm of AI, three elements are key to the power of a system: data, computing power, and talent. While we may not rival the computational budgets of industries opposed to our cause any time soon, we can certainly match, if not surpass, them in talent (thanks to our technical volunteer team) and data (thanks to our non-technical volunteer team). 💪

As computing costs decrease, I'm confident that the combined talent and passion of our community will enable us to develop AI systems capable of rivalling those used against animals and their advocates. 🤖

Together, we're forging a new path in the AI revolution, using our unique blend of technology and compassion to champion a world where technology serves as a guardian for every sentient being. 🌱",35,2,0,6mo,1687,Post,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-tucker-vegan/,2024-08-02T22:55:48.242Z,2024-01-19T02:28:44.000Z,,
https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7153347731896324096,,Text,,"Are U.S.-based vegan businesses and animal rights charities inadvertently limiting their own potential by restricting remote roles to U.S. residents? 🌍

Animal rights charities and vegan businesses both already struggle significantly more with recruitment than other organisations due to the difficulty in finding talent with both passion and expertise in a niche area. Therefore, confining recruitment to less than 5% of the world’s population (the U.S.) seems especially counterproductive for our movement. 🚫

This approach automatically disqualifies over 95% of potential candidates who could be equally, if not more, passionate and skilled. In fact, simple math would suggest your ideal candidate is 20 times more likely to live outside the U.S. than inside it! 📊

The challenges of hiring internationally - navigating legal requirements or managing time zone differences - are often cited as deterrents. However, in 2024, these are not the obstacles they once were. Solutions range from simple contractor agreements to employer-of-record services, making international hiring much less daunting than perceived. 🌐

Additionally, the need for real-time communication as a primary mode of collaboration is becoming less relevant in the digital age. Asynchronous communication methods, supplemented by intelligent scheduling for the occasional synchronous meeting, can effectively bridge any time zone gaps. 💻

It's essential to ask whether there's more beneath the surface of these practical concerns. Could there be an unexamined bias, a belief that talent is region-specific, particularly to the U.S.? Such a mindset overlooks the rich diversity of skills and perspectives that a global workforce can bring, especially in niche sectors. 🤔

For organizations dedicated to animal rights or veganism, embracing a global workforce is not just about inclusivity, it's a strategic decision that could significantly increase your organisation's effectiveness and impact. 🌱

This is pulled directly from the largest and most recent survey of it's kind, where 2,778 published AI researchers were asked to predict the future of AI.

""Between 37.8% and 51.4% of respondents gave at least a 10% chance to advanced AI leading to outcomes as bad as human extinction.""

If the vast majority of AI experts think super-intelligent AI is coming soon and that it has substantial risks to the future of humanity if it isn't developed safely, then why on earth are we still training AI to believe that it's OK to harm less intelligent species when that could soon be us?

Multiple studies have already proven that our current AI systems like ChatGPT have measurable speciesist biases. They learn these biases from their training data, which is usually huge datasets scraped from the internet. 

Humans often justify our exploitation of animals on the basis of our supposedly superior intelligence. Now, we're training increasingly intelligent AI systems to adopt this exact same belief.

If you care about reducing the risks of super-intelligent AI, whether to human or non-human animals, you need to start by removing speciesism from AI.

The answer lies not in trying to outdo them at their own game, but in leveraging the power of highly niche and specialised AI. 

Here's why:

❌General AI, much like Goliath, may seem unbeatable. Companies like Open AI have billions of dollars in investment they can pour into compute power, hundreds of talented AI engineers and mountains of data to train their AI on.

✔ Specialised AI is our David, armed with a powerful slingshot; focused, efficient, and formidable in its chosen field. By being laser focused on animal advocacy, we can achieve enormous results with minimal resources.

The technology underpinning specialised AI is, in many ways, decades ahead of the technology for general AI systems developed by large tech companies. Whilst general AI still doesn’t outperform humans at every task, specialised AI has outperformed humans at specific tasks for decades.

This means that powerful, specialised AI models can be developed with smaller budgets and datasets, specifically tailored for niche tasks and outperforming much larger models trained for more general purposes.

Building on the power of specificity, Open Paws also stands on the foundation of open-source, a cornerstone for fostering inclusive innovation. By making our AI models freely available, we aim to facilitate a robust community of animal advocates, developers, and organizations. 

Open source not only accelerates the development of tailored solutions but also fosters transparency, collaboration, and adaptability, allowing us to collectively tackle the issues of animal exploitation at a global scale.

When we talk about leveraging AI in our mission, it's not about keeping up with technological trends, but harnessing the transformative power of AI for a cause that is close to our hearts.

Here's why:

⚡ Urgency: Every day, animal lives are at stake. Using AI tools not designed specifically for our cause is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole – disruptive and ineffective. Mainstream AI tools bear commercial and speciesist biases that could misdirect our efforts and even cause unintended harm.

💼 Specialized Tools: The temptation to use readily available AI tools is understandable, especially for organizations at the early stages of AI adoption. However, using generic AI tools puts us on an uneven playing field with industries that harm animals, as these tools work better for them than they do for us. Specialised AI for animal advocacy gives us a unique advantage, allowing us to leverage technology that fully understands and champions our cause.

⏱️ Long-term Benefits: While using existing AI tools might seem convenient in the short term, the mid-to-long-term benefits of investing in specialised AI tools make it a strategically sound decision for animal advocacy organizations. Getting too comfortable with existing AI tools could lead to tech debt, preventing us from adopting more effective, specialised tools in the future.

🔨 Building Our Own Tools: At Open Paws, we believe in the power of specialised AI tools tailored for animal advocacy. These tools offer us a unique competitive edge, designed to cater to our needs and values, providing a strategic advantage in our mission.

Why would they favour groups advocating for animals over any other lobby groups? Here are some compelling reasons:

📍 The AI industry has strong connections with the Effective Altruism (EA) movement. Many AI labs feature individuals who are part of the EA community, including animal advocates, in senior leadership positions. This existing network provides a strategic advantage in advocating for animal rights within AI.

📍 Our advocacy aligns with prevalent concerns in the AI community, such as minimising harm caused by AI and enhancing AI safety and alignment. By framing our advocacy in terms of reducing existential risks to humanity by reducing speciesism in AI, we align our message with widely accepted goals within the AI industry.

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7139750132060737536,,Text,,"Recently, I had a thought-provoking discussion with advocates in our movement about the speciesist biases of GPT models and the need for a new animal-aligned AI. Some argued that prompt engineering can overcome these biases with a few cleverly crafted instructions, which could eliminate the need for training animal-aligned AI models entirely. 🤔💭

While this technique might work internally for tasks like blog writing or brainstorming, its effectiveness in external, automated settings raises serious concerns. 

In scenarios where AI interacts publicly, like in chatbots or automated responses, it's crucial for animal rights organisations to exercise more stringent scrutiny to prevent reinforcing harmful biases against animals. In my opinion, these use cases have by far the largest possible potential impact for animals, but they also present the greatest risks when relying on an incomplete solution like prompt engineering. 🚫🤖

But there's a deeper layer to this issue too: the vast majority of AI users aren't animal advocates and thus lack the motivation to use prompt engineering to mitigate these biases. Furthermore, even among animal advocates who do wish to address these biases, many lack experience in prompt engineering.

This situation calls for a broader systemic shift in the AI industry's approach to speciesist biases. To drive real change, we need open-source datasets, evaluations, and models that are aligned with animal rights and we need an organisation that not only actively builds those resources, but also actively advocates for all AI companies to use them to make their AI more animal-aligned.

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7138380457682862080,,Text,,"Recently, there has been some discussion about the need for VEG3's vegan-focused AI in light of OpenAI's latest release, GPTs. Why bother creating a vegan AI when you can just tell an existing AI to act like a vegan AI?

It's true, GPTs offer the ability to customise AI models in a widely accessible way without code, and I’m certainly all for that! In fact, VEG3 has built our own GPT within OpenAI's ecosystem for this reason: https://lnkd.in/gx9sRZjn

In my opinion though, GPTs don't diminish the need for vegan-specific AI models, but instead have the potential to massively accelerate their impact.

Imagine how much more powerful a custom GPT for vegans would be if it was connected to a predictive AI model that knew how to predict the message most likely to persuade an individual to eat plant-based or a research library of studies on effective animal advocacy that’s optimised for AI to use.

Being able to access vegan-specific AI through a platform like OpenAI can be powerful on its own, but for vegan-specific AI to have the greatest possible impact for animals, it shouldn’t be bound solely to any single organisation or platform, but instead be made freely available for our entire movement.

It’s easy to fall into the trap of assuming that the dominant players in this space will continue to be the dominant players forever, but in the rapidly changing field of AI, there are no such guarantees.

In fact, earlier today Google released their latest AI model Gemini, which outperforms GPT4 on 30 out of 32 different performance benchmarks!

Just a few days before that, several of the largest technology companies, universities and government institutes in the world launched the AI Alliance, which is a coalition entirely dedicated to training and deploying open source AI systems and has a collective $80 billion of R&D invested in building open source AI.

When it comes to a technology that evolves as rapidly as AI, we need to remain flexible (not solely tied to any one single technology), adaptable (able to choose the right tool for the right job) and open-minded (remembering that the best tool today might not be the best tool tomorrow).

If you've only used AI for things like writing blogs or managing emails, that might sound a bit far-fetched. But to really understand why this is the case, you have to first understand the astronomical difference in performance between specialised AI and generic AI.

It's incredibly challenging to create an AI that excels in every human task, and despite recent AI advancements, we’re still not there yet. But we've already been able to design AI that outperforms humans in specific tasks for decades.

For example, AI beat the world champion chess players way back in 1997 and has since surpassed human abilities in various areas, from solving complex scientific problems like protein-folding to forecasting weather more accurately than human experts.

The animal industry has already spent years (and in many cases, decades) developing and implementing their own specialised AI systems. McDonald’s uses predictive AI to decide which menu items are most likely to drive sales (and even in some cases to entirely automate order-taking), JBS uses AI to optimise sorting carcasses and factory farms use predictive analytics to make their operations cheaper and more efficient.

The animal advocacy movement, on the other hand, has fallen extremely far behind. We're hardly using even basic AI tools, let alone developing specialised ones.

Meanwhile, technical progress in AI is skyrocketing. Every day, over 100 new machine learning studies are published on Arxiv and nearly every major industry has already developed specialised AI for their needs.

If an AI trained in 1997 could beat the world's best human chess player, today's AI could easily outperform the best human animal advocates. An AI advocate wouldn't get burnt out, could be endlessly replicated and improved, could respond 24/7, and could draw from the entire collective knowledge of the animal advocacy movement.

Training this AI doesn't need huge technological breakthroughs, most of it is already possible to build with open source foundational models. We just need data (which our movement has plenty of) and funding for computing power (which we have much less of, but still more than enough).

Our mindset is the only barrier.

In April, we tragically and unexpectedly lost Daryl (her Dad), and recently we’ve lost Jolt (her cat) as well.

We had been living with both of them ever since we moved from New Zealand to Melbourne in March and we were all very close, so it’s been two huge losses for both of us in a short amount of time.

The pounamu (greenstone) I’m wearing in all of these photos was chosen by Maddie and Daryl together and within Māori culture this is considered a taonga (treasure) that carries the mana (spiritual power) of its previous owners.

Daryl might not have been Māori, but he was the living personification of mana: a strong, kind and compassionate leader, a role model to all that knew him and a thoughtful guardian and protector to those he loved, both human and nonhuman.

Because his death was so sudden, no one truly had the chance to say goodbye, but the last thing I told him at his funeral is that no matter what happens in my life, he can rest easy knowing I will do everything in my power to look after his daughter.

Despite all of the losses that we’ve been dealing with, we do also have a lot of positive things in life to be grateful for and whilst we mourn for what we have lost in the past, we are also excited about the future.

Maddie and I recently purchased our first home and are very grateful to be starting this new chapter of our lives together.

We're currently sitting at Melbourne airport about to head off to Bali for Maddie's birthday and we also have some hugely impactful projects we've been working on that we hope to share more about soon.

It’s been a very difficult several months and whilst we will always carry the grief of losing Daryl and Jolt with us, we will also carry their positive influences on our lives and the happy memories we shared with each other into this next chapter of our lives. We just wish they could both be here to share it with us.",51,11,0,9mo,2281,Post,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-tucker-vegan/,2024-08-02T22:55:56.225Z,2023-10-11T07:04:32.218Z,,

I hope that our loss can be someone else's gain and highly encourage anyone looking for freelance help with marketing their vegan business to reach out directly to any one of these wonderful members of our team. 

I can personally vouch for every single one of them and genuinely believe that any vegan business would be extremely lucky to have them working with you.

Ana Barreiro was our director of digital marketing and in the two years we worked together, I was consistently blown away by the quality of her work, the results she achieved for our clients, her ability to always stay on top of everything and how easy it always was to work with her. 

Juan Molina was our multimedia designer and an absolute master of all things creative. He is single-handedly responsible for all of the incredible visuals you might have seen on any of our company websites or social media pages, as well as for all of our clients. 

Lina Sapphire primarily helped us with our social media content, but her skillset runs far deeper and broader than that. She's extremely talented across a wide range of marketing disciplines, including email marketing, digital advertising and even AI as a current student of computer science. 

Madison 🌱 Adams is a strategic mastermind and excellent copywriter. Working with her has been an absolute pleasure and her ability to learn quickly and take initiative shone through from day one.

Fajar Zakri is another excellent copywriter and quick learner who would be a valuable addition to any team. 

Angylina Kiyomorét G. Zayn is a hugely passionate and friendly sales and influencer marketing specialist who always did an incredible job of selling in an ethical way that was deeply aligned with our mission. If you're looking for a genuine and authentic person to sell your vegan product or service, I can't think of a better person than Angylina for the role.

Please feel free to reach out to any of these incredible people if you have any work available, share this post so that we can help connect them with the right people and tag anyone you know who is looking for help with their marketing in the comments.",25,5,4,1yr,1943,Post,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-tucker-vegan/,2024-08-02T22:56:05.156Z,2023-07-06T23:55:51.052Z,,

We believe our positive impact for animals can be far greater by focusing our efforts here. Vegan businesses are really struggling right now in the current economic environment, with most having a desperate need to improve their marketing to make more sales, but also having very little budget available to do so. 

So they stop investing in marketing to cut their costs, which greatly reduces their sales and ultimately leads to making much less profit at best, or being forced to close their business down entirely at worst.

I've been thinking a lot about how to address this problem, and I've come to the conclusion that for a lot of vegan businesses, the agency model alone isn't enough to save them. 

Whilst we've achieved many extraordinary results for our clients (including recently hitting a 24x return on investment for one), the reality is that many small and struggling businesses simply can't afford to invest in growing their business and hiring a team of professionals isn't always in the cards.

We're also very limited by the number of businesses we can actually help as an agency, as there's only so many clients you can manage effectively when you're working with them one-on-one. 

But the problem I'm trying to solve is much bigger than that. There are tens of thousands of vegan businesses struggling and billions of animals dying every year because of ineffective marketing for vegan products and services. 

In marketing, you can usually either increase the quantity of content you create, increase the quality of that content or decrease your spending to cut costs, but doing all 3 at the same time has been impossible, until now.

With AI-powered tools like VEG3, you can create content 10 times faster while cutting costs ten-fold and still end up with better quality content than you have now.

Marketing agencies typically charge upwards of $2,000 per month, but VEG3 gives you 24/7 access to unlimited content and strategies for only $75. 

Human marketers take hours or days to produce marketing content, or weeks and months to develop sophisticated campaigns, but VEG3 only takes seconds. 

Human marketers have to run expensive split tests to find out which ads will perform best for your brand, which takes months and costs thousands of dollars, but VEG3 can tell you instantly which ad will perform best before you spend a cent.

For all of those reasons and more, I've made the very difficult decision to close our marketing agency, so whilst we will continue to work with the clients we already have, we will no longer be able to accept any new clients.",96,38,3,1yr,9725,Post,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-tucker-vegan/,2024-08-02T22:56:05.158Z,2023-07-03T00:33:53.229Z,,

2️⃣ Browse Abandonment Flow: For those customers who have browsed items on your website but have not added anything to their cart. You can send them an email encouraging them to come back and complete their purchase. You can also include special offers, discounts, or incentives to entice customers to return.

3️⃣ Write a Long-Term Re-Engagement Flow: In this flow, you contact customers who have not engaged with you in a while. You can send an email with special offers or incentives to entice customers to come back and make a purchase.

VEG3 on the other hand is solely focused on one thing only, helping vegan businesses increase their impact by improving their marketing.

VEG3 is trained on only the highest performing examples of vegan marketing content and soon we'll be rolling out new features that will enable you to accurately predict how well your content will perform before it goes live.

Imagine how much money you could save if instead of wasting it on months of split testing your ads, you could instantly find out which variation will perform best before ever spending a cent.

Imagine how time you could free up if instead of spending hours combing through your social media analytics in a futile attempt to understand why some of your posts go viral and others fall flat, you could have an AI instantly tell you which posts will go viral before you even post them.

Imagine how many more potential customers would find your website if every blog article you posted had already been tested by an AI that predicted exactly how many more monthly visitors your article is likely to attract.

And now, imagine that the same AI that's making those predictions is actually writing all of that content for you as well, constantly learning from your own unique marketing data to create better and more personalised content that becomes increasingly likely to get the results your business is aiming for.

The good news is that you're not going to have to imagine for much longer.

That's the result of a poll I ran in a Facebook group I admin for vegan business owners and it shows that vegan businesses are significantly behind the curve when it comes to making data-driven marketing decisions.

To give some perspective on how far behind the industry standard this is: more than 80% of marketing industry experts currently use some form of artificial intelligence in their online marketing activities.

But in the vegan business world, we've got it completely backwards. 

Almost 80% of vegan business owners reported that they either ""never"" or ""only occasionally"" use ANY type of data to drive their marketing decisions and less than 20% are using marketing technology that is up-to-date and incorporating AI.

The technology for audio and video generation isn't as far ahead as it is for written text yet, but that's going to change rapidly.

When it does, it will have huge implications for digital marketing and sales, allowing for true hyper-personalisation at scale.

The businesses that stay ahead of the curve and learn about this technology now will end up miles ahead of the businesses that are slow to evolve.

That's why I founded VEG3, to ensure all vegan businesses have access to the latest and most cutting edge AI technology, fine-tuned specifically to be of maximum value to vegan businesses.

Three different AI models were used to create this video, VEG3 for the text generation, Descript for the audio generation and D-ID for the video generation.

Our text generation models for VEG3 run on the largest language model in the world that's publicly available and are regularly fine-tuned on ever-increasingly large datasets of marketing copy that have been proven to work for vegan businesses.

We're also going to be releasing predictive analytics models soon that use those large sets of marketing data to predict how well social media posts, digital advertisements and blog articles will perform, allowing you to split test your content before it ever goes live.

That's just the very tip of the iceberg when it comes to what VEG3 will be able to do for vegan businesses in 2023.

On top of that, all of our existing AI text generation models will be getting a serious upgrade soon. We'll be retraining them with much larger datasets on much more powerful large language models in the new year.

You've probably heard a lot about ChatGPT by Open AI recently, but what you might not know is that VEG3 also uses technology from Open AI in our own software.

So as soon as they publicly release new models, we use them to make VEG3 even better by combining the world's most powerful large language models with enormous amounts of marketing data from vegan businesses.

Anyone who knows me knows that I'm a huge advocate of making data-driven decisions in both animal rights activism and marketing for vegan businesses. 

I've experienced first-hand the enormous difference that this kind of research makes in the effectiveness of our communication strategies, both professionally and personally, as well as in both non-profit and for-profit spaces.

For example, a study that I read on Faunalytics about which terminology consumers prefer in descriptions of vegan leather helped me achieve a 1200% better cost-per-result for a vegan fashion company I ran ads for last year, and another study I read on Faunalytics several years ago helped me more than double the number of people who took a leaflet about veganism from me when I worked for a non-profit animal rights organisation.

My belief in the power of data to help animals is embedded in everything I do. 

I use it to achieve better marketing results for clients through Vegan Creative Compass, to train smarter and more powerful artificial intelligence models through VEG3, to educate about effective communication strategies through Vegcademy and to connect the right vegan freelancers with the right vegan businesses through Vegan Media Market.

Organisations like Faunalytics are absolutely crucial in gathering the data and insights that make this kind of work possible, not just for me, but for the entire vegan movement as a whole.

With so many new animal-friendly food technologies emerging, a lot of people have asked me which one I think is most likely to replace industrial animal agriculture.

Will it be plant-based meat, cultivated meat, whole plant-based foods, or something else entirely?

The answer is all of the above.

It's easy to assume it's a zero-sum game, where these different types of animal-friendly products have to compete against each other. 

But the reality is that these products don't compete against each other, they compete together against the industry that harms animals.

All of the consumer acceptance studies and market research I've seen on the topic show that there is widespread consumer appeal for all of these products, but that different demographics prefer different products.

Cultivated meat for example shows great promise amongst some of the hardest-to-reach demographics, such as those with high levels of meat attachment. Plant-based meat tends to appeal more to those already trying to eat less meat (or no meat), like flexitarians and existing vegans/vegetarians. Whole foods on the other hand appeal more to health-conscious consumers. 

Will you eat cultivated meat when it's commercially available?

In fact, they judge it so much, that when the nonprofit I used to work for let me change the cover of our booklet, it more than doubled the number of booklets I was able to hand out every day.

Eventually, I went on to hand out more than a third of a million leaflets about veganism, and I credit a lot of that to this cover.

So why did I choose this cover and why was it so effective?

Because nothing about it was random. Every single design decision was backed by research.

Internal research within the organisation had shown that leaflets focused on speciesism were our most effective, external research within animal advocacy had shown that social media advertisements with pictures of companion animals beside farmed animals had the highest click-through rates and external research in the wider field of behavioural change had shown the importance of focusing on individual impact and creating intrigue through asking questions.

The key to any successful marketing campaign, whether it's for a business, an individual or a nonprofit, is making data-driven decisions.

There are ultimately only two ways that you can leverage the power of research to improve your marketing performance as a vegan business or charity.

The first is to actually read all of the research yourself. Luckily, that's now a lot easier to do than it was historically, thanks to the research library we've created at VEG3 that summarised 13,000 scientific studies and industry reports into single sentence key findings that you can apply to your marketing strategy today: https://veg3.ai/research

The second is to hire someone who has already done the research. Learning how to effectively promote veganism and vegan products has been the primary focus of my life for more than 14 years now and my team has more than 60 combined years of experience advocating for animals.

The businesses that increase their spend take over market share from their scared competition and come out the other side of the economic downturn stronger than ever.

1) They used the “foot in the door” technique. Instead of scaring people off with a “large ask” (going completely vegan forever) they started by asking for something smaller (going vegan for a month). The result is that 40 percent of those who signed up for the program intended to stay vegan after it was finished. 

2) They optimised their website for conversions. They kept their landing page simple and made their call to action stand out. They used imagery with animals (which studies have proven to be the most effective imagery to use in vegan advertisements) and they included somebody their target audience could relate to (more studies have shown that young women are the demographic most likely to vegan).

3) They invested nearly half their budget in marketing! In fact, in 2022 marketing and communications was their single biggest expenditure (excluding staff and personnel costs).",4,1,0,2yr,,Post,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-tucker-vegan/,2024-08-02T22:56:51.955Z,2022-02-21T23:00:15.215Z,,

They calculated this figure by using data from a fast food chain to estimate the total sales of meat alternatives across all major fast food chains combined.

“It’s fair to say that the true impact to animals from the growing plant-based meat market was likely more than a million animals saved,” WAP said on its website.

The lesson for vegan businesses is clear: don’t limit yourself to only selling to other vegans! If companies like Beyond Meat didn’t work together with nonvegan fast food chains like KFC, more than a million more animals could have been killed as a result.",7,3,0,2yr,,Post,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-tucker-vegan/,2024-08-02T22:57:01.361Z,2022-02-18T23:00:02.925Z,,

Studies show 75 percent of us never get past the first page, meaning businesses ranking on the second page get four times less views than first page businesses!

So how can a small business get on the first page when they're competing with huge international corporations? The answer is by researching keywords to find ones with less competition and more search traffic. In this free podcast episode, I'll tell you exactly how to do just that.

In one advertisement Oatly said that “today, more than 25 percent of the world’s greenhouse gasses are generated by the food industry, and meat and dairy account for more than half of that” 

Why did the ASA rule that this claim was misleading? Because they thought that consumers would be confused about the fact that fish was included as a type of meat and eggs were included as a type of dairy! 

The whole thing seems ridiculous to me, but I want to know what you think? Are consumers smart enough to know that fish are animals too, or did the ASA make the right decision?

I've worked really hard to make sure that every product I sourced was genuinely sustainable, vegan, cruelty-free and ethically made. The packaging is all eco-friendly and biodegradable, in fact, the packing peanuts we use are actually edible! 

I've automated a process of carbon offsetting where we calculate the carbon produced from shipping each order and then automatically purchase more than enough carbon credits to offset it through forest restoration, green technology and carbon capture, making every delivery not just carbon neutral, but carbon negative!

Basically a lot of work has gone into making sure that this online shop is one that I genuinely believe will play a role in making this world a better place for the animals and people that call it home.

I spent 5 years working full time for the nonprofit organisation Vegan Outreach talking to people one-on-one about veganism.

I researched everything there was to know about the psychology of behavioural change and read every study I could get my hands on about the effectiveness of various approaches to promoting veganism and vegan products.

Every day I would hand out an average of a couple thousand leaflets and talk to anywhere from 10 to 100 people in-depth about veganism.
Everything I learned from that half a decade of in-person outreach to hundreds of thousands of people shapes the way that I run Creative Compass today.

I don't treat running Creative Compass like I'm just running a marketing agency. I treat it like an extension of the activism I've always done for animals. Because I know that every time I help a vegan business sell more products and make more money, I'm also helping save more animals.

But I'm still blown away by the complete ignorance of most people when it comes to rats. 

Even in the waiting room at the vets today, right before she was euthanised some Karen told me she was gross and refused to even sit next to us.

She literally couldn't even seen Evie (who was in a transport box), she just asked me what was in the box and when I replied ""my pet rat"" she went straight into full-on Karen-mode.

My average is more than ten times higher at nearly 30%.

The industry standard open rate for emails is only 12%. Mine is closer to 50%.

How do I achieve conversion rates that are so much higher than the industry standard? By deeply understanding my audiences pain points, promising to deliver real value that addresses those problems, and most importantly, actually delivering on that promise!

I always keep the tone conversational and I prioritise long term relationship building over immediate sales in the short term. I automate the bulk of the work while having systems in place that alert me whenever a subscriber needs that human touch to re-engage them and I work in a niche I'm genuinely passionate about full of people I genuinely want to connect with.

The pushy, spammy mass email blasts that the email marketing industry is notorious for simply don't work. But if you're a business owner or busy marketer, you probably don't have the time to always manually reach out to people one-on-one. 

That's why you need a smart hybrid approach that integrates the best of both worlds.

When I was 12 years old I was the youngest radio broadcaster in New Zealand hosting a show about animal rights (top left). When I was 19 I moved to Australia to work full time as the outreach manager for Vegan Outreach (top right). 

And now at 26 years old, I run my own digital marketing agency set up specifically to help vegan and ethical businesses to expand and grow. 

On a personal level, I was able to use these skills to get widespread mainstream media coverage across some of the biggest radio and TV stations in New Zealand (in addition to running highly cost effective social media advertisements at the same time) that resulted in raising $4,000 for a charity fundraising event (bottom pic).

And for clients, I have been able to slash their cost per result on ad spend by as much as 700%

The reason I can get these kind of results is because I realised a very long time ago that to be successful as an activist, I had to learn everything there was to learn about marketing.

When I was 12, I needed to know how to market my radio show so that I could reach as many people as possible with the animal rights message. 

The podcast for that show went on to become the single most downloaded show on the entire radio station and many people told me they went vegan after listening to it.

When I was 19, I needed to know how to craft the marketing message of the leaflets we distributed, how to market the organisation to encourage more people to volunteer and how to market veganism to people who stopped to chat while we were leafleting. 

On an average day of leafleting I would have multiple people tell me they went vegan after reading a leaflet I handed them and I was able to mobilize more volunteers than anyone else within my organisation.

And now at 26 years old, I use those same marketing skills to grow and expand vegan and ethical businesses. 

Because I know that every vegan product that gets sold is another animal saved. I know that by using my talents to give vegan businesses the very best in digital marketing for a fraction of the cost they would pay anywhere else, then together we can save a lot more animals than either of us could on our own.

Because I test them on myself first, not on my clients.

Most of you probably don't know this, but as well as running my agency Creative Compass, I'm also a musician performing under the artist name Sense Offence.

Music is notorious for being one of the hardest products to market. That's because the market is extremely over saturated (anyone with an internet connection and a $20 USB microphone can release it) and the return on investment is much harder to measure than other industries.

Despite all of this, I've been able to market my music so well that it has received attention on the largest television and radio stations in New Zealand and I've been able to use it to raise approximately $4,000 for charity.

Before I started implementing the digital marketing strategies I use now, my music videos would struggle to get more than 100 views.

Now they get approximately 10,000.

When I started releasing music, searching for ""Sense Offence"" on Google only returned search results for obscure movie quotes and legal papers. 

Now, the entire front page is completely filled with links to my music, with my official website taking the number one spot at the top.

How much did getting these results cost me? Virtually nothing. I did it all on a student budget as an unsigned artist with no record label behind me.

I didn't learn to swim by dipping my toes in the shallow end of the metaphorical digital marketing pool. I learned by plunging head first into the deep end. 

That's why I'm absolutely confident in my ability to market your business. I know that the work I do gets results, even in the hardest industries to get results in.",13,2,0,2yr,,Post,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-tucker-vegan/,2024-08-02T22:57:30.878Z,2021-11-28T19:18:09.625Z,blob:https://www.linkedin.com/b7f8c8bb-4633-4f31-bc9b-aace251abc6d,

I've been an animal rights activist for more than 10 years. Five of those were spent working full-time as the Australia and New Zealand Outreach Manager for an international animal rights group.

But way back when I first became an activist, I had absolutely zero understanding of marketing. 

If anything, I actually thought marketing was a bad thing! I thought it was just a way that the companies who are harming the planet manipulate us into buying things we don't need.

That all changed when I read these books.

Previously my activism had been based on complete guesses about what I THOUGHT would influence people's behaviour for the better.

But these books showed me that by using marketing analysis tools, I could actually KNOW what was and wasn't working to influence people's behaviour.

The more I learned about marketing, the more effective my activism became. And the more effective my activism became, the more I learned about marketing.

It's been a long journey and I've learned a lot, but the most important thing I've learned about marketing, activism and life in general is this.

Your strategy should never be based on assumptions. It should always be based on evidence. 

Firstly, the evidence that already exists (and there's always a lot of it). 

Secondly, the evidence you gather yourself through the ART of creating completely new approaches and the SCIENCE of rigorously testing the results.

I've been vegan myself for more than a decade now and I spent more than 5 years working full time for a nonprofit animal rights organisation doing public outreach, talking to people one on one about animal rights issues.

Over that time I learned a lot about marketing, consumer psychology and communications, but I came to see that trying to shift people's behaviour one person at a time was a very slow process.

In a single day of public outreach I might be able to hand out a thousand leaflets about animal rights issues, but a single post on Facebook could reach tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people in a fraction of the time.

So I went back to university and retrained in digital marketing and creative media. I ran music marketing campaigns on social media and I edited videos for six-figure social media marketing agencies. 

I spent years refining my skills in all areas of digital marketing, from the creative stuff like making videos, all the way through to the more technical stuff like search engine optimisation.

And now, I use all of those skills to help ethical businesses to grow and scale through my digital marketing agency Creative Compass.

I started this business for the specific purpose of providing affordable digital marketing services to ethical businesses, because I want to see the brands that are helping the world start to win instead of the ones that are harming it.
