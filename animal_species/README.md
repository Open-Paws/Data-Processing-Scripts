# Animal Species Datasets

This repository contains a filtered version of the Catalogue of Life (CoL) dataset, focusing on the kingdom Animalia, and a list from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO) of domesticated animals and breeds. Additionally, a Python script used to filter the CoL dataset is provided.

## Dataset Descriptions

### 1. Animalia Filtered Dataset

This dataset is a subset of the larger Catalogue of Life (CoL) dataset. It has been filtered to include only species within the kingdom Animalia. The original CoL dataset is a comprehensive global database of known species of plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms.

The original Catalogue of Life dataset is licensed under the Catalogue of Life Data Use Agreement. The filtered version provided here inherits the same license conditions. You are free to use, modify, and distribute this dataset provided you adhere to the terms of the Catalogue of Life Data Use Agreement.

### 2. UN FAO Domesticated Animals Dataset

This dataset lists domesticated animals and breeds according to the UN FAO. It provides information about various domesticated species used in agriculture and farming.

The UN FAO data is typically made available under open access terms for educational and non-commercial use. Please refer to the UN FAO Data Use and Licensing Policy for specific details and any restrictions.

## Python Script

### Filter Script

This Python script was used to filter the original Catalogue of Life dataset to produce the animalia filtered dataset file. The script reads the original CoL dataset, applies filters to retain only records under the kingdom Animalia, and saves the filtered dataset to a new CSV file.
