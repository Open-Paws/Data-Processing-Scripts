By law we are unable to donate any products that have gone past their ‘use by’ date but this is an area the industry is doing some research into. As a largely chilled business this is especially pertinent to us and is of particular interest. Having said this, the current categories of donated products represent up to 45% of our daily waste units. Whilst we’re doing as much as possible to reduce the amount of waste we create in the first place and redistributing what we can there is inevitably a residual portion of waste. This is sent to anaerobic digestion plants. This ultimately creates electricity some of which MS buys back for its own energy supply and produces digestate which can be used as a fertiliser.",GB0031274896

These schemes can redistribute surplus food from the back of our stores to a wide range of charities that cook for those in need and are on the frontline of dealing with food poverty. We have been running a number of trials across the country (operating in 45 stores) to establish the best model for getting our surplus food to those who need it whilst maintaining our visibility and traceability of these items. As a result, from October 2015 we commenced roll out of a nationwide charitable redistribution scheme using Neighbourly as a platform connecting every store with existing and new local charity partners to maximise the amount of food that can be redistributed.",GB0031274896

By law we are unable to donate any products that have gone past their ‘use by’ date but this is an area the industry is doing some research into. As a largely chilled business this is especially pertinent to us and is of particular interest. Having said this, the current categories of donated products represent up to 45% of our daily waste units. Whilst we’re doing as much as possible to reduce the amount of waste we create in the first place and redistributing what we can there is inevitably a residual portion of waste. This is sent to anaerobic digestion plants. This ultimately creates electricity some of which MS buys back for its own energy supply and produces digestate which can be used as a fertiliser.",GB0031274896
