The Board oversees the effectiveness of Coles’ environment,
sustainability and governance policies and retains ultimate oversight
of material environmental and sustainability risks and opportunities,
including those related to climate change. The Board is supported by
the Audit and Risk Committee.
The Board has endorsed the Group Sustainability Steering
Committee as the management group responsible for overseeing
the Group-wide identification and response to sustainability issues.
As climate change is recognised as having wide-ranging implications
for our business, responsibilities for managing and mitigating
climate-related risks are Group-wide. The Group Sustainability
Steering Committee coordinates this response through a specific
Climate Change Subcommittee, which oversees Coles’ climate
change approach and reports to the Sustainability Steering
Committee and its Chair.
Ultimately, Coles Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,
supported by the Chief Sustainability, Property & Export Officer
(Chair of the Group Sustainability Steering Committee), has
accountability for ensuring climate-related risks are identified,
assessed and appropriately managed.",https://wikirate.org/~16368304,19662766.0,https://zerotracker.net/,2.0,,US1938704095

They do not report an exact figure but do say that 97% supplier and 93% of factories were registered on Sedex (Supplier Ethical Data Exchange: a global supply chain management platform). Sedex requires participants to perform a risk assessment, if risk is medium or high an independent audit will be conducted. If any issues are found through the ethical audit, then required to remediate the issue. If this is not done, Coles Group will suspend supply and reserve the right to terminate that company/factory's trading agreement. Therefore, there are sufficient steps to ensure that new suppliers are being screened and continuously analysed for labour practices that do not align with GRI criteria.
