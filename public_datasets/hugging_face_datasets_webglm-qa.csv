What is fake meat made of and how do they get the texture to be so similar to real meat?,"Fake meat is often made from plant proteins such as soy, wheat gluten, and tofu[2][4]. The texture of fake meat is achieved by breaking down the proteins and reshaping them with a food extruder or by using wet extrusion processes[4]. Lastly, food manufacturers season the faux meat to mimic the flavors and textures of real meat[3].","['Fake meat is often associated with a tough, flavorless texture that is added to dishes to provide protein. However, fake meat is no longer just glutinous balls or tofu hidden beneath sauces. From plant protein derived meats to in vitro preparations, there is much more to synthetic meat than what meets the tongue.', 'The existence of realistic fake meat products raises interesting questions about what meat really is. When we say we love meat are we really talking about a set of nutrients? A certain flavour or texture? Or a set of cultural memories of shared meals such as Christmas turkey and Easter lamb? A culture that is much more advanced along the fake meat route is China, where for centuries Buddhist cooks have made ingenious “roast goose” and “duck” and even “intestines” from layers of wheat gluten and tofu. Chinese food expert Fuchsia Dunlop tells me that the “bleeding’ burgers” of modern-day Britain “have the same purpose as Chinese Buddhist imitation meats”, of enabling people to eat vegan food without making dramatic changes to their eating habits. The difference, she notes, is that traditional Chinese fake meats tend to be made from tofu, mushrooms and other ordinary ingredients, whereas some of the new fake meats of the west “are manufactured with possibly unhealthy additives”. And this is where the huge and ever-growing enthusiasm for fake meat becomes somewhat tricky.', ""On their own, any unflavored meat alternative won't have the taste of actual animal flesh, but once food manufacturers have achieved that meaty texture, they can season the faux meat to mimic anything from hot dogs and ribs to steak and calamari."", 'Texture plays a big role in determining whether a product tastes like real meat or not. For example, the satisfyingly stringy texture one gets from pulling apart chicken strips. Fortunately, food scientists have found ways to emulate the fibrous quality in fake meat using soy protein. Soy protein is initially globular, so it must be denatured, or broken down, to make it more fibrous. Soy protein is first exposed to heat, solvent, or acid, before it is reshaped with a food extruder . Extrusion processes are useful as they can form meat analogs with fibrous matrices, which can then be rehydrated into meat like substances . However, this process can sometimes result in a dry product. The rising company Beyond Meat has gone further and found a way to use soy flour, pea flour, carrot fiber, and gluten-free flour to emulate the fibrous quality in their fake meat with a wet extrusion process. The proteins are realigned and then locked in position by crosslinking to get a fibrous chicken imitation that is also moist and juicy .', 'Last but not least, taste is a significant factor in why people eat fake meat. For many people, the flavour and texture of plant-based meats are indistinguishable from their animal-based counterparts. Simply put, these products taste good.']"
If you have no sense of taste can you feel the heat/spiciness from something like a pepper?,"No, if you have no sense of taste, you cannot feel the heat or spiciness from something like a pepper. The heat or spiciness from the pepper is not a taste, but rather a neurological response caused by the pepper's membrane releasing capsaicin, a chemical compound that clamps onto your mouth's neurotransmitters, which regulate temperature[1]. This false alert your brain interprets as a blast of heat, without damaging any tissue or taste buds[1].","['No, not when you ingest the amounts we typically consume in food. In fact, when you eat spicy food, you’re not burning your tongue at all—you’re a victim of a neurological response. When you take a bite out of a chile pepper, the pepper’s membranes release capsaicin, a chemical compound that clamps onto your mouth’s neurotransmitters, which regulate temperature. These are the same receptors that would tell the roof of your mouth, say, that it was being burned from a bite of scorching hot brick-oven pizza, but in the spicy food scenario, the receptors falsely alert you that you’re literally burning your mouth. These receptors exist all over your body, which also explains why you have a burning sensation on your fingers after chopping serrano peppers (or in your eyes if you absentmindedly rub them). But, according to Keith Cadwallader, a professor at the University of Illinois, there’s no damage to any tissue itself: The interaction is simply a signal that our brains interpret as a blast of heat. And it certainly doesn’t damage your taste buds, as the capsaicin doesn’t even interact with them. Spiciness isn’t a taste; it’s simply a pain response.', 'The number of peppers next to a dish indicates a meal’s spiciness. Unlike the five basic tastes—sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami—spicy is something different. Spice provokes an immediate reaction, often triggering pain and numbness. In fact, humans have been using the components of spicy stuff for centuries to treat pain. Despite this, today scientists are still unraveling what spiciness actually is and what distinguishes it from taste. With a better understanding, researchers could find even better ways to use it to treat pain and other disorders.', ""Technically speaking we don't actually taste the spiciness in spicy food. Spiciness is in fact a form of pain sensation! Surprised? To understand why it is a pain sensation we need to know a bit about how we perceive pain."", 'Why do we love to eat peppers? I wrote about this question on The Guardian’s science blog last year. Spiciness, in fact, has nothing to do with sweetness or salt or sourness. Spicy is an abbreviation for pain. The sensation of spiciness is produced when pain receptors are activated in the tongue. Capsaicin is a member of the vanilloid family of molecules, and it binds to a receptor on the tongue. When capsaicin binds to the VR1 receptor, it produces the same sensation as heat, which explains why it burns.', 'So spiciness is basically a combination of the pain and burning sensation that you get when you eat spicy food! The process of how all this happens is called Chemesthesis.']"
"Why does Basic Income Decrease ""Werkgelegenheid"" and is this the same metric as ""Job Opportunities""?","Implementing a substantial basic income has been argued to reduce ""werkgelegenheid"" (employment) in order to improve labour market flexibility, boost low wage employment and part-time work[1]. This is because workers may not find jobs that suit their skills due to the lack of work experience and/or difficulties signaling their skills, which may cause their reservation wages to be higher than wage offers they receive[2]. Additionally, research has found that payroll subsidies for manual workers, such as the Finnish payroll subsidy for older, low-wage workers, can reduce hours of work and hourly earnings[3]. Other studies have also found that increases in the minimum wage reduce employment, but found no evidence of increased employment when the payroll tax subsidy was increased[4]. Finally, there is evidence that the employment effects of wage subsidies persist long after the subsidy expires, as it increases workers' lifetime earnings[4][5]. ""Job opportunities"" is a different metric, which refers to the percentage of people who are actively seeking a job who are able to find one.","['Basic income is a regularly debated topic in various scholarly disciplines (political philosophy, political theory, welfare economics, labour market economics and social policy) and in circles of policy makers, administrators and activists. Since the late 1970s, unemployment is the primary problem for social-economic policy in all welfare states. In Basic Income, Unemployment and Compensatory Justice it is argued that implementing a substantial basic income is the best policy response to deal with unemployment-induced problems such as job insecurity, social exclusion, poverty and lack of compensatory justice on the labour market and to improve labour market flexibility, boost low wage employment and part-time work. Basic Income, Unemployment and Compensatory Justice, with an introductory chapter by Philippe van Parijs, discusses the attractiveness of a substantial basic income to deal with the problem of unemployment, in combination with an ethical perspective of social justice.', 'In summary, at any level of human capital, workers might not find jobs that suit their skills/diplomas because of the lack of work experience and/or difficulties signaling these skills (long-term unemployment can also bring observed skills below their potential6). Their reservation wages are likely to be higher than the wage offers they receive to compensate for their learning needs. In part, this is because lower productivity jobs could pay more. But other factors (not taken into account in our simple model) such as family support or expectations about fair wages for a given set of skills can also increase reservation wages. Workers would then prefer to wait and remain unemployed seeking for better job offers, or eventually settle in lower productivity jobs where there would be less learning7. Clearly, one can argue that rational individuals would understand that they are better off over the long term by taking the higher productivity jobs and accepting the lower wages. They could, for instance, borrow to help support the period of on the job training at low pay and then repay the loan when their salaries increase. But even if individuals had the right foresight, access to credit is often not an option, particularly, among worker with no job history or who have been through long periods of unemployment.', 'Goos and Konings (2007) also used firm data to evaluate the payroll subsidies for manual workers in Belgium, and found significant effects on employment. A careful analysis of the Finnish payroll subsidy for older, low-wage workers by Huttunen et al. (2010) found mixed results: the subsidy had no significant effect on employment or the probability of leaving a job, but produced a 2 percent increase in the hours of work for employees in the industrial sector (but not the service sector) by increasing the probability that a part-time worker would become full-time by 7 percent. At the same time, the subsidy reduced hourly earnings of industrial workers by 2 percent, just offsetting the effect of the increase in hours on earnings.', 'There have been several evaluations of the French system, in which payroll taxes are reduced for low-wage workers; the subsidy is phased out as wages rise. Using household data, Kramarz and Philippon (2001) compared workers affected by changes in the minimum wage or the payroll tax subsidy when those policies changed with workers just above that level. They found that increases in the minimum wage reduced employment, but found no evidence of increased employment when the payroll tax subsidy was increased. Crepon and Desplatz (2002) used firm data to estimate the effects of different levels of the payroll tax on total employment at the firm level. They found that larger subsidies were indeed correlated with faster growth in total employment (in cross-section), but their data did not allow them to distinguish between growth in low-wage jobs and growth in high-wage jobs.', 'Most of these studies do not distinguish between the employment effects while the wage subsidy is being received, as predicted by the static model, and the longer-term employment effects generated by greater work experience and, therefore, higher productivity, as predicted by the dynamic model discussed in the previous section. However, the studies cited earlier, by Orr et al. (1996), Bell et al. (1999), strongly imply that the employment effects of wage subsidies persist long after the subsidy expires. In another study Heckman et al. (2002) posit a model of “learning by doing” in which time spent working increases human capital and contrast it with a model of “on-the-job training”, which entails a tradeoff between working and training and, therefore, forgone earnings. Using changes in earnings induced by changes in the structure of the U.S. Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), they show that under a model of learning by doing, the EITC increases workers’ lifetime earnings, whereas under the formal training model, the EITC actually reduces earnings, once the tradeoff between work and training is taken into account14.']"
Animal cloning,"Animal cloning is a technique for the production of genetically indistinguishable copies of the desired animal[2]. It has been used in a number of different applications, such as producing animals with gene mutations to study diseases, producing livestock like cows and pigs with more milk or meat, and even “resurrecting” beloved pets[1]. Scientists have successfully cloned cattle, swine, sheep, goats, mice, rats, rabbits, cats, mules, horses, and one dog[3]. Animal cloning can help progress current research and fight the battle against diseases, and can also be used to replace a lost pet[4]. However, animal cloning can lead to the reduction of genetic diversity and can be expensive and inefficient in comparison to sexual reproduction[5].","['The cloning of animals has been used in a number of different applications. Animals have been cloned to have gene mutations that help scientists study diseases that develop in the animals. Livestock like cows and pigs have been cloned to produce more milk or meat. Clones can even “resurrect” a beloved pet that has died. In 2001, a cat named CC was the first pet to be created through cloning. Cloning might one day bring back extinct species like the woolly mammoth or giant panda.', 'Animal cloning is a technique for the production of genetically indistinguishable copies of the desired animal. So far, adult animals such as cattle, pigs, rabbits, sheep, and goats have been cloned using nuclear transfer from a somatic cell. The reprogramming of the somatic cell nucleus in developing an early embryo is a major challenge. Earlier, due to its low success rate in growth and development from gestation to adulthood, it was considered an inefficient technique. However, the recent breakthrough of somatic nuclear transfer and human embryonic stem cell (ESC) derivation have shaped a new movement in this field. The use of ESCs as a source of multiple cell types for use in the repair of tissue to improve genetic makeup, to revive endangered and rare species, in the engineering of tissues and to increase the yield of farm animals and their population has gained much attention due to cloning. Owing to its benefits for farmers, animal conservationists, the pharmaceutical industry, and genetic engineering to meet the production demand of the world, in the future animal cloning could become a common technology. This chapter explains the details of the current paradigm in animal cloning with its applications in different field with the risk factors.', 'Cloning is a complex process that lets one exactly copy the genetic, or inherited, traits of an animal (the donor). Livestock species that scientists have successfully cloned are cattle, swine, sheep, and goats. Scientists have also cloned mice, rats, rabbits, cats, mules, horses and one dog. Chickens and other poultry have not been cloned.', 'Animal cloning can help progress current research and fight the battle against current diseases. It can also be used to replace a lost pet.', 'Animal cloning can lead to the reduction of genetic diversity, which compromises the adaptability of species to survive changes in the environment. Animal cloning is also expensive and inefficient in comparison to sexual reproduction.']"
how come we don't yet know the perfect diet for humans?,"We do not yet know the perfect diet for humans because there is likely no single natural diet that is best for human health[2]. Humans can be very healthy on a wide range of diets, and we see a wide range of diets in very healthy populations[3]. This is likely due to the fact that humans evolved to eat a wide variety of diets all over the world, from the Arctic to the tropics, desert, plains, and mountains[5]. Therefore, the perfect diet for humans is likely one that is balanced and comprised of real food.","['In other words, there is no one ideal human diet. Aiello and Leonard say the real hallmark of being human isn’t our taste for meat but our ability to adapt to many habitats—and to be able to combine many different foods to create many healthy diets. Unfortunately the modern Western diet does not appear to be one of them.', 'Nutrition experts have long debated whether there is an optimal diet that humans evolved to eat. But a study published this month adds a twist. It found that there is likely no single natural diet that is best for human health.', 'The findings suggest that there is no one “true” diet for humans, who “can be very healthy on a wide range of diets,” said the lead author of the study, Herman Pontzer, an associate professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke University. “We know that because we see a wide range of diets in these very healthy populations.”', 'It’s beyond strange that so many humans are clueless about how they should feed themselves. Every wild species on the planet knows how to do it; presumably ours did, too, before our oversized brains found new ways to complicate things. Now, we’re the only species that can be baffled about the “right” way to eat.', 'Bear in mind that humans evolved to eat a wide variety of diets, all over the world, from the Arctic to the tropics, desert, plains, mountains, all of which offer wildly different kinds of foods. But none of them “naturally” offer junk food or industrially produced animal products. If you bear that in mind, and eat a balanced diet of real food, you don’t have to worry about much else. It’s really quite simple.']"
"During the Middle Ages, what would happen if a country invaded another, and the invaded country couldn't afford to fight so it surrendered, but the invading country kept on fighting?","If a country invaded another and the invaded country couldn't afford to fight, the invading country would likely still keep on fighting. This was a common occurrence during the Middle Ages, as warfare was constant and power lay with substantial property owners. It was almost impossible for any medieval ruler of substance to avoid fighting for his entire career[1]. Warfare was dictated by the length that an archer could shoot an arrow, and by the strength of the arms that wielded swords and spears[2]. It was also fueled by a desire to protect or capture land and resources[2], and rulers were willing to risk confrontation with their vassals and taxpayers in order to build castles to protect their land[5].","['Historians may cringe, but the popular “castle and knight” image of the High Middle Ages does contain important elements of truth. Certainly, warfare was constant. To denizens of the twenty-first century, the scale of war a thousand years ago appears small, but the share of resources that was consumed by war was enormous. This consumption included not only the expenses of waging war but, almost invariably, the deliberate destruction of economic assets that accompanied invasions, and sometimes retreats as well. Power lay with substantial property owners. In the absence of powerful centralized governments local rulers could and did make war for almost every reason imaginable. To be sure, tradition, chivalry, and (occasionally) law did place some limits on warfare, but it was almost impossible for any medieval ruler of substance to avoid fighting for his entire career.', 'To understand how Western Europeans conducted warfare in the Central Middle Ages, it is important to have a sense of some of the key features of politics and culture in this period. The most essential fact to bear in mind is that the key to Western European society in the Central Middle Ages was land, or, more specifically, the ownership of land. As a result, the interests of landowners often shaped warfare; military activity was invariably conducted by the ruling elite in order to protect their own land, or with the aim to capture new territory from a rival. While there was a degree of development in the technology of weapons and armour over the period, there was no great transformative revolution; throughout these centuries, warfare remained largely dictated by the length that an archer could shoot an arrow, and by the strength of the arms that wielded swords and spears.', 'Take World War I, for instance. Britain and Germany got caught up in an arms race to build more ships, each hoping to cow the other into submission. Instead, both countries became increasingly aggressive. “And then a random event in Yugoslavia triggered a horrible war,” says Sandeep Baliga, a professor of managerial economics and decision sciences at Kellogg.', 'In the period between 1000 and 1300, an era often termed the ‘Central’ or ‘High’ Middle Ages, warfare was one of the defining features of society in Western Europe. The prevalence of martial conflict was a fact of which observers at the time were aware. From around 1000, contemporaries began to formulate a view of society which divided its members into three groups, according to the functions that they performed in society. These three groups – or ‘Orders’, as they were known – consisted of: those who worked, those who prayed, and those who fought. It was the last of these – the warriors – who attracted much attention from contemporary chroniclers and historians.', 'Historiography of medieval warfare has dispelled the notion that commanders and rulers were simpletons. Medieval rulers were keenly aware of their choices and attending costs. Knowing the cost of castles, they continued to build them. Even when short of money, they continued to build them, risking confrontation with vassals and taxpayers over the bill. To leaders of the age, the benefit of permanent walls outweighed the cost.']"
Why does smoking preserve food?,"Smoking food is an effective form of food preservation because it relies on low heat[1][2], which kills microbes[3]. The combination of smoke and salt also helps preserve meat by acting as preservatives[3]. The smoke helps to dry the meat, which is accelerated by the addition of salt[3][5]. Additionally, in the past, smoking was used in combination with other techniques such as salt-curing or drying to further preserve food[5].","['Smoking, as a mode of food preservation, is probably as old as cooking with fire. Heat and smoke infuse a delicate flavor into fish, ham, poultry and meat and can prevent the growth of microbes. While smoking done right is a very effective form of food preservation, care must be taken to avoid contamination and food-borne illness.', 'Smoking food is different from the other food preservation methods because it relies on low heat. Some other methods rely on dry heat, commonly known as frying or grilling. Smoking food for preservation differs from smoking food for immediate eating in that food meant for preservation is placed far away from the heat source, and the food is never dipped in any liquid.', 'According to Livestrong, the process of smoking involves using a combination of smoke and salt to preserve meat. There are a few different reasons why smoking helps preserve meat. The heat kills microbes and chemicals found in smoke act as preservatives. According to Science Direct, these chemicals collect on the surface of the meat and help prevent the development of microorganisms. The smoke also helps dry the meat, a process that is accelerated by the addition of salt.', 'Food smoking is a technique that began thousands of years ago. It is believed that food preservation dates back to when humans invented fire. It is a practice passed down through generations and is still being used in some parts of the world. The older generation primarily smoked food to preserve it, but today it’s a bit different. Food is now being smoked to cook, flavor, or preserve it using smoke from burning wood chips, charcoal briquettes, and wood dust.', 'In the past, smoking was a useful preservation tool, in combination with other techniques, most commonly salt-curing or drying. In some cases, particularly in climates without much hot sunshine, smoking was simply an unavoidable side effect of drying over a fire. For some long-smoked foods, the smoking time also served to dry the food. Drying, curing, or other techniques can render the interior of foods inhospitable to bacterial life, while the smoking gives the vulnerable exterior surfaces an extra layer of protection. For oily fish smoking is especially useful, as its antioxidant properties delay surface fat rancidification. (Interior fat is not as exposed to oxygen, which is what causes rancidity.) Some heavily-salted, long-smoked fish can keep without refrigeration for weeks or months. Such heavily-preserved foods usually require a treatment such as boiling in fresh water to make them palatable before eating.']"
Why do we drink cow's milk instead of human milk?,"We drink cow's milk instead of human milk because cow's milk is more readily available and has a better taste than human milk. Additionally, human milk is intended only for babies and it is considered cruel to take the milk away from calves for whom it is intended[2]. Drinking milk from cows has also been a practice for millennia[3], as cows lactate after having a baby (calf) and can be bottle fed by farmers if the mother is hooked to a milk machine[4]. Finally, drinking cow's milk may provide antibodies against some diseases that people may be exposed to when keeping livestock[5].","[""Plus, notice that we mostly drink milk that comes from animals that like to graze on grass, like cows, goat, and sheep. Humans eat a lot of junk food and other stuff that doesn't make for very good tasting milk."", '“No human should be consuming milk after they’ve been weaned from their mother’s breast,” she wrote. “It is completely unnatural. Cow’s milk is intended only for baby cows—and it’s cruel to take the milk away from the calves for whom it is clearly intended. Need calcium? Milk, which may contribute to osteoporosis and numerous other health issues, is the last place you should be getting it.”', 'Perhaps drinking milk does seem unusual, if you think about it that way! But humans have been consuming milk for millennia — and not just milk from cows, but from sheep, goats, and other animals, too.', 'They lactate after they have a baby (calf) just like humans and other mammals. Calves are usually taken away soon after birth, bottle fed by farmers and the mother is hooked to the milk machine. Fun fact, if you stop breastfeeding/milking the cow often enough, the milk ""dries up."" Yay for biology knowing the law of supply and demand.', ""She speculates that drinking milk might have other advantages besides its nutritional value. People who keep livestock are exposed to their diseases, which can include anthrax and cryptosporidiosis. It may be that drinking cow’s milk provides antibodies against some of these infections. Indeed, milk's protective effect is thought to be one of the benefits of breastfeeding children.""]"
Why are eggs used as an ingredient in every single recipe,"Eggs are used as an ingredient in every single recipe because they are a truly multifunctional ingredient with many roles to play in the bakeshop[3]. They may be used to add structure, flavor, texture or act as a leavening agent[5].

Additionally, egg whites have the capability to gel and are frequently used as a binding agent in many different prepared foods[2].","['Eggs are one of the most important, natural ingredients in baking. Egg-free baking recipes are few and far between, and for good reason – for many products eggs are indispensable. Eggs bind, aerate, leaven, emulsify, thicken, aid in setting, are the base in many recipes and can be used as fillings, toppings, glazes and also for adding flavour and colour to baked goods. No other single ingredient can do so much in baking.

How does cheese get its flavor? What differentiates cheddar cheese from american cheese? Is it ingredients or something in the process of it being made?,"Cheddar cheese is a hard English cheese made from cow's milk that has been coagulated with rennet, while American cheese is a processed cheese made from a blend of two or more ""real"" cheeses, like cheddar and colby, and other ingredients like whey, milk proteins, vitamins, coloring, and emulsifying agents[1][3]. Cheddar cheese has more flavor compared to American cheese, which is artificially processed and less expensive[2]. The ingredients of American cheese include cheddar cheese, whey, water, protein concentrate, milk, sodium citrate, calcium phosphate, milkfat, gelatin, salt, sodium phosphate, lactic acid as a preservative, annatto and paprika extract (color), enzymes, Vitamin A palmitate, and cheese culture, Vitamin D3[4].","['American and cheddar cheeses might look similar, but they are not the same.

Why do trees/coral constantly grow while humans and most other animals stop growing as adults?,"Trees and coral are able to constantly grow while humans and most other animals stop growing as adults because they have what is known as ""indeterminate growth"". This means that they will keep growing until they die, and their growth is not limited by a predetermined life span[3]. Trees, for example, get taller and thicker with age as long as they have access to resources[3]. Corals also grow in winter and summer due to seasonal changes in ocean temperature, pH, availability of nutrients and differences in light irradiance[4]. Lastly, coral reefs are able to grow and maintain their large size due to a mutual exchange between the tiniest ocean animals and plants which has been going on for 25 million years[5].","[""Like other animals and many living things, we humans grow when we're young and then stop growing once we mature. But trees, it turns out, are an exception to this general rule. In fact, scientists have discovered that trees grow faster the older they get."", 'Most humans stop growing when they become a young adult, but what about other animals? Are there animals that never stop growing?', 'Sharks aren\'t the only animal that keeps growing. Lizards, snakes, amphibians, and coral all continue to grow until they die. The scientific name for these creatures is ""indeterminate growers"". The Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine, like many other trees, lives for thousands of years and never stops growing. A 2001 study discovered one that hadn\'t had a significant mutation in its pollen or seeds over 4,700 years. At some point, the trees stop getting taller, but they will continue to thicken at the trunk as long as they have access to resources. Some animals have what\'s called ""Negligible Senescence,"" which means they don\'t seem to age. Evolution didn\'t program a natural limit to their lives. Animals discovered to have this are tortoises, sharks, turtles, whales, and some types of fish. A Rougheye Rockfish was caught and determined to be 205 years old. Lobsters will continue growing until preyed upon or killed: A 20 pound (9 kg) lobster was discovered and believed to be 140 years old!', 'As growth can be influenced by environmental conditions, understanding the mechanisms and rates of growth can give precious insights on the effects of climate change and anthropogenic disturbances. Annual growth rings of several species of corals act as climatic archive in a similar manner as it happens in trees. Corals grow in winter and summer, but the density of the calcium carbonate depositions in the coral skeleton is different due to seasonal changes in ocean temperature, pH, availability of nutrients, and differences in light irradiance.', 'More than merely a clever collaboration that has endured between some of the tiniest ocean animals and plants for some 25 million years, this mutual exchange is the reason why coral reefs are the largest structures of biological origin on Earth, and rival old-growth forests in the longevity of their ecological communities.']"
Why can't we clone endangered species to rejuvenate their population?,"Cloning endangered species to rejuvenate their population is a controversial topic. While some scientists argue that cloning could be the best way to preserve endangered species and bring extinct species back[1], many others oppose cloning, saying that humans should rather stop biodiversity loss by tackling the issues that cause this in the first place[1]. Additionally, researchers believe that resilient habitats have not been developed to aid a sustainable population of endangered or extinct species[3]. Also, bringing a species back into an environment that is completely different to the one they once thrived in will unlikely contribute to a sustainable community, and it is not certain that cloned animals would not die of the same pressures or be able to mimic learned behaviours of the past[4]. Lastly, even if cloning could help revive ancient tundra grassland and mitigate the release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere[5], it might not be the best solution in all cases.","['The IUCN is predicting that by the end of the current century, nearly all critically endangered species and 67% of endangered animal species in the world could be lost forever. Some scientists say that cloning could be the best way we have to preserve endangered species and will provide humans with the means to bring extinct species back. However, many oppose cloning, saying that humans should rather stop biodiversity loss by tackling the issues that cause this in the first place. We present the main advantages and disadvantages of this revolutionary technique to answer the question of whether or now we should clone endangered species.', '""Advanced reproductive technologies, including cloning, can save species by allowing us to restore genetic diversity that would have otherwise been lost to time,” says Ryan Phelan, executive director of Revive & Restore.', 'Cloning has perhaps not been as widely accepted because researchers believe that resilient habitats have not been developed to aid a sustainable population of endangered or extinct species. Given that humans are having such a catastrophic influence on species decline through key drivers of extinction like poaching, pollution, and habitat destruction, some argue that simply creating more animals is not the solution.', 'Bringing a species back into an environment that is completely different to the one they once thrived in will unlikely contribute to a sustainable community. And even if the habitat was suitable, how can we be sure that cloned animals would not die of the same pressures, or be able to mimic learned behaviours of the past?', 'Cloning can also be used to re-introduce extinct species into an ecosystem that would greatly benefit from their existence. For example, a group of Russian scientists are trying to recreate an Ice Age biome named Pleistocene Park to combat climate change. One of the scientists involved in the project – Sergey Zimov – has reported that bringing back woolly mammoths could help revive ancient tundra grassland, therefore mitigating the release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.']"
"If my son is highly allergic to eggs, why is he not allergic to chicken?","It is possible for someone to be highly allergic to eggs but not to chicken. An egg allergy occurs when the immune system mistakenly identifies one or more of the proteins in egg as harmful and mounts an attack, releasing chemicals that cause an allergic reaction[5]. Egg contains several proteins in the yolk and white, and kids may only be allergic to certain ones[5]. Additionally, a genuine poultry meat allergy caused by sensitization to meat allergens is not linked to an egg allergy, so it must be treated as a separate condition[4]. As such, it is possible for someone to be allergic to certain proteins found in eggs, but not to chicken[2].","['Eggs are a common cause of allergic reactions in infants and children, requiring egg allergy treatment and testing to minimize health risks. With a growing awareness of cross-reactivity between egg yolk and bird allergens, many parents question if eating chicken might lead to a reaction. For Atlanta parents concerned about links between egg allergies and eating chicken, here’s what you need to know.', 'Some children who are allergic to chicken eggs are allergic to other bird eggs, such as duck, goose and quail, and a smaller number are also allergic to chicken meat. If your child is allergic to egg, watch them closely when they consume these foods and be ready for a reaction. In addition to foods, egg can also be found in craft materials, such as paints, and hair products.', 'Egg is one of the most common food allergies in childhood, affecting about two percent of kids and typically showing up the first time they knowingly eat it. However, to become allergic to egg, a child must first be exposed to it in some way, by unknowingly eating trace amounts or coming in contact through broken skin (such as eczema). It’s extremely rare for a breastfed baby to be exposed to enough protein in their mother’s milk to have an allergic reaction.', 'Fortunately, both bird-egg syndrome and chicken allergies are rare. A genuine poultry meat allergy caused by sensitization to meat allergens is actually not linked to an egg allergy, so it must be treated as a separate condition. In the case of cross-reactive sensitization, incidences of allergic reactions are uncommon, particularly among children.', 'An egg allergy occurs when the immune system mistakenly identifies one or more of the proteins in egg as harmful and mounts an attack, releasing chemicals that cause an allergic reaction. Egg contains several proteins in the yoke and white, and kids may only be allergic to certain ones. “The most allergenic part of the egg is the white, and it causes more serious symptoms,” says Maria Triassi Asper, an allergist at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.']"
how does cloning animals work?,"Cloning animals works by replicating the genetic traits of an animal (the donor) in a process called nuclear transfer. The nucleus from the donor animal is removed and injected into an enucleated egg cell. The egg cell is then stimulated to divide and form an embryo, which is implanted into a surrogate mother. This embryo develops into an animal that is an exact copy of the donor animal. Cloning is legal in the European Union, though researchers must have their work approved by the Home Office before they can begin[4]. The low efficiency of cloning means that a lot of healthy cells and embryos are needed for successful cloning and finding enough cells from an endangered or extinct species as well as a suitable source of recipient egg cells and surrogate mothers poses a considerable challenge[5].","['Cloning is a complex process that lets one exactly copy the genetic, or inherited, traits of an animal (the donor). Livestock species that scientists have successfully cloned are cattle, swine, sheep, and goats. Scientists have also cloned mice, rats, rabbits, cats, mules, horses and one dog. Chickens and other poultry have not been cloned.', 'Cloning of livestock [ 1] is a means of replicating an existing favorable combination of traits, such as efficient growth and high milk production, without the genetic “lottery” and mixing that occur in sexual reproduction. It allows an animal with a particular genetic modification, such as the ability to produce a pharmaceutical in milk, to be replicated more rapidly than does natural mating [ 7; 8]. Moreover, a genetic modification can be made more easily in cultured cells than in an intact animal, and the modified cell nucleus can be transferred to an enucleated egg to make a clone of the required type. Mammals used in scientific experiments, such as mice, are cloned as part of research aimed at increasing our understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms.', 'It is possible that cloning could be used to produce animals from species that are either endangered or extinct, but there are several practical problems which would first have to be solved.', 'Animal cloning for the purposes of scientific research is legal in the European Union, which includes the UK. Like all experiments which involve the use of animals, researchers who want to make cloned animals must have their work approved by the Home Office before they can begin.', 'The low efficiency of cloning means that a lot of healthy cells and embryos would be needed to be sure of success. Finding enough cells from an endangered or extinct species as well as a suitable source of recipient egg cells and surrogate mothers poses a considerable challenge. For example, if you wanted to bring dinosaurs back to life, which animal would you use to give birth to the first clones? Another issue is that cells and embryos from different species require very specific conditions to be successfully grown in the lab, if they can be grown at all. Working out what these conditions are can take a lot of time and research – it took four years of further work after Dolly’s birth for pigs to be successfully cloned.']"
how do small caves get explored ?,"Small caves can be explored by a variety of methods. One old technique used was to yell into a hole and listen for an echo, which could help determine the size of the cave[1]. Additionally, cave explorers may use flashlights, torches made from knots of pine tree branches, or high-tech equipment like drills to create an entrance. A basic understanding of geology can also help to locate and explore caves[4]. Finally, cavers may need to carry large packs in order to haul gear and food for long expeditions[5].","['One old technique used by hill people in the United States to find caves worth exploring was to yell into a hole and listen for an echo. On finding a hole, the size of which did not matter, the would-be cave explorer would yell into the opening and listen for an echo. If there was none, the hole was just a hole. If there was an echo, the size of the cave could be determined by the length and strength of the echoes. This method is simple, cheap, and effective. The explorer could then enlarge the hole to make an entrance. Meriwether Lewis, of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, used the yelling technique to find caves in Kentucky when he was a boy. Since caves were dark, and flashlights had not been invented, Lewis, and other explorers, made torches out of knots of pine tree branches. Such torches burned a long time and cast a bright light.', ""I've been watching some YouTube videos about people going into caves which they only just fit in and where it is impossible to turn around. Now how do those caves get explored ? Is there someone who just goes in as first or which tools to they use to know they won't get stuck or get to a dead end."", 'Most unexplored caves are entranceless or have closed entrances. For most people, exploring entranceless caves is not an option, because you need to create an entrance. This includes drilling and high-tech equipment.', 'To successfully find caves, a basic understanding of (your local) geology helps – a lot. If you know how caves are formed (in general and in your local area specifically), you can spot signals more easily, and you can better predict the layout of a possible cave. This helps you to not only locate them but also explore them.', ""Reaching the ends of the Earth underground is never easy in large cave systems. In Jewel and Lechuguilla Caves, cavers may need to camp for several days underground. Such expeditions require big packs to haul gear and food to support the crew. But the cave passages themselves are often tiny requiring very dense packing, very tough packs, and tenacious cavers to get the necessary gear through and to camp. Jewel Cave is particularly known for its tiny holes that lead to miles of large cave passages. The cavers have known where to go by following the airflow through these small tunnels and tubes. One section of long crawls is called the Miseries, while a section of even smaller holes is called the Mini-Miseries. Lechuguilla Cave has many roped vertical drops, that make for extra challenges and hard work. While on rope cavers “tether” or hang their large bags below themselves. Worn, the weight of the packs throws off ones' balance causing problems on rope.""]"
Neither Cheddar Cheese or Butter is naturally Yellow. (In fact they're both white.) Why and when did they start adding food dye?,"Cheesemakers began adding food dye to Cheddar Cheese and Butter in order to make them look more appealing and to make people think they were getting authentic cheddar cheese, as the more yellow the color of the cheese, the higher the price. This practice of adding color to cheddar cheese dates back to when cheesemakers in England skimmed the butterfat from milk to make butter[2][5]. Cheesemakers added dye to white, low-fat milk that was left behind after the butterfat was skimmed off in order to recreate the yellowish-orange hue of English cheddar, which was a mark of full-flavor and high quality[3]. There is also a theory that dairy farmers in Wisconsin added dye to differentiate their cheddar from imported New England cheddar and to make orange cheddar Wisconsin’s claim to fame and ultimately sell more cheese[4]. Elizabeth Chubbuck of Murray’s Cheese in New York also mentioned that cheesemakers added dye to recreate butterfat’s golden color[5].","[""Unfortunately, it wasn't long before sneaky cheese makers realized that by adding a bit of dye to their white cheeses, they could trick people into thinking they were getting authentic cheddar cheese.

This milk was then turned into cheese, albeit very white cheese. Knowing that the yellowish orange hue of English cheddar was a mark of full-flavor and high quality, they dyed their low-fat cheese in an attempt to sell more.', 'There’s another more local theory similar to this. New England cheesemakers have always preferred to make white cheddar. There’s still a disdain for brightly colored cheeses there today. So when Wisconsin was first settled and local cheesemakers began to make cheddar, they decided to dye it to differentiate it from imported New England cheddar. This was also a marketing tactic to make orange cheddar Wisconsin’s claim to fame and ultimately sell more cheese.', 'Elizabeth Chubbuck, of Murray’s Cheese in New York, said adding color comes from the time when cheesemakers in England took the butterfat from milk to make butter. The leftover milk was whiter. So, she said, cheesemakers added substances to recreate butterfat’s golden color.']"
How is the blood from meat removed before it goes on sale?,"The blood from meat is removed before it goes on sale by not running or exciting the animal prior to slaughter, trimming any soiled, bruised or bloody pieces of meat, washing the carcass with cold water to remove any remaining blood and dirt, and pumping the forelegs up and down a few times to aid in draining blood from the forequarters[3]. Additionally, letting the steak stand for about five minutes after cooking will allow the juices to be redistributed and reabsorbed throughout the meat, resulting in less ‘blood’ on the plate[4]. The remaining liquid is only water mixed with myoglobin, which when exposed to air, turns red and looks like blood, but is actually not[5].","['Of course, nobody could blame you for making this mistake – it’s only natural that you would assume the pinkish-red liquid oozing out of the meat in front of you would be blood. If the sight of blood makes you squeamish, this can be off-putting, but the truth is that practically all of the blood is taken out of meat during processing, long before it gets to your plate.', ""Don't run or excite the animal prior to slaughter because this may cause poor bleeding and give the carcass a bloody appearance."", 'Trim any soiled, bruised or bloody pieces of meat.

Why do raptors put up with harassment from small territorial birds?,"Mobbing is a behavior exhibited by smaller birds to drive away birds they perceive as dangerous, such as raptors. This is usually done in an attempt to defend themselves, their breeding territory, and any nest with eggs or chicks[2]. It is also possible that smaller birds may defend a non-breeding home range as an effort to protect themselves, as well as their food source[2]. Additionally, some photographers have been known to engage in passive-aggressive behavior, such as positioning themselves for a shot in a way that will cause the bird to flush[3]. Other unethical activities, such as baiting or relentlessly pursuing birds for a shot, are also known to occur.","[""I asked several bird photographers what actions they considered harassment of raptors. I asked only of raptors since the HWI blog deals almost exclusively with raptors, however, many of their responses pertains to bird photography in general. It seems almost all agree on certain aspects of harassment, but opinions always vary on any subject, so I'd love to hear comments from anyone! This post was written now because bird photographers are especially out and about in winter, and ethical discussions tend to get brought up during this period. My only hope regarding this post is that some will think twice before taking actions that most consider disturbance.

Rude discussions are never effective!"", 'Many species will swoop and chase flying or perched birds larger than themselves, sometimes even striking them. Birds as small as sparrows, along with larger birds such as crows and ravens, may actively mob raptors. At times, even raptors may exhibit this behavior, as in the case of the Peregrine Falcon in the photo above. The attacking bird typically does this in an attempt to drive away birds, and sometimes mammals, that they perceive as dangerous. Mobbing can happen any time of the year, but is especially common in the spring and early summer – the breeding season. The “mobbing” birds will be actively defending themselves, their breeding territory, and any nest with eggs or chicks. At times, however, birds may even defend a non-breeding home range. This may be an effort to protect themselves, as well as their food source.', ""Baiting birds absolutely unethical. I've taken subversive steps to disrupt baiting by a well-known local falconer and seasonal bird photographers.

For example, at Farmington Bay, UT there's a tree at the bottom of the hill that raptors use. 9 out of 10 times birds will remain perched and allow close approach until another vehicle flushes it. If I know the bird will flush and leveraged the other person's bad behavior to my advantage, is that harassment? I believe it is. I'm glad wildlife photography ethics is an ongoing topic.

The answer, as is usually the case when animal behavior and ecology are involved, is complex. Some explanations seem relatively straightforward whereas others are more speculative.', 'While I find baiting of raptors for photos a near criminal activity and the use of owl decoys a controversial topic, it should be mentioned that owl decoys were used at migration sites long before photographing raptors became popular. Baiting birds, by many (not me) is considered no different than feeding them and that is the argument of those indifferent to it. There is one activity unique to photographers that is harassment in the true sense of the word. That is the relentless pursuit of forcing a bird to leave its perch for the sole purpose of the photographer to get their ""shot of a lifetime!""

Additionally, many animals breed and give birth at different times of year based on the availability of food and other environmental factors, which would make it difficult to breed animals specifically for certain parts. Furthermore, the importation of endangered species is heavily regulated and often difficult to challenge in court[3]. Lastly, most animals that are used for their parts or meat are captured or killed in the wild, which is not sustainable as it can lead to the depletion of the species[5].","['The zoo’s justification for such actions also seems to be their argument; they are more concerned with saving the entire species as a whole, rather than individual zoo animals.

"How do they know which eggs don't have baby chicks in them, when they take eggs to sell??","When eggs are taken to sell, they are inspected to ensure that there is no developing embryo inside the shell[2]. All eggs sold for consumption must be refrigerated, which halts any growth inside the shell. Also, the interior of the egg is inspected by shining a bright light through the shell (called candling), which highlights any irregularities, such as a developing chick[2]. Since nearly all eggs sold commercially are produced by hens that have not mated[3][4], there is no danger of eating a developing embryo[2]. Chick hatcheries breed either egg-laying hens or meat birds, and the eggs are developed in industrial incubators[5]. Once hatched, the newborn chicks pass down a production line to be sexed and sorted, and all male chicks are separated from the healthy female chicks and then killed[5].","['The great majority of eggs, whether from ducks or chickens, will not be fertilised. “You are not going to open a box of eggs, crack them and a chick will fall out,” says Diacono, reassuringly. Commercial egg producers kill off male chicks at birth – a subject they prefer not to talk about – to try to ensure their flocks are female-only. The odd rogue male may, however, get through, which is what appears to have happened in this case.

Eggs with irregularities never make it to retail and are destroyed (except for that one time).', 'The average consumer buying a carton of chicken eggs at the store or farmers market can’t tell the difference between a fertilized egg and an unfertilized egg from outside the shell. Chances are you’ve never eaten a fertilized egg, because nearly all eggs sold commercially are produced by hens that have not mated, says Lauren Cobey, media representative for the American Egg Board.', 'During their exploration of chicken embryology, youth learn that for a chicken to develop from an egg it must be fertilized.

LD50 values and its relation to humans.,"LD50 (Lethal Dose 50%) is a measure of toxicity used to indicate the lethal dose of a substance, which is the amount of that substance that is required to kill 50% of the test population. Typical units for LD50 values are milligrams or grams of material per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg or g/kg). In general, if the immediate toxicity is similar in all of the different animals tested, the degree of immediate toxicity will probably be similar for humans[2]. The LD50 is usually expressed as the mass of substance administered per unit mass of test subject, typically as milligrams of substance per kilogram of body mass, sometimes also stated as nanograms (suitable for botulinum), micrograms, or grams (suitable for paracetamol) per kilogram[4]. Researchers can do the test with any animal species but they use rats or mice most often[5]. However, LD50 values can be unreliable and results may vary greatly between testing facilities due to factors such as the genetic characteristics of the sample population, animal species tested, environmental factors and mode of administration[3].","['Typical units for LD50 values are milligrams or grams of material per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg or g/kg, recall that 1 kg = 2.2 pounds).', 'In general, if the immediate toxicity is similar in all of the different animals tested, the degree of immediate toxicity will probably be similar for humans. When the LD50 values are different for various animal species, one has to make approximations and assumptions when estimating the probable lethal dose for man. Tables 1 and 2 have a column for estimated lethal doses in man. Special calculations are used when translating animal LD50 values to possible lethal dose values for humans. Safety factors of 10,000 or 1000 are usually included in such calculations to allow for the variability between individuals and how they react to a chemical, and for the uncertainties of experiment test results.', 'As a measure of toxicity, LD50 is somewhat unreliable and results may vary greatly between testing facilities due to factors such as the genetic characteristics of the sample population, animal species tested, environmental factors and mode of administration.', 'The LD50 is usually expressed as the mass of substance administered per unit mass of test subject, typically as milligrams of substance per kilogram of body mass, sometimes also stated as nanograms (suitable for botulinum), micrograms, or grams (suitable for paracetamol) per kilogram. Stating it this way allows the relative toxicity of different substances to be compared, and normalizes for the variation in the size of the animals exposed (although toxicity does not always scale simply with body mass). For substances in the environment, such as poisonous vapors or substances in water that are toxic to fish, the concentration in the environment (per cubic metre or per litre) is used, giving a value of LC50. But in this case, the exposure time is important (see below).', 'The LD50 value obtained at the end of the experiment is identified as the LD50 (oral), LD50 (skin), LD50 (i.v.), etc., as appropriate. Researchers can do the test with any animal species but they use rats or mice most often. Other species include dogs, hamsters, cats, guinea-pigs, rabbits, and monkeys. In each case, the LD50 value is expressed as the weight of chemical administered per kilogram body weight of the animal and it states the test animal used and route of exposure or administration; e.g., LD50 (oral, rat) - 5 mg/kg, LD50 (skin, rabbit) - 5 g/kg. So, the example ""LD50 (oral, rat) 5 mg/kg"" means that 5 milligrams of that chemical for every 1 kilogram body weight of the rat, when administered in one dose by mouth, causes the death of 50% of the test group.']"
Why do companies 'throw away' good food as opposed to give it away for free?,"Companies sometimes 'throw away' good food as opposed to giving it away for free because of confusing date labels on food packaging, as well as consumer habits and attitudes which lead to food being thrown away in people's homes. In some countries, laws have been introduced to prevent grocery stores from throwing away leftover food, instead mandating that it be redistributed to charities[4]. Companies also aim to use every bit of raw materials they have, and look for ways to use up their products instead of throwing them away, such as donating them to charities[5].","['Around the country, apps that connect customers to businesses with leftover food have begun to spread. The concept is simple: Restaurants and grocery stores throw away huge amounts of food every day. Rather than trash it, apps like Too Good To Go and Flashfood help businesses sell it at a reduced price. They claim that the businesses and buyers are helping the environment because the food would otherwise become food waste, a big contributor to climate change.', ""Good food can get thrown away simply because date labels on food packaging are confusing. We’re working with others to make it easier for consumers to understand if their food is safe and stop food being unnecessarily thrown away. We want to see harmonised regulations that set 'use-by' dates for foods with shorter durability on the basis of safety, and 'best-before' dates for foods with longer durability on the grounds of quality."", 'No one feels good about throwing food away. Yet around 60% of food waste happens in people’s homes – so it’s clear we can do more to support consumers to change habits and attitudes.', 'He added that in France, laws introduced in 2016 banned grocery stores from throwing away leftover food. As a result, unsold food is now redistributed to charities there.', 'We also aim to use every bit of raw materials, so none are wasted. Sometimes an issue with a product label means we can’t sell it, but we look for ways to use up the product instead of throwing it away. For example, in Brazil, our brands including Hellmann’s and Mãe Terra partnered with social media influencers to donate products to charities in need of food, which were chosen by social media users. This helped divert more than 100 tonnes of edible food products from being wasted to those in need.']"
Working class opposition to unions.,"Working class opposition to unions can stem from a variety of sources, including economic gains that come from remaining outside the union, moral opposition to unionism, and spite against the union[2]. Despite this opposition, support for labor unions is at an all-time high, with 68% approval in the US[3]. Liberal Democrats are more likely than conservative and moderate Democrats to think that the decline in the percentage of workers represented by unions has been bad for working people[4]. Employers can try to undermine solidarity of collective contention at the point of attack by dividing the class of potential contenders, which often results in ruthless and bloody contests for a substantial stretch of US history[5].","['For workers to have a chance at successfully persuading their employers to capitulate as a result of their withdrawal of collective labor power, they need to make the effort as fully collective as possible by building awareness, understanding, trust, commitment, all shaped into a working-class culture prepared for opposition. In the face of multiple competing alliances, cleavages, dominant ideological opposition, workers develop rudiments of an oppositional subculture as one side of the class formative process, intraclass solidarity manifested in a culture of mutuality and material organization. This culture of solidarity grew out of the conditions of labor as it was being shaped by industrial capital. The materialization of this class mutuality in the Gilded Age consisted of unions, Knights of Labor assemblies, clubs, cooperatives, labor newspapers, singing societies, fraternal organizations, political organizations, and workers’ militia (Oestreicher Reference Oestreicher1989: 60–67).', 'Unlike the anti-unionism that runs through the ranks of employers, worker anti-unionism describes the workers who are opposed to or who work against unionization. Anti-union actions can be seen throughout the United States from the early industrial age forward and include anything from refusing to join the union or follow union orders, to fighting against the union, such as with strikebreaking. Workers’ reasons for acting against the union, however, are far more complex, including the economic gains that come from remaining outside the union, moral opposition to unionism, and spite against the union. The variations between workers’ reasons for rejecting the union, then, provide insight into how workers define their place in society as well as their relationship with the union.', 'An August 2021 poll conducted by Gallup found support for labor unions at their highest point in the US since 1965, with 68% support in the US. Labor unions were the only institution for whom Americans’ approval did not decline over the past year, in a June poll on confidence for 16 major US institutions.', 'While large majorities of all Democrats say the decline in the percentage of workers represented by unions has been bad for working people, liberal Democrats (84%) are more likely to say this than conservative and moderate Democrats (69%).', 'The key to undermining solidarity of collective contention at the point of attack is an old one; divide the class of potential contenders—here wage workers in strike action—to win the battle. Some employers were in a better position than others to make this labor substitution; conditions that limited this exchange freedom for employers made them more vulnerable to workers’ strikes (see Kimeldorf Reference Kimeldorf2013; Martin et al. Reference Martin, Dixon and Nau2017). The fact that such orchestrated contests of commodified labor centered quite literally on terms of physical survival for the working class made these events often ruthless and bloody contests for a substantial stretch of US history (Lipold and Isaac Reference Lipold and Isaac2009).']"
How do you remove the fat and calories from whole milk?,"To remove the fat and calories from whole milk, it needs to be skimmed. This can be done by letting the milk sit for several hours with the lid on and then using a spoon to skim the layer of cream off the top[1][2]. All the cream needs to be removed[1][2][3], and the milk should be fortified with vitamins A and D to ensure that important nutrients are not lost[5]. Low-fat or skim milk is generally preferred to whole milk, as liquid calories are not as filling as equivalent calories from solid foods and reducing calorie intake is important for overall health[4].","['Fat is of different density than water and when left alone has a tendency to float to its top. So if you take whole milk that comes right out of a cow and let it sit for a while, the fat in it, which is the source of almost all of its calories, comes to the top and can be skimmed off. This is why they call milk with the fat removed ""skim milk"" - it\'s literally been skimmed.', ""To skim fat from whole milk, keep in mind that you'll only be able to skim the fat if the milk hasn't been homogenized.

In fact, Nelms et al. note that young children and the elderly may benefit from the higher fat content in whole -- or even 2 percent -- milk. Removing fat from milk may result in the loss of certain fat-soluble nutrients, including vitamins A and D, report Nelms et al. Be sure to read labels carefully to ensure the skim milk in your grocery store is fortified with these important vitamins.']"
If Bluefin Tuna are Going Extinct Why Can't we Just Breed Them Like Salmon?,"While some researchers are attempting to breed bluefin tuna, the process is expensive and has not been proven to be successful. Additionally, if bluefin tuna were to go extinct, it would likely result in overpopulation of other sea creatures such as squid, crustaceans, mackerel, herring, and other kinds of fish[2], which could lead to a disruption in the natural ecosystem. Furthermore, if bluefin tuna were to be farmed on the same scale as salmon, it could lead to the depletion of the food source for the remaining wild fish[4]. Finally, even if bluefin tuna were to be successfully bred and farmed, it could still have its own environmental issues, such as drawing from the ocean until small fish become endangered[5].","['Some scientists are skeptical about the prospects of breeding bluefin, and environmentalists say the breeding efforts are a costly distraction. “That’s a really expensive way of not solving a problem — which is the overfishing of bluefin tuna,” said Tom Grasso, the director of marine conservation policy at WWF, a conservation organization that currently supports a worldwide ban on all Atlantic bluefin fishing and encourages people to eat other kinds of tuna instead.', 'These populations include squid, crustaceans, mackerel, herring, and other kinds of fish. If bluefin tuna were to go extinct, it is likely that these sea creatures would quickly become overpopulated.', 'Key tuna farming research has also been taking place in Japan, the leader of bluefin breeding for about 30 years. However, the long wait for sexual maturity has made the endeavor financially impractical. Scientists at Kinki University, for instance, allowed the Pacific variety of bluefin to spawn naturally in pens. These captive breeders produced fish that could make eggs of their own, but not consistently.', 'As fisheries decline globally, more and more countries are trying to replace their wild fish with farmed ones. Today 30 million tons of small forage fish are removed from the oceans yearly, with the majority of it going to feed farmed fish. If we end up farming bluefin on the same scale as we now farm salmon, the tuna, with its poor feed-conversion rate, may end up taking the food of the remaining wild fish that we haven’t yet got around to catching.', 'Of course, farmed bluefin has its own environmental issues. Being at the top of the food chain, tuna need to eat lots of other, smaller fish. In a farm system, these lower-food-chain fish still come from the wild. While a natural ecosystem balances out the number of predators and feeder fish, farms and ranches can simply keep drawing from the ocean until small fish become endangered too. Farming bluefin tuna, while a valiant effort, may simply not provide enough benefit to the consumer or the environment to be worth it. But research will continue, because keeping bluefin around is a matter of maintaining a culture as much it is about maintaining ethical ground.']"
Why do governments or businesses commit to policy/plastic waste changes 2-5+ years in the future? Why not sooner?,"Governments and businesses commit to policy/plastic waste changes 2-5+ years in the future in order to create the conditions for sustainable consumption, remove barriers to investments in research and the new circular economy, and to build upon the momentum to safeguard our planet's future. Additionally, energy production from plastic waste has been a preferred option compared to landfills due to potential leakage into the environment, however, incineration of plastic waste generates large emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants, which contradict Sustainable Development Goals 13 and 15[5]. Therefore, long-term policies are needed in order to shift away from single-use plastics and to mobilise private finance for the chemical recycling of plastic waste to fuels through pyrolysis, which has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants to a large extent[5].","['- A shift to a circular economy can reduce the volume of plastics entering oceans by over 80 per cent by 2040; reduce virgin plastic production by 55 per cent; save governments US$70 billion by 2040; reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 per cent; and create 700,000 additional jobs – mainly in the global south.', 'Governments need to enact policies to create the conditions for sustainable consumption, to reduce the barriers for individuals to make sustainable choices.

"What is it in most animals that makes them ""shut down"" with a blindfold on?","Most animals will shut down when a blindfold is put on them because they are unable to rely on their sense of sight to interpret their environment. Instead, they must rely on their other senses, such as hearing, touch, and smell, to figure out what is going on around them. For example, in the game Blindfold Doggy, the object of the game is to care for your dog, and the better you care for your dog, the more points you'll score. When your dog isn't trained, it will enter a run away loop[2], and if you play with it once and go to play again, it will say your dog needs to sleep[3].

How do the water intake on this nuclear plant work? And how this guy managed to go from the inlet to the outlet without a scratch?,"Nuclear power plants work by using water to extract and process uranium fuel, produce electricity, and control wastes and risks[5]. Cooling systems are designed so that if pipes begin to leak, local water runs into the plant rather than radioactive water leaking out[2]. About 40 percent of nuclear reactors in the US use recirculating cooling systems, while 46 percent use once-through cooling[3]. An emergency supply of water is also required to cool the plant in case of an accident[4]. It is unclear how the person managed to go from the inlet to the outlet without a scratch.","['When nuclear plants draw water from natural water sources, fish and other wildlife get caught in the cooling system water intake structures. While this is an issue for all power plants with water-cooled systems, a study completed in 2005 in Southern California indicates that the problem is more acute for nuclear facilities. The study investigated impacts from 11 coastal power plants and estimated that in 2003, a single nuclear plant killed close to 3.5 million fish--32 times more than the combined impact of all of the other plants in the study.', 'The main difference between nuclear reactor types is that pressurized water reactors keep the boiler water separate from the reactor, which allows this water to be kept free of radioactivity. Nuclear cooling systems are designed so that if pipes begin to leak, local water runs into the plant rather than radioactive water leaking out. Radioactively contaminated water can then be discharged to local water sources after treatment in “liquid radwaste systems” if radioactive discharges are below federal limits.', 'Like other thermoelectric power plants, nuclear reactors use once-through or recirculating cooling systems. About 40 percent of nuclear reactors in the US use recirculating cooling systems; 46 percent, once-through cooling.  BWRs and PWRs use comparable amounts of water to produce a unit of electricity. Nuclear plants as a whole withdraw and consume more water per unit of electricity produced than coal plants using similar cooling technologies because nuclear plants operate at a lower temperature and lower turbine efficiency, and do not lose heat via smokestacks.', 'In the event of a serious accident, such as an overheated reactor, a nuclear power plant is required by federal regulation to have an emergency supply of water that can continue to cool the plant for at least 30 days. These water sources, called Ultimate Heat Sinks (UHS), are used to cool the reactor, which will continue to produce heat long after it is turned off. During an accident, a UHS may need to supply 10,000 to 30,000 gallons of water per minute for emergency cooling. A UHS can be the same water source used for power plant cooling (lake, river, or ocean) or it can be a separate, dedicated water supply.', 'Nuclear power plants generate almost one fifth of the electricity produced in the United States.

"Why are we so reluctant to kill animals nowadays when, in the past, our society used hunt all the time and feel no remorse?","There are several reasons why we are now more reluctant to kill animals than in the past. One reason is that hunting animals can create an imbalance in the environment, leading to extinction of certain species[1]. Killing animals for sport is also seen as cruel, as animals have a nervous system that allows them to feel pain[1][2]. Furthermore, the act of hunting can signal a disregard for human empathy[3], and today's human-dominated world means that any death of a wild animal is a direct result of a human decision[4]. Finally, Americans' over-consumption of animals and lax animal protection laws are largely to blame for the suffering of billions of animals needlessly each year[5], which has led to greater awareness and empathy for animals in society.[1]","['According to me, animals shouldn’t be hunted and used for selfish needs of man. Hunting of animals should be banned as it creates an imbalance in environment. Example: Extinction in the tiger species. Animals have done nothing to deserve this but still they get killed for no reason. While animals are been hunted they also feel pain, as humans have a nervous system which allows them to feel pain. In today’s day, man has being self centered and greedy. The day is not far when man will realize the ill-effects of hunting animals. Animals are been hunted for thrill but why don’t he understand that a balance in the environment should be maintained for his benefit. Man is the creator of crisis, happening recently in the environment. So I feel that hunting is dangerous for the Environment.', 'According to me, animal hunting should be banned. It is cruel and I oppose the ignorant and barbaric slaughter of such innocent animals. I cannot stand the thought of killing animals for thrill as it gives pain to the animals just like humans have a nervous system which allows them to feel pain. Also, this causes extinction to the species and it gets declining which creates a imbalance in the environment. E.g.: Cheetah’s face high mortality rates due to inbreeding issues. Hunting is the form of legal mass murder. Now, who is the culprit of this imbalance in environment?', 'Why? Because there is abundant and compelling evidence from many corridors of social science that draws a causal link between animal abuse and murder and corresponding disregard for human empathy. To kill a lion, possibly only for ego-driven pleasure and bravado, is quite telling. It signals the possibility (and, more likely, the probability) that the individual who demonstrates a blatant indifference to the pain of an animal lacks the capacity to regard human suffering, even that which he may be the cause of. Rather than killing the lion because he had the resources and inclination to do so, his efforts could have been better spent changing the lives of those for whom dental care is woefully lacking!', ""In today's human dominated world the cause of death among wild animals is a direct result of either a conscious or unconscious human decision. How much the animals suffers is determined directly by that decision and on one can escape their responsibility in that choice. Unlike the non-hunter, the hunter - and especially the bowhunter - has chosen to come into direct, close contact with, and appreciation for, his prey and to make his decision consciously on the spot with only his own ethics and conscience to guide him."", 'After all, Americans cause the deaths of far more animals than anyone else on the planet, thanks to our hyper-consumerist society. We love to eat meat; we want to believe our products are safe (even though product testing and even medical experimentation do not guarantee this); we buy, breed, and sell animals without a thought to their future; and a minority of us even kill animals for sport. Expressing anger over the cruel killing of a single animal does nothing to change these circumstances. If Americans really cared more about animals than people, we would not have some of the laxest animal protection laws in the world, and we wouldn’t directly participate in the larger structural forces that allow billions of animals to suffer needlessly each year. But we do.']"
How do perishable food companies know the expiration date of their food/drink?,"Perishable food companies determine the expiration date of their food/drink by considering factors such as optimal storage conditions, water activity, microbiological criteria or oxidation[4]. They also use ""sell by"" dates which is an expiration date for how long a grocery store can display that food[1]. Additionally, they use ""use by"" or ""freeze by"" dates, which are indicators of when the product is at peak quality and flavor[5]. Finally, they use BlakBear sensors, which help to mitigate food waste caused by fixed expiration dates[5].","['Fresh meat, poultry and fish are highly perishable so they have “sell by” dates. This is an expiration date for how long a grocery store can display that food. Purchase the food product before the expiration date on the package.

If the food product has a “sell-by” date or no date, cook or freeze the product by the times in the chart below.', ""Nonperishable items like grains and dried and canned goods can still be used well past their label dates, but with meat, dairy, and eggs, it's a different story. Although there are still no federally regulated expiration dates on those items, they obviously have shorter shelf lives. According to Sana Mujahid, Ph.D., manager of food-safety research at Consumer Reports, the best way to know whether a perishable food has spoiled is simply to “trust your taste buds and sense of smell.”"", 'The sell-by date, often referred to as the expiration date, is the company’s estimate of when a food item will taste best, its optimal date. “You want people to eat and enjoy the product when it’s at its peak, because that’s going to increase their enjoyment, [and] encourage them to buy it again,” he said.', 'The expiration date is indicated on perishable products with biological risk(s), meaning its consumption after that date can generate some degree of food poisoning. This date depends largely on factors such as optimal storage conditions, water activity, microbiological criteria or oxidation.', 'Grell says the BlakBear sensor can mitigate food waste caused by fixed expiration dates. About 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted globally each year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Part of the problem is that consumers misinterpret those conventional date labels. Sell-by dates designate when a product is at peak quality and flavor and are not indicators of food safety, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But many consumers mistakenly throw away edible food based on those conservative expiration dates.']"
How is Noise Pollution dangerous?,"Noise pollution is dangerous because it can cause increased stress levels, sleep disturbance, and hearing damage. It is defined as any noise above 65 decibels (dB)[4], and it can be especially painful at 120 dB[4]. Noise pollution can also interfere with an animal's ability to attract a mate, communicate, navigate, find food, or avoid predators, and can even be an existential threat to vulnerable organisms[5]. Additionally, noise pollution in the ocean is especially serious and can be caused by ships, seismic tests, and oil drills, and can lead to mass strandings of whales and dolphins[5].","['The thing is, noise pollution poses a threat to both our health as well as the attractiveness of a city.', 'Noise pollution occurs when unwanted sounds enter the environment. The potential health effects of noise pollution include increased stress levels, sleep disturbance, or hearing damage.', 'Compared to other types of pollution, people often overlook noise pollution as a health hazard. A 2018 review notes it as an underreported factor. However, many people are experiencing a rise in noise pollution due to an increase in human activity.', 'Not all sound is considered noise pollution. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines noise above 65 decibels (dB) as noise pollution. To be precise, noise becomes harmful when it exceeds 75 decibels (dB) and is painful above 120 dB. As a consequence, it is recommended noise levels be kept below 65 dB during the day and indicates that restful sleep is impossible with nighttime ambient noise levels in excess of 30 dB.', 'Noise pollution also impacts wildlife. A wide range of animals, including insects, frogs, birds, and bats, rely on sound for a variety of reasons. Noise pollution can interfere with an animal’s ability to attract a mate, communicate, navigate, find food, or avoid predators and thus can even be an existential threat to vulnerable organisms. The problem of noise pollution is especially serious for marine animals, particularly those that rely on echolocation, such as certain whales and dolphins, and much of the world’s oceans are polluted with chaotic sounds from ships, seismic tests, and oil drills. Some of the loudest and most detrimental sounds in the sea are from naval sonar devices, whose noise can travel hundreds of miles through the water and is associated with mass strandings of whales and dolphins.']"
"Why do humans need a variety of sustenance in order to stave off malnutrition, but many animals can live on only a single food?","Humans need a variety of sustenance in order to stave off malnutrition because many plant foods lack one or more essential nutrients, or are low in readily digestible carbohydrates, which provide energy[3]. In addition, agricultural societies rely on a few staple crops, which can lead to decreased dietary diversity and carry the risk of malnutrition compared to a more diverse diet[4]. Furthermore, the large distance between trees of the same species in tropical forests complicates food gathering[5]. In contrast, many animals can live on only a single food because they have evolved morphological changes that allow them to survive on lower-quality plant parts.","['Despite agriculture’s tremendous productivity, food shortages, malnutrition, and famines are common around the world. How can this be? Many people assume that the world’s agricultural systems are not capable of producing enough food for everyone, but this is incorrect. Evidence from agricultural research demonstrates that there is enough worldwide agricultural capacity to feed everyone on the planet. The problem is that this capacity is unevenly distributed. Some countries produce much more food than they need, and others much less. In addition, distribution systems are inefficient and much food is lost to waste or spoilage. It is also true that in an agricultural economy food costs money, and worldwide many people who are starving or undernourished lack food because they cannot pay for it, not because food itself is unavailable.', 'Another morphological change that can facilitate survival on lower-quality plant parts is to grow larger over time. Compared with small animals, big ones must consume greater absolute amounts of food to nourish their more extensive tissue mass. But, for reasons that are imperfectly understood, the bigger animals can actually attain adequate nourishment by taking in less energy per unit of body mass. This relatively lower energy demand means larger animals can meet their energy requirements with lower-quality foods. Growing bigger has been only a limited option for most primates, however. If arboreal animals grow too massive, they risk breaking the branches underneath their feet and falling to the ground.', 'The dietary challenges that trees and vines pose do not end there. Many plant foods lack one or more nutrients required by animals, such as particular vitamins or amino acids (the building blocks of protein), or else they are low in readily digestible carbohydrates (starch and sugar), which provide glucose and therefore energy. Usually, then, animals that depend primarily on plants for meeting their daily nutritional requirements must seek out a variety of complementary nutrient sources, a demand that greatly complicates food gathering.', 'The first characteristic of agriculture is reliance on a few staple crops, foods that form the backbone of the subsistence system. An example of a staple crop would be rice in China, or potatoes in Ireland. In agricultural societies, farmers generally grow a surplus of these staple crops, more than they need for their own tables, which are then sold for profit. The reliance on a single plant species, or mono-cropping, can lead to decreased dietary diversity and carries the risk of malnutrition compared to a more diverse diet. Other risks include crop failure associated with bad weather conditions or blight, leading to famine and malnutrition, conditions that are common in agricultural communities.', 'The need to mix and match plant foods is further exacerbated by the large distance between trees of the same species in tropical forests, which include hundreds of tree species. An animal that concentrated on eating food from a single species would have to exert great effort going from one individual of that species to another. What is more, trees exhibit seasonal peaks and valleys in the production of the fruits and young leaves primates like to eat, again making reliance on a single food species untenable.']"
"You couldn't kill bacteria with 102° water, so why does your body heat up while you're sick?","Fever is a sign that the immune system is working to fight off an infectious organism, such as a virus or bacteria[3]. Most viruses and bacteria have a hard time surviving above normal human body temperature of 98.6°F[5], and temperatures of 140°F to 150°F are enough to kill most viruses[1]. By increasing the body temperature, it can slow down the ability of a virus to multiply and make it harder for it to survive[4].","['According to WHO, temperatures of 140°F to 150°F are enough to kill most viruses, and boiling water makes it safe from pathogens like bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Trivedi recommends a temperature of 160°F or greater when heating water or food products, to kill off bacteria like Legionella, a common bacteria found in water.', 'By making the body hotter, it may help kill off the infectious organism.

Your brilliant body raises its temperature to “burn out” the virus or bacteria, because it is harder for it to survive at a higher temperature.', 'Similarly, people who are admitted to intensive care units with infections and a slightly raised temperature tend to fare better than those who have a normal temperature, or one higher than 40°C. One reason for this may be that bacteria and viruses find it easier to replicate and infect cells at temperatures below 37°C. “By increasing your body temperature, you may be slowing down the ability of a virus to multiply,” says Davis.', 'The first thing to understand is that most viruses and bacteria have a hard time surviving above normal human body temperature, which can vary by age, activity, and time of day, but is generally accepted as 98.6 degrees F, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']"

There is also a lot of competition in the film industry and many people who go to film school end up finding they prefer and excel in other areas of filmmaking such as editing or cinematography[4]. Finally, going to film school can provide more than just knowledge of the film industry, such as making friends and learning how to work in a team, and many people who have gone to film school have developed important skills and gained valuable experience[5].","[""If you are going to film school, my one piece of advice is this: don't think you're better than anyone. If you look around the classroom and think you're the best writer/director/DP/editor in the room: forget about it. Plenty of people with more talent than you have failed in this difficult industry. Unlike in a sport like track and field, for example, there are few ways of objectively measuring and rewarding ability in film — and it can be incredibly difficult just to gain access to the track, as it were. It might take decades to find your niche, your approach, and your voice, so if you're enrolling in a film school (or not, for that matter), my advice is to stay humble... and make friends."", '3.

These people should avoid film school because they (the majority) will not do anything after.', 'Media titan Barry Diller once said, ""there\'s not that much talent in the world, and talent always outs."" Which is to say, if you\'re going to make it, you\'ll find a way — regardless of how long it takes, and regardless of the particular obstacles you encounter. Film school can help you become a better filmmaker — it can refine what\'s already there, and it may accelerate your development (and debt) — but if you don\'t have the motivation and grit necessary to overcome the disappointments and failures you are sure to encounter, even the most prestigious degree won\'t help. If you\'ve got what it takes, you\'ll eventually make it, whether you go to film school or not! In light of Diller\'s reasoning, it\'s harder to argue for paying to learn (in a school) over getting paid to learn (in a job).', 'It is. It’s a lot of competition.

But on the flip side I got more out of my degree than just how to use a camera and critique a film. Honestly the biggest things I took away from film school was the chance to just make films and not have to worry about making money off of them or getting them distributed while at the same time making some of the best friends I know today. I wouldn\'t have gotten the internship that eventually turned into a job and most importantly college was an overall great experience. I know not everyone has the means to go to school and not everyone works well in that setting but for me I have no regrets.']"

Why do foods that are bad for you taste better than things that are healthy?,"There are several reasons why unhealthy foods can taste better than healthy foods. One is that plants are readily available in nature and their bitterness can tell our brains that they might be poisonous, so the brain may be more drawn to unhealthy foods for this reason. Another is that humans require sodium and fat, which are both present in unhealthy foods, and these trigger serotonin in the brain, which can lead to a pleasure overdrive[4]. Additionally, unhealthy foods provide more energy and calmness, which the brain is aware of and sends signals to draw us towards them[5].","['So why does healthy food taste so nasty?

But is it true? Does healthy food taste bad? Read this article to unravel this issue and find out how you can live a healthier lifestyle without giving up the taste.', 'Healthy food sometimes tastes bad while harmful foods taste good because of evolutionary reasons (7). Ancient humans had an abundance of plants around them, so their body didn’t need to develop a mechanism which would spur them to eat more plants. What humans really did require, and what was then in short supply, is sodium. Why does salt make food taste better? Because it triggers serotonin. The same goes for fat and sugar that are great and dense sources of energy. With the modernization humans learned to make foods next-level salty, fatty, and sugary – the combination that sends our brains into a pleasure overdrive. Yet it is simply too much, and inflicts irreparable harm on our body.', 'Since we now know the scientific reason behind craving unhealthy food, it makes sense why healthy choices taste bad to us.

[America] Why Do Medical Fundraisers Still Ask For Full Cost Of Treatment Instead Of Insurance Premiums?,"Medical fundraisers often ask for full cost of treatment instead of insurance premiums because of the limitations of insurance coverage and the inadequacy of available charity programs to cover the costs of medical bills. The limited evidence available also shows that most healthcare fundraisers on crowdfunding platforms are unable to meet their financial targets, with only around 11% of them being funded in full[3].

So there is crowdfunding, small foundations like the Pendergast Fund, hospital-charity programs for the needy, and disease-specific resources.

How is aborting a pregnancy because the child would be special needs not eugenics?,"Aborting a pregnancy because the child would be special needs is not eugenics because it does not depend on eugenicist intentions and is not the product of a eugenics conspiracy[1]. While abortion is not a eugenics conspiracy, it does have a disproportionately eugenicist effect[1][3]. Furthermore, there is no evidence that early abortion advocates ever favored abortion for gender-eugenics purposes[5].","['But what is one to make of the glaring evidence of a shockingly disparate impact of abortion? Even if abortion is not designed for eugenics purposes, it unquestionably has disproportionately eugenicist effects. The abortion right is not a racial, or gender, or disability classification, in terms. It does not depend on eugenicist intentions and is not the product of a eugenics conspiracy. But those possessing the abortion right exercise it in a fashion so as to abort more Black babies, more girls, and more “defective” children.', 'The reality is that our current constitutional law allows abortion for any reason, including a eugenics reason. The result is that abortions can be obtained, and are obtained, on account of the race, sex, or disability of the child that otherwise would be born.', 'My contention is that Justice Thomas has it mostly right and that Murray’s critique falls wide of the mark. While abortion is not a eugenics conspiracy — a deliberate plot to reduce the size of the African American, female, or disabled populations — it remains an undeniable fact that the aborted are disproportionately racial minorities, female, and those with disabilities.15×15. See infra Part II, pp. 421–26. Abortion, in short, has a markedly disparate impact along lines of race, sex, and disability. This in itself is troubling, even if it is not proof of deliberate design — which Thomas never claims it is. Thomas does fairly highlight, however, the disturbing history of eugenics arguments for the desirability of liberalized abortion.', 'Swallow hard and acknowledge the truth of what these numbers reveal, particularly for abortions predicated on sex or disability. Abortion is often employed for eugenics purposes — especially for sex selection and disability elimination. Abortion is used by women and men to kill girls because they are girls. Abortions are obtained in substantial numbers in order to cull the disabled, before birth, because they are disabled. And, while it seems unlikely that an abortion would be obtained specifically because the child is Black, the exercise of the right to legal abortion definitely has a racially disparate eugenic impact.', 'Begin with Justice Thomas’s Box concurrence itself. Thomas’s opinion compiles an impressive and rightly disturbing narrative of evidence that family planning and abortion advocates in the past embraced the desirability of abortion as an instrument for achieving racial eugenics and for culling persons with disabilities from the population. (There appears to be no evidence that early abortion advocates ever favored abortion for gender-eugenics purposes — aborting girls because they are girls.18×18.

Why do people in Indian soap operas start speaking English randomly or adding English words in the middle of sentences? Is that common and how did they get to this point?,"English is used randomly and mixed into Indian language sentences in Indian soap operas for various reasons. One reason is that English is a stress-timed language, whereas Indian native languages are syllable-timed languages[1]. This can lead to Indian speakers pronouncing words with the wrong syllables or accentuating all the syllables of a long English word[1]. North Indians often speak with a non-rhotic accent and South Indians with a rhotic accent, which can also lead to confusion[2]. Additionally, American English has become a part of everyday usage in India due to globalisation, with people using words such as ""cool"" and ""OK"". Lastly, due to the confusion created by the use of the Devanagari grapheme, many Indians replace the voiced alveolar fricative /z/ with the voiced palatal affricate (or postalveolar) /dʒ/[5], making words such as zero and rosy sound as [ˈdʒiːro] and [ˈroːdʒiː].[5]","['English is a stress-timed language. Both syllable stress and word stress (where only certain words in a sentence or phrase are stressed) are important features of Received Pronunciation. Indian native languages are actually syllable-timed languages, like French. Indian-English speakers usually speak with a syllabic rhythm. Further, in some Indian languages, stress is associated with a low pitch, whereas in most English dialects, stressed syllables are generally pronounced with a higher pitch. Thus, when some Indian speakers speak, they appear to put the stress accents at the wrong syllables, or accentuate all the syllables of a long English word. Certain Indian accents possess a ""sing-song"" quality, a feature seen in a few English dialects of Britain, such as Scouse and Welsh English.', '- North Indians, especially a minority of English students and teachers along with some people in various professions like telephone customer service agents, often speak with a non-rhotic accent. Examples of this include flower pronounced as [flaʊ.ə], never as [nevə], water as [ʋɒtə], etc. Some South Indians, however, like native Telugu speakers speak with a rhotic accent, but the final /ə/ becomes an [a], and an alveolar tap [ɾ] is used for /r/, resulting in water and never as [wɒtaɾ] or [ʋɒʈaɾ] and [nevaɾ] respectively.', '40. ^ a b Reddy, C.

A significant portion of Indians thus, even though their native languages do have its nearest equivalent: the unvoiced /s/, often use the voiced palatal affricate (or postalveolar) /dʒ/, just as with a Korean accent. This makes words such as ⟨zero⟩ and ⟨rosy⟩ sound as [ˈdʒiːro] and [ˈroːdʒiː] (the latter, especially in the North). This replacement is equally true for Persian and Arabic loanwords into Hindi. The probable reason is the confusion created by the use of the Devanagari grapheme ⟨ज⟩ (for /dʒ/) with a dot beneath it to represent /z/ (as ⟨ज़⟩). This is common among people without formal English education. In Telugu, /z/ and /dʒ/ are allophones, so words such as rosy /ˈɹəʊzi/ become /'roːdʒi/ and words such as fridge /fɹɪdʒ/ become /friz/. The same happens in Bengali as well.""]"
Why isn't anyone(as in a country) doing anything to help Syria? What is going on?,"The main reason why there is not much action being taken to help Syria is because the conflict is not seen as central to U.S. strategic interests, and politically, Syria has always been an adversary to the United States[2]. Additionally, the international community is facing difficulties in providing humanitarian aid due to politicization[1] and the need for proper documentation and protocols to be followed[1][3]. Furthermore, some countries have withheld aid and are peddling false claims to carry out their anti-Syria objectives[5], while the Syrian Government has also preconditioned or instrumentalized aid[3], which has further hindered the efforts to help Syria. Lastly, it is difficult to support reconstruction efforts in Syria due to the sanctions imposed on the country.","['MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon), expressing deep concern about the deteriorating situation in Syria, said “there is no genuine hope on the horizon”. Humanitarian aid is desperately needed, food insecurity is rising and the vast majority of the population now lives below the poverty threshold. “This is morally unbearable,” he stressed, emphasizing that the international community must remobilize to help those most in need. Emphasizing that aid must not be subject to politicization, he cited the need for provisions to ensure that humanitarian assistance can be traced and for the proper documentation and protocols to be followed. He went on to advocate for more support for early recovery projects, noting that the Syrian Government has authorized some action in that area, and paid tribute to humanitarian workers who continue to risk their lives to help the country’s people.', 'Despite deep flaws in the assumptions underlying the administration’s policy, advocates of engagement inevitably run up against the ultimate defense of inaction: Syria just isn’t worth it. Supporters of the administration’s approach regularly fall back on the claim that the Syrian conflict is simply not central to U.S. strategic interests. Politically, they note, Syria has always been an adversary to the United States. Economically, its ties to the United States are trivial. However wrenching the conflict might be, the United States has little at stake in its outcome.', 'NATHALIE BROADHURST ESTIVAL (France) said that 90 per cent of Syria’s population lives under the poverty line and its children only know of war, urging an end to hostilities. The recommendation by the Panel of Experts to improve the deconfliction mechanism must be implemented. With the need for medical aid rising, Syria must respect international humanitarian law. Stressing the importance of impartiality of humanitarian aid, she said Syria has preconditioned or instrumentalized aid, which is a mistake. The European Union is a major donor and will remain so. However, without a political settlement, there is no durable solution. France’s position on lifting sanctions and reconstruction remains unchanged.

Such acts, as well as those of States who withheld assistance to the humanitarian response plan for Syria, obstruct his country’s implementation of resolution 2585 (2021), impede its efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and hamper safe conditions for the return of the displaced, he said.']"
How can enough oxygen remain in crowded cities where there are very few plants to photosynthesize the CO2?,"One way enough oxygen can remain in crowded cities with few plants to photosynthesize the CO2 is by growing Cyanobacteria in ponds near power plants, which takes in 6 CO2 and 6 H2O to produce a sugar and releases 3 O2’s into the atmosphere[1]. Another way is to burn plants for energy at a power plant, capture and store the resulting emissions, and then use the CO2 for enhanced oil recovery or inject it into the earth where it is sequestered in geologic formations[2]. Additionally, some plants, like cacti, bromeliads, and certain succulents, rely on an alternative photosynthetic pathway called crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), which allows them to keep their leaf stomata closed during the day to reduce water loss and release some oxygen at night when the stomata open[3]. Lastly, some plants follow the C3 pathway, which is energetically the most efficient and allows plants to absorb more CO2, but comes at the cost of losing water through the same stomata if they are opened[4]. During photosynthesis, plants use things like water, sunlight, and carbon dioxide to create food and oxygen[3][5].","['The problem with sequestering CO2 is the fact that you are sequestering twice as much Oxygen. Cyanobacteria got rid of an atmosphere of almost all CO2 3 billion years ago. Why not use it again. Grow Cyanobacteria in ponds near every power plant ( all power plants except nuclear, produce CO2) and capture the CO2 and use it to grow the Cyanobacteria. It takes in 6 CO2 and 6 H2O to produce a sugar and it releases 3 O2’s into the atmosphere. And then dry the sugar and store it or use it as needed. Fish farms will buy it. Look at all the cyanobacteria slime that appears in every lake, river and stream in the entire world. Google “blue green algae” to see what it does in Florida. Cyanobacteria grows very fast. We have to be careful, we may lower the CO2 level below what plants need.', 'If we burn plants for energy at a power plant and capture and store the resulting emissions, the CO2 the plants previously absorbed is removed from the atmosphere. The CO2 can then be used for enhanced oil recovery or injected into the earth where it is sequestered in geologic formations.', 'Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use energy from the sun to make food. They use carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil to make sugar and oxygen. Most plants release oxygen only during the day, when the sun can power photosynthesis. The exceptions to this general rule are the plants (mostly cacti, bromeliads, and certain succulents) that rely on an alternative photosynthetic pathway called crassulacean acid metabolism, or CAM, which allows them to keep their leaf stomata closed during the day to reduce water loss. These plants do release some oxygen at night when the stomata open and the oxygen can escape.', 'Plants have evolved different pathways by which photosynthesis can take place. A vast majority of plant species (85%) follow the C3 pathway, so named because the starting point is a molecule with three carbon atoms. This pathway dominates the plant kingdom because it is energetically most efficient (except in highly arid or hot conditions, where other pathways are favoured). Yet, it comes at a price. If C3 plants open their stomata – tiny valves on the leaf surface – to absorb CO2, they lose water through the same valves. And losing water means risking hydraulic failure and death, especially when the soil is dry. Therefore, C3 plants face a fundamental dilemma: should they open their stomata wide to absorb more CO2, or should they keep them closed to avoid hydraulic failure?', 'During photosynthesis, plants use things like water, sunlight, and carbon dioxide to create food and oxygen. Because of this, most plants including trees can only create oxygen during the day. At night, the process is reversed. Trees give off carbon dioxide and absorb oxygen in a process called respiration.']"
Why are dogs one of the few animals that form strong attachments to people and bond really well with humans?,"Dogs are one of the few animals that form strong attachments to people and bond really well with humans because they are equipped with outstanding skills to understand human emotions, gestures, and actions[1], and they form cooperative teams with us[1]. Additionally, strong evidence suggests that it is an emotional bond more than a cognitive one[3]. This is evidenced by the fact that dogs bond with other species with ease and willingness[3][4]. Furthermore, dogs form their strongest bonds when they are very young, so if they are raised with a baby of another species, they will bond with them very strongly[5].","['Dogs are deeply entrenched in interactions with humans, for which they are equipped with outstanding skills to understand human emotions, gestures, and actions. They form cooperative teams with us (e.g., as assistance, rescue, or herding dogs), they engage with us as communicative partners, and they have been enculturated in our society and are clearly part of our social game. Bonds between humans and dogs can be very intense and even resemble parent–infant attachment bonds. It seems to be this specific relationship of shared understanding and close affiliation that is at the heart of the view that dogs are indeed humans’ best friend.', 'One researcher argues that a dog’s ability to bond has more to do with forming emotional attachments than being smart about what humans want.', 'As of now, the scientific community is divided on the factors that make dogs so attached. Some believe it’s their cognitive ability to understand and communicate with humans. But there’s compelling evidence that this is an emotional bond more than a cognitive one. One of the factors that makes a strong argument for emotional attachment is the ease and willingness with which dogs bond with other species. Is it true love and empathy? That’s not clear. According to Dr. Coren, dogs have the same emotional maturity as a two- to three-year-old toddler, and empathy often takes a few more years in human children. But it’s very clear that dogs can feel attached to and protective of many others species, even penguins.', 'That, by itself, says something about the bond that humans and dogs share. We live with cats, we work with horses, we hire cows for their milk and chickens for their eggs and pay them with food—unless we kill them and eat them instead. Our lives are entangled with those of other species, but we could disentangle if we wanted.', 'There’s also a very obvious reason a dog may bond with another type of animal: the two are raised together. Animals form their strongest bonds when they’re very young, so if a dog is raised with a baby of another species, it makes sense that they’ll bond to each other. The connection could be even stronger than later learning or other instinctual behavior.']"
why the american corn taste different from middle eastern corn or Asian one?,"The American corn taste different from middle eastern corn or Asian one because it has been bred and hybridized over time to be sweeter than traditional varieties. The most popular corn in China is waxy corn, which is characterized by its sticky texture when cooked due to larger amounts of amylopectin[2]. In 1950, Dr. J.R. Laughnan at the University of Illinois discovered a distinct and very sweet strain of corn with a gene known as “shrunken two” and this discovery transformed the sweet corn industry, making way for new varieties of corn that were “supersweet,” “ultrasweet” and “extrasweet”[3]. These new breeds have transformed traditional corn's flavor and texture, making it more sugary and less creamy[5].","['Waxy corn on the cob is popular in China and Southeast Asia, and may be found in frozen or precooked forms in Chinatowns. Waxy corn is the most popular corn in China for fresh consumption. The waxy texture is familiar and preferred by people in East Asia since items such as tapioca pearls, glutinous rice, and mochi have similar textures.[citation needed]', 'Waxy corn or glutinous corn is a type of field corn characterized by its sticky texture when cooked as a result of larger amounts of amylopectin. The corn was first described from a specimen from China in 1909. As this plant showed many peculiar traits, the American breeders long used it as a genetic marker to tag the existence of hidden genes in other maize breeding programs. In 1922 a researcher found that the endosperm of waxy maize contained only amylopectin and no amylose starch molecule in opposition to normal dent corn varieties that contain both. Until World War II, the main source of starch in the United States was tapioca, but when Japan severed the supply lines of the U.S., they forced processors to turn to waxy maize. Amylopectin or waxy starch is now used mainly in food products, but also in the textile, adhesive, corrugating and paper industry.', 'It is an illusion, however, to imagine that corn on the cob is something eternal and unchanging. Farmers market corn may look remarkably similar to the corn of the Aztecs (minus the amazing range of colors), but more than 90% of the fresh corn for sale in the U.S. now consists of modern hybrids that are far sweeter than corn ever used to be. In 1950, Dr. J.R. Laughnan at the University of Illinois discovered a distinct and very sweet strain of corn with a gene known as “shrunken two” because the kernels shriveled up when they dried. Laughnan’s discovery transformed the sweet corn industry, making way for new varieties of corn that were “supersweet,” “ultrasweet” and “extrasweet.” Anyone born later than the 1980s may not even remember the taste of old corn, which could be gloriously milky in texture but deeply unreliable in its sweetness.', 'Biochemists confirm that we are indeed people made of corn. Because of its unusual photosynthesis, corn leaves a signature in our tissues written in its particular ratio of carbon isotopes. Corn-eating peoples of the Americas carry a very different ratio of these isotopes in their flesh than the wheat eaters of Europe or the rice eaters of Asia. One biochemist concluded that Americans are basically “walking Fritos.” If you walk through the grocery store reading labels, you’ll find that nearly 70 percent of processed foods contain corn in some form: corn syrup, corn oil, corn starch, and more. Eggs, dairy, and meat find their way to our plates and into our cells through feed corn. Corn is the keystone of our food chain. How ironic that the conquistadors were at first fearful of eating this delicious grain, thinking that if they ate the food of “savages,” they would become like them. Unfortunately, that fear proved to be ungrounded.', 'New breeds have transformed corn’s traditional flavor and texture, making it more sugary and less creamy']"
"In parts of India where cows are worshipped, what do they think about milk?","In parts of India where cows are worshipped, milk is seen as a sacred gift. Hindus consider cows to be sacred embodiments of Kamdhenu[1], and honour, respect, and adore the cow[1][2][5]. Cow worship is embedded within the Indian culture[3][5], and the cow is depicted as accompanying several gods in Hindu mythology[1][4]. Hindus demonstrate their admiration for cows by celebrating the Gopashtama festival, selling cow-related jewellery and clothing at fairs, and decorating cows with garlands, paint, and ornaments[5]. Milk and ghee are also essential elements in Hindu worship, penance, and rites of passage. Many Hindus abstain from eating beef as a sign of respect for cows.[5]","['Milk’s special significance in India goes back to Hindu mythology and the legend of the Samudra manthan, the churning of the ocean that brought forth the drink of immortality, the amrit, and also the goddess Kamdhenu, which manifested itself as a wish-granting divine cow.

how to do this trig problem,"To solve a trigonometric problem, first determine the right function to use (tan, sin, and cos) based off of which sides are given (Hyp, Adj, Opp).

Novice learners, however, may not necessarily recognize the similarity between the source example and the target problem without a teacher’s scaffolding. To facilitate analogical learning, the first stage involves a mental representation of three variants of source examples in terms of a solution procedure (Figure 1).

Why does a horse need to be put down if they break a leg??  a dog or cat doesnt,"Horses are usually put down if they break a leg because it is very difficult for the broken leg to heal correctly due to the horse's weight and the fact that they spend the majority of their time standing[3][4]. Surgery is also often not an option as the bone is usually shattered[4], and even if surgery is possible, there are significant risks associated with the healing process such as re-injury, laminitis, and abscesses[4]. Furthermore, amputating the broken leg is usually not an option as horses are heavier than other animals and must be able to get up and down from a lying position, which is impossible with three legs given their weight distribution[5].","[""It seems to be a common, and to me upsetting, theme that if a horse breaks its leg it gets put down but this doesn't hold true for some other animals. For example, if a dog or cat breaks its leg the same outcome isn't applied. Indeed, I've seen many healthy dogs and cats with just three legs (although likely not caused by a broken leg)."", 'This is a great answer, but I guess there is a little more: It is not cost effective. Some owners might be attached to their horses but they generally like to ride them, which is hard to do when the horse has broken a leg.

But a horse would be of no good and quite expensive to take care with a broken foot.', 'A horse with a broken leg is usually put down because it’s very difficult for the broken leg of a horse to heal correctly.

The most common reason is that the majority of times, the horse has shattered their leg bone, making surgery impossible. If surgery can be done, there are still significant risks. Horses spend the majority of their time standing (even when they sleep) and they have a very high flight risk, both of which increase the risk of re-injury during the healing period. Also, 60 to 65 percent of their weight is on their front legs, increasing the chance of developing crippling conditions like laminitis and abscesses during recovery. Other factors include severe pain, infection and the high cost of treatment.', ""You usually can't save the horse's life just by amputating the broken leg. Horses aren't like dogs, which can usually live a fairly active lifestyle on three legs. Horses are heavier and this weight can cause problems for the other hooves.

The last Aaron Swartz question. Why don't we have access to publicly funded scientific journals that hide behind pay walls? Is there anything we can do about it?,"There are a few reasons why we don't have access to publicly funded scientific journals that hide behind paywalls. One is that the big publishers deny public access to their journals. Another is that the antiquated and clumsy modes of publishing that the industry employs holds back scientific research[1]. Advocates of open access, such as Aaron Swartz, have challenged this system, and proposed solutions such as establishing a fund for universities to draw from according to how often their work is accessed[2]. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has recently issued a policy calling for taxpayer-funded research to be made available to the public at no cost[4], affirming the principle that taxpayers should be able to see the fruits of their spending[5].","['Alexandra Elbakyan lives in hiding, beyond the jurisdiction of the US courts, and moves Sci-Hub between domains as it gets taken down.

Advocates like Stevan Harnad, Björn Brembs, Peter Suber and Michael Eisen have changed the public mood. The brilliant online innovator Aaron Swartz sought to release 5m scientific articles into the public domain. Facing the possibility of decades in a US federal prison for this selfless act, he took his life.', 'Finally and perhaps most importantly, MIT should encourage other universities to participate in this effort. Specifically, it should establish a fund that pays for the true costs of publishing academic journals. Call it the Aaron Swartz Memorial Open-Access Fund. Instead of paying exorbitant subscription fees to for-profit journals, universities would instead contribute to the fund. (The amount would be a function of a school’s size and research budget.) Journals would draw from the fund according to how often their work is accessed. It’s not unlike the compulsory license system that pays musicians when their work is covered or played on the radio, except instead of allowing for more poppy renditions of Elvis tunes, this fund would let anyone in the world access any academic article at any time.', 'We’re a long way from living in world where all scientific publications are open access. But I’m hopeful that this will happen in my lifetime. And if/when it happens, we need to remember Aaron Swartz. He sacrificed everything for the open-access movement.

"Why do we talk to babies, pets, and old people with the same cooing high-pitched voice?","It is believed that humans naturally adjust their way of talking when they know that the person or animal they’re talking to doesn’t speak their language[2]. This is why we often talk to babies, pets, and old people with the same cooing high-pitched voice. Studies have shown that when talking to dogs, humans typically use higher-pitched, slower tempo speech with a greater degree of variation in pitch than when talking to each other[2][4]. This implies that humans use this kind of speech pattern when they want to facilitate interaction with a non-speaking listener[2][4]. Also, puppies seem to enjoy this high pitched baby talk [1], and it could be down to dogs showing an innate receptiveness to high-pitched sounds in puppies[5].","['Researchers have found evidence that the high-pitched baby talk we use to interact with our dogs is largely ignored by our older pooches, though puppies seem to enjoy it.', 'The way humans talk to animals might provide some answers on why we love speaking to dogs and cats. As mentioned, pet-directed speech and baby talk have a lot in common. They both are slower, more melodic and of a higher pitch than adult-directed speech. What this means is that humans might naturally adjust their way of talking when they know that the person or animal they’re talking to doesn’t speak your language. Studies have even found that English speakers use some features of infant-directed speech when talking to non-native English speakers (which, yes, can come across as very condescending).', 'But Catherine Laing, a researcher in neuroscience at Duke University in North Carolina who was not involved in the study, disagreed with the suggestion that similarities in the pitch of baby-talk and pet-talk indicates a link to non-speaking listeners. She points out that the two forms of speech have many differences – not only in the type of words used and how they are articulated, but also in the interactions between listener and adult.', 'The researchers found that when talking to dogs, humans typically use higher-pitched, slower tempo speech with a greater degree of variation in pitch than when talking to each other. The effect was most pronounced when chatting to puppies, with participants increasing their pitch by 21% on average compared to normal speech.Mathevon says the results, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B by researchers from the UK, US and France, provide clues as to why humans address their pets in a similar way to babies. “The fact that human speakers employ dog-directed speech to communicate with dogs of all ages is interesting because it could mean that we use this kind of speech pattern when we want to facilitate interaction with a non-speaking listener, and not only a juvenile listener,” said Mathevon.', 'That is unexpected, the authors say, and could be down to dogs showing less interest in the voices of strangers as they age. Alternatively, the use of dog-directed speech might tap into an innate receptiveness to high-pitched sounds in puppies – a trait that disappears as they age.']"

why do animals seem so scared by humans but not by other animals,"Wild animals fear humans more than any other predator because they perceive us as a threat and will actively try to avoid us and even change their feeding habits to do so[1]. This is likely because some animals have learned to become wary of humans due to living in heavily populated areas[3]. Studies have been conducted to determine the level of fear animals feel towards humans and have shown that they react very strongly to our perceived presence[4][5]. Furthermore, humans kill many animals at much higher rates than their other natural predators, and also take out their predators[5], which could explain why animals are more scared of humans than other animals.[1]","['Both these studies prove that wild animals are so fearful of humans and perceive us as such a threat that they will actively try and avoid us and even change their feeding habits in order to be able to do so.

These studies were not done on prey animals, which one could argue have a natural defense mechanism to be scared and skittish, but rather on middle food web and even apex predators.', 'Similar studies have shown that animals react very strongly to the perceived presence of spiders, hawks, sharks, and wolves. But what about humans? We kill many animals at much higher rates than their other natural predators, and we’re unusual in taking out those predators too. “We might expect animals to fear us, as any prey fears its predators,” says Suraci.']"
How can there be no natural predators for rabbits in Australia?,"The success of rabbits in Australia is due to a variety of factors. One factor is the lack of feral predators, such as cats and foxes, which can help to sustain their predation on native animals. Another factor is that rabbit warrens provide a refuge for native species such as echidnas and large reptiles[4], as well as shelter and dens for cats and foxes, thus helping these predators to persist in hot, arid areas[4]. Additionally, rabbits are able to successfully reproduce as their warrens provide them with protection from environmental extremes, such as temperature extremes[5].","['The introduction of the rabbit has also strained the native wildlife of Australia. Rabbits have been blamed for the destruction of the eremophila plant and various species of trees. Because rabbits will feed on seedlings, many trees are never able to reproduce, leading to local extinction. Additionally, due to direct competition for food and habitat, the population of many native animals, such as the greater bilby and the pig-footed bandicoot, has declined dramatically.', '- Fewer feral predators.

Why do chickens lay eggs so quickly and efficiently?,"Chickens lay eggs so quickly and efficiently because of a combination of factors. Heritage vs. industrial breed plays a role in the speed and quantity a hen lays eggs[1], and hens will begin laying when the amount of daylight reaches 14 hours per day during early spring, with maximum egg laying occurring when the day length reaches 16 hours per day[2]. It is important to manage pullets correctly in terms of nutrition and light management[3], as the flock will come into production quickly, peak, and then slowly reduce the level of production[3][4]. Additionally, research has shown that laying hens have good cognitive abilities and are able to learn complex tasks, which may be in response to the high selection pressure on productivity[5].","['While heritage vs. industrial breed plays a vital role in the speed and quantity a hen lays eggs, it’s not a matter of how long the chicken will lay because they can lay eggs up until the day they die, even if it’s old.', 'Raising chickens for egg production can be rewarding and challenging. The amount of daylight hours affects a chicken’s reproductive cycle. Hens will begin laying when the amount of daylight reaches 14 hours per day during early spring. Maximum egg laying will occur when the day length reaches 16 hours per day. This biological marvel is perfectly designed so that chicks hatch in spring and develop and mature during the warmer summer months.', 'It is important to manage pullets correctly, especially in the areas of nutrition and light management, because correct management will affect the level and quality of egg production once the birds start to lay. If the pullets come into production too early, they may have problems with prolapse, which can cause health problems across the flock. Also, the hens may lay smaller eggs throughout the production cycle.', 'Also, hens in a flock do not all begin to lay on exactly the same day, nor do they continue laying for the same length of time. Figure 1 shows a typical egg production curve for a flock. The flock comes into production quickly, peaks, and then slowly reduces the level of production.', 'Taken together, our results demonstrate that laying hens have good cognitive abilities, as they can learn reasonably complex tasks. In contrast to our initial hypotheses, these abilities do not seem to be limited by resource trade-offs, resulting from high selected levels of egg lay capacity. Instead, it seems that the selection for productivity traits has led to changes in learning behavior and the high productive laying hens showed a better learning performance compared to moderate productive hens in a feeding-rewarding context. These higher levels of performance may be in response to constraints imposed by high selection pressure on productivity, resulting in more efficient strategies to gain additional energy, which may ameliorate the trade-offs from selection on high egg yields. Underlying mechanisms for this may be directly related to differences in neuronal structure or indirectly to foraging strategies and changes in personality traits such as fearfulness and sociality.']"
How to calculate how high will the sea level rise because of global warming...,"To calculate how high the sea level will rise due to global warming, we need to consider the current global sea level rise, the local sea level rise from factors other than warming, the amount of fossil fuel use and carbon emissions, the global warming pathways, and the projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC estimates that sea level will rise by 1-2 feet by 2100 if we reduce our emissions, while the U.S. National Climate Assessment estimates that sea level will rise between 2 and 6 feet by 2100[4]. Models consistent with paleo records of sea level rise suggest that the very long-term sea level rise may be dominated by ice loss from Antarctica and could ultimately cause 58 meters (190 feet) of sea level rise[5].","['To estimate how global warming is shifting the odds of high storm surges, through sea level rise, we calculated the odds of extreme events in a hypothetical world with no past or future global sea level rise due to warming, to compare against our original calculations, which included warming. We did this comparison at each water level station in the study. The approach basically translated to subtracting out the roughly 8 inches of historical global sea level rise measured from 1880-2009, and then also assuming no future global sea level rise, for the no-warming scenario at each station. The no-warming scenarios still included local sea level rise from factors other than warming, such as sinking or lifting land — the full local component of sea level rise as this section describes.', 'The best way to minimize future sea level rise is to cut our fossil fuel use and reduce carbon emissions. Even though some sea level rise is inevitable, we have time to reduce how much will occur. There is some debate, but according to one study every 1°C of warming will cause sea level to rise by about 2.3 meters. So the sooner we can slow our warming trend, the easier it will be for future generations to adapt.', 'Every four or five years, NOAA leads an interagency task force that reviews the latest research on sea level rise and issues a report on likely— and ‘unlikely but plausible’—amounts future sea level rise for different greenhouse gas and global warming pathways. In the 2022 report, the task force concluded that even on the pathway with the lowest possible greenhouse gas emissions and warming (1.5 degrees C), global mean sea level would rise at least 0.3 meters (1 foot) above 2000 levels by 2100. On a pathway with very high rates of emissions that trigger rapid ice sheet collapse, sea level could be as much as 2 meters (6.6 feet) higher in 2100 than it was in 2000.', 'The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the international United Nations group tasked with summarizing climate change research every few years. Their 2013 report projected that sea level will rise by 2 to 3 feet by 2100 if we do not slow our carbon dioxide emissions by using less energy or using renewable energy. That is enough to threaten coastal cities and flood island nations. Even if we reduce our emissions, the report predicts that by 2100 sea level will rise by 1-2 feet, which is enough to cause much coastal flooding and erosion. Some scientists consider these estimates to be conservative, and expect greater sea level rise. The U.S. National Climate Assessment, for example, estimates that sea level will rise between 2 and 6 feet by 2100.', 'Models consistent with paleo records of sea level rise: 1189  indicate that substantial long-term SLR will continue for centuries to come even if the temperature stabilizes. After 500 years, sea level rise from thermal expansion alone may have reached only half of its eventual level, which models suggest may lie within ranges of 0.5–2 m (1+1⁄2–6+1⁄2 ft). At the same time, tipping points of Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets are expected to play a larger role over such timescales, with the very long-term SLR likely to be dominated by ice loss from Antarctica, especially if the warming exceeds 2 °C (3.6 °F). Continued carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel sources could cause additional tens of metres of sea level rise, over the next millennia, and the available fossil fuel on Earth is even enough to ultimately melt the entire Antarctic ice sheet, causing about 58 m (190 ft) of sea level rise.']"
"why are male animals more colorful and attractive in the animal world but it is the other way around for humans, where most attention for beauty is towards females?","In the animal world, male animals are usually more colorful and attractive in order to attract female partners, as bright colors and other displays are honest signals of their quality and health[5]. Female birds tend to prefer males with the brightest colors, longest feathers, and the most complicated songs[3][5]. Humans, however, have complex social behaviors and both sexes care about attractiveness. For humans, beauty is all about having face symmetry[2]. Females in humans might also show off as much as males do, but in most animals males are usually the showier ones[4][5]. In humans, sexual beauty is often characterized by being extreme, such as female supermodels being much longer and thinner than most other women in the population, and male supermodels being super-buff[5]. Pornography also creates supernormal stimuli by showcasing individuals with extreme traits and creating social settings that hardly exist in most societies[5].","['In this sense, sexual selection - being hot - and natural selection - being more fit for survival - don\'t always equal the same genetic result. So why do animals desire attractive partners, not well-rounded ones? ""You can\'t take it for granted that organisms had a sense of aesthetic beauty and that it drove the whole sexual selection process,"" evolutionary biologist Adam Jones of Texas A&M University in the US told Melissa Hoggenboom at BBC Earth. ""Scientists had to explain why they had that sense, why do they care about beauty?""', 'But what about humans? For our species, beauty is all about having face symmetry. And, unlike many species, both sexes care about attractiveness. ""Males prefer females with ideal waist-to-hip ratios, while females prefer deeper voices and squarer jaws. Like the peacock\'s tail, these traits are honest markers of health and resistance to parasites, and are hard to fake,"" writes Hoggenboom at BBC Earth.', 'Animals don’t just show off for attention. The ways they show off are usually honest signals of their quality. Female birds tend to like males with the brightest colors, longest feathers, and the most complicated songs. But, only the healthiest males put on a good show. A male bird’s color and brain development depends on his health. A good performance shows that the male is good at getting food, is strong, or is good at not getting sick – all traits that a female would want her offspring to have too.', 'Other animals also have creative ways of getting their crushes to notice them. Using crazy features, bright colors, shows of strength, rhythmic sounds, and special smells, they go all out to impress future mates. Humans have complex social behaviors, and females might show off as much as males do. But in most animals, males are usually the showy ones.', 'MR: Animal sexual beauty is often characterized by being extreme: long tails, complex songs, brilliant colors, and outrageous dances. The same is often true of sexual beauty in humans. Female supermodels, for example, tend to be much longer and thinner than most other women in the population, male supermodels are super-buff—hardly normal. Furthermore, in animals we can create sexual traits that are more extreme than what exists in males of the population, and in experiments females often prefer these artificially exaggerated traits, such as: even longer tales, more complex songs, and more brilliant colors than exhibited by their own males. These are called supernormal stimuli. Pornography also creates supernormal stimuli not only in showcasing individuals with extreme traits but also in creating social settings that hardly exist in most societies, this manufactured social setting is sometimes referred to as Pornotopia.']"
Why do we like the aroma of herbs/spices in foods?,"We like the aroma of herbs/spices in foods because they enhance the flavor, aroma, and color of food & beverages. They also have amazing nutritional qualities that contribute to human health, such as antioxidant properties and reducing the risk of civilizational diseases[2][4]. Furthermore, they reduce the amount of fat, salt and sugar in our cooking thanks to the intensity of their aromas and flavors[2]. Herbs and spices also produce molecules which attract pollinators or drive away herbivorous animals[3], which is why they are grown and spread worldwide. Finally, some plants can be used as both an herb and a spice, such as dill[5].","['- The regular use of culinary herbs and spices goes far beyond the simple search for taste pleasure, because introducing them into our eating habits, allows us to acquire healthy eating habits and participates in the nutritional prevention of non-communicable diseases with a nutritional component.', 'Used for pleasure, spices and culinary herbs provided by our environment also have amazing nutritional qualities that contribute to human health. Their fragrant and strong-tasting compounds often participate in the defence of the plant that produces them against environmental damage. Ingested in our food, they largely keep their bioactive properties: for example, they have antioxidant properties useful to our health. They reduce the risk of so-called civilizational diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and, as very recently demonstrated, they promote the growth of the “good” bacteria of our microbiota. In addition, spices reduce the amount of fat, salt and sugar in our cooking thanks to the intensity of their aromas and flavours.', 'The constituents of spices which are important from a flavouring property perspective are essentially secondary metabolism products and hence not vital for the growth of plant. In some cases the flavourful aroma molecules are by-products of metabolism and play a role in attracting pollinators or drive away herbivorous animals. It is paradoxical that some herbs and plants are grown and spread world-wide for enhancing the taste of food is intended to discourage the consumption of the plant.', 'Over the last few decades successful research has proven the strong antioxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and immune modulatory properties of herbs & spices. Furthermore, their flavouring & aromatic properties contribute to a reduction in salt consumption, thus leading to cardiovascular health benefits. Today we know that spices not only enhance the flavour, aroma, and colour of food & beverages, but they can also protect people from acute and chronic diseases. Even though in terms of weight, spices and herbs contribute little to the dinner plate, nonetheless, they are important contributors to antioxidant intake.', 'Herbs and spices are used as flavorings. Herbs refer to the large group of aromatic plants whose leaves, stems or flowers are used to acid flavors to other foods. Most herbs are available fresh or dried. Because drying alters their flavors and aromas, fresh herbs are generally preferred and should be used if possible. Spices are strongly flavored or aromatic portions of plants used as flavorings, condiments or aromatics. Spices are the bark, roots, seeds, buds or berries of plants, most of which grow naturally only in tropical climates. Spices are usually used in their dried form, rarely fresh, and can usually be purchased whole or ground. Some plants- dill, for example- can be used as both an herb (its leaves) and a spice (its seeds).']"
"why are we ""better"" (or no better) than other animals?",Humans are not inherently better or more important than other animals[2][3][4].

This might be our most uniquely human ability.[5],"['We humans tend to think of ourselves as better than, or at least separate from, all other species on this planet.

We may be more important to ourselves, but that doesn’t justify our treating animals as if they’re less important to us, any more than the fact that your family is more important to you justifies you treating other people’s families as if they are less important than yours.', 'In her new book, “Fellow Creatures: Our Obligations to the Other Animals,” Arthur Kingsley Porter Professor of Philosophy Christine Korsgaard makes the case that humans are not inherently more important than animals and therefore should treat them much better than we do.', '“Some people think that humans are just plain more important than other animals.

Are Liberals over exaggerating climate change for personal gain or are Conservatives undermining the topic for personal gain?,"Both liberals and conservatives have been accused of exaggerating and undermining the issue of climate change for personal gain. Liberals have been accused of exaggerating the effects of climate change and using it as a tool to push for drastic and immediate action, while conservatives have been accused of plugging their ears to the available facts and calling it ""the greatest hoax""[1]. However, it is important to note that there are differences in the way both sides view the potential harms of climate change, with liberal Democrats more likely to believe that it will bring more droughts, storms that are more severe, harm to animals and to plant life, and damage to shorelines from rising sea levels[5].","['The truth is that the most authoritative, mainstream scientific predictions envision some serious, undesirable changes, but hardly the dystopia of Gore\'s imagination. Yet, as liberals have yelled that the sky is falling, conservatives have plugged their own ears not only to ludicrous exaggerations, but also to the available facts. Liberal alarmism could be countered with arguments and with constructive policy alternatives to the administrative power grabs that the left prefers. Instead, for years those conservatives with access to the biggest megaphones have announced that the science underlying global warming is somewhere between highly speculative and ""the greatest hoax,"" to quote from the title of a book on the subject by Senator James Inhofe, a Republican with significant influence on climate matters.', 'Appealing to the driving political psychology and ideology of both liberals and conservatives, highlighting common values, undermining stereotypes and being inclusive of intellectual difference are all ingredients to break down polarization and make climate change a persistent issue for both liberals and conservatives.', 'The only consolation for the Liberals is that talking about climate reduces the Conservatives to a state of mortification, swiftly followed by tortuous use of alliteration to attack Trudeau’s jet-set lifestyle (“high carbon hypocrisy,” etc.).', '-   -   -   -   - The political debate over climate change has long resembled a contest to see which party can discredit itself more.

""Our food systems, our cities, our people and our very way of life developed within a stable range of climatic conditions on Earth,"" Gore has written. ""Without immediate and decisive action, these favorable conditions on Earth could become a memory if we continue to make the climate crisis worse day after day after day.""', 'The stakes in climate debates seem particularly high to liberal Democrats because they are especially likely to believe that climate change will bring harms to the environment.

Do animals experience the same emotions of “cute” as humans do?,"Research suggests that animals experience the same emotions of “cute” as humans do. Studies have shown that we typically feel affection for animals with juvenile features, such as big eyes, bulging craniums and recessed chins[2]. When we see something cute, it ignites brain activity in regions associated with emotion and pleasure, and it triggers empathy and compassion[3]. There is also a phenomenon called “cute aggression” where people get the urge to squeeze or bite cute things[4]. This phenomenon is an example of dimorphous expression of emotions, which is when someone experiences a strong emotion of one type but expresses the opposite emotion.[5]","['N200: A significant effect of “cuteness” was observed for animals such that a larger N200 was elicited after more versus less cute animals. A significant correlation between N200 amplitude and the tendency to express positive emotions in a dimorphous manner (e.g., crying when happy) was observed.', 'This nurturing instinct could even be driving our wider perception of cuteness – research has shown that we typically feel affection for animals with juvenile features. Dogs, for instance, have been bred to have similar features to babies, with big eyes, bulging craniums and recessed chins. They are also soft to touch. Whether we want it or not, we may also feel a certain affection for adults and even inanimate objects with infant-like features such as dolls, teddies and even miniature products.', 'Cuteness may help to facilitate well-being and complex social relationships by activating brain networks associated with emotion and pleasure and triggering empathy and compassion. When we encounter something cute, it ignites fast brain activity in regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex, which are linked to emotion and pleasure. It also attracts our attention in a biased way: babies have privileged access to entering conscious awareness in our brains.', 'The urge people get to squeeze or bite cute things, albeit without desire to cause harm, is known as “cute aggression.” Using electrophysiology (ERP), we measured components related to emotional salience and reward processing. Participants aged 18–40 years (n = 54) saw four sets of images: cute babies, less cute babies, cute (baby) animals, and less cute (adult) animals. On measures of cute aggression, feeling overwhelmed by positive emotions, approachability, appraisal of cuteness, and feelings of caretaking, participants rated more cute animals significantly higher than less cute animals. There were significant correlations between participants’ self-report of behaviors related to cute aggression and ratings of cute aggression in the current study.', 'Cute aggression has been discussed as an example of dimorphous expression of emotions. Dimorphous expression refers to someone experiencing a strong emotion of one type (e.g., happy or sad) but expressing the opposite emotion. For example, some people report laughing when they are sad, or crying when they are happy. Typically, expressions of emotions are broad, such as smiling when happy or frowning when sad (Aragón, 2017; Aragón and Bargh, 2018). However, the emotions we express to very cute stimuli are complex overlapping emotions that communicate one category of emotion (Aragón, 2016). Most of the feelings for cute aggression can be viewed as contradictory, such as in the event of receiving a new puppy and simultaneously crying and smiling.']"
Why did humans evolve to be so much slower than other meat-eating mammals?,"It is likely that early humans evolved to be slower than other meat-eating mammals in order to better consume animal-sourced food[5]. This would have been an advantage for early humans as they were spreading out across the world[1]. Additionally, the increased consumption of animal-sourced food likely selected for ""meat-adaptive genes"" to increase resistance to toxins and pathogens[4]. Also, being able to walk on two legs was important for early humans as it was more efficient than knuckle walking and allowed them to search for meat over longer distances[5].","['This would have been a big advantage to early humans as they were spreading out across Africa and into Asia just under two million years ago, encountering unfamiliar habitats, novel carnivore competitors, and different prey animals. Yet our large brains come at a cost, making childbirth more difficult and painful for human mothers than for our nearest evolutionary kin. Modern human brains take up only about 2 percent of our body weight as adults, but use about 20 percent of our energy. Such a disproportionate use of resources calls for investigation. For years, my colleagues and I have explored the idea that meat-eating may have played a role in this unusual aspect of human biology.', 'For Barr, the new study’s results point to a gap in the paleontological record that needs to be filled in. It might be that other factors were responsible for the evolution of humanlike traits, or it might be that there was a big increase in meat-eating in an earlier period that we just haven’t been able to see yet. “At some point there is no evidence for butchery, and at some point there’s a lot of evidence. And something had to happen in between,” says Jessica Thompson, an anthropologist at Yale University.', 'It’s likely that meat eating “made it possible for humans to evolve a larger brain size,” said Aiello. Early human ancestors probably consumed more animal foods — termites and small mammals – than the 2 percent of carnivorous caloric intake associated with chimpanzees.', 'Some scientists hypothesize that the increased consumption of animal-sourced food during human evolution selected for “meat-adaptive genes”, in order to increase resistance to harmful effects of fat, toxins, and pathogens, and to delay dysfunctions in the brain and heart, that are associated with consuming increasing. These genes may also enable a major increase in lifespan, which could partly explain the difference in life expectancy between humans and other great apes. Meat-adaptive genes enabled the shift from herbivorous to omnivorous diets. However, this is currently just a hypothesis, and requires further research to be verified.', 'Interestingly, while these proto-humans chose to profit from the new wealth of savannah herbivores and their flesh, the ancestors of chimps and gorillas never did. One of the reasons might have been their inability to walk on two legs. Searching for meat is costly, requiring more long-distance walking—and, in turn, more energy—than eating grass or fruit. Moving on two legs is more energy efficient than chimp- or gorilla-style knuckle walking, and longer legs better dissipate temperature, which prevents overheating and boosts endurance. It seems that if Sahelanthropus or its ancestors didn’t stand up straight (or at least straight-ish) 6 million years ago, early Homo wouldn’t have been so well equipped to search for meat a few million years down the road, and might not have developed a taste for animal flesh—and there might not now be steaks or burgers on the dinner tables of today.']"
"Why do mental health professionals consider it okay to take mood altering prescription medications, but not okay to smoke weed to alleviate depression and anxiety?","Mental health professionals consider it okay to take mood altering prescription medications, but not okay to smoke weed to alleviate depression and anxiety because marijuana use carries unique risks for those ""self-medicating"" and can make depression worse when used as an ersatz antidepressant[2].

Short and long term changes in mood, depression, and suicidality can begin during adolescence and exacerbate by teen marijuana use according to a recent study.4 This longitudinal cohort study of over 30 years found that cannabis use during adolescence is not a medicine, but is associated with both depression and suicidality in adult life. Early use is the riskiest. The younger the user of regular cannabis, the higher the risk of depression in adulthood.

Why do things that are bad for you taste nice?,"Things that are bad for us can taste nice because of evolutionary reasons[4]. Ancient humans had an abundance of plants around them, so their body didn’t need to develop a mechanism which would spur them to eat more plants. What humans really did require, and what was then in short supply, was sodium[4]. Salt makes food taste better because it triggers serotonin[4].

Our brains send signals that make us want what is generally bad for our health[4][5].","['As for other healthier things tasting bad, I think it isn\'t that they taste bad, it\'s that sugar tastes a lot better. We are programmed to want sugar, and things with low sugar content don\'t satisfy this desire, so our brain says ""this is nasty, go find something with more sugar."" Since we have created things with immense amounts of sugar I would imagine this effect is even more pronounced now.', ""Now, we put salt and sugar in everything because we are drawn to it. It's no longer rare. We make bad food taste good by tricking our taste buds into thinking it was that rare treat it used to be.

Yet it is simply too much, and inflicts irreparable harm on our body.', 'Since we now know the scientific reason behind craving unhealthy food, it makes sense why healthy choices taste bad to us.

Why do cats feel like they're entitled to everything?,"Cats may feel like they are entitled to everything because their human companions tend to fulfill their every whim and request[2]. Cats may also feel entitled because of their natural feline instincts, which can lead to behaviors that humans find annoying, such as jumping on the table or counters, scratching furniture, or attacking feet when they walk by[5]. Additionally, cats may have a sense of entitlement due to the belief that they are in charge of their human's lives[2]. This is supported by the rights-based line of reasoning that suggests cats are entitled to the basic conditions of a good life, and that their human companions should consider their duties to their feline neighbors[1].","['One approach is a rights-based line of reasoning; it would urge you to ensure that you’re not denying the cats of the neighborhood the basic conditions of a good life to which they’re entitled.

"Computer, phone, etc. batteries lose longevitiy when a charger is connected for extended periods of time while already at 100 percent charge","Connecting a charger to a device for an extended period of time while the battery is already at 100 percent can cause the battery to lose its longevity.

It is also recommended to not fully charge or discharge your device’s battery, but rather charge it to around 50 percent[4]. This is because if a device is stored with a fully discharged battery, it can fall into a deep discharge state, and if it is stored with a fully charged battery, it could lose some capacity[4].

why alcohol can have commercials and not tobacco,"Alcohol companies are not exempt from advertising, however, they do have some restrictions in place, such as not showing anyone drinking beer in an advertisement[1]. While research has found that the influence of tobacco and alcohol advertising on teens are analogous[2], alcohol advertisements appeal to the risk-taking behavior that is often present among adolescents and young adults[3]. This is in contrast to tobacco advertisements, which were largely prevalent before the federal restrictions on tobacco advertisement and were specifically targeted to youth-oriented television shows and magazines with high youth readership[5]. Therefore, alcohol can have commercials, but tobacco is restricted from having them.[1]","[""Because alcohol companies haven't faced the scrutiny that tobacco companies did, they are not exempt from advertising. That does not mean that alcohol companies do not have their own restrictions. Whilst they do not have a settlement agreement or laws restricting them (at least to the same capacity as cigarettes), there is a self-regulatory body that governs the advertisements of alcohol in the US. Take for instance the fact that you never see anyone drink beer in a beer commercial. That's not due to law, that's due to a conscious choice not to, to avoid certain possible lawsuits. Kind of weird, I know, but that's just how it is."", 'They found that, in every aspect studied, the influence of tobacco and alcohol advertising on teens were analogous. For instance, both tobacco and alcohol companies have used mascots in advertisements (e.g., Joe Camel, the Budweiser frogs), which research shows are easily recognized and trusted by children. In addition, both tobacco and alcohol companies use or have used movies, television, and sporting events as opportunities for advertising and product placement, with studies showing that exposure to smoking and drinking increases the risk for youth initiation.', 'To appeal to youth aspirations, alcohol advertising likewise relies heavily on a number of themes and types of images that are virtually identical to those used by the tobacco industry, including high energy, sexuality, popularity, attractiveness, fame, humor, friendship, and sociability (Aitken et al., 1988; Grube, 1993; Madden & Grube, 1994; Morgenstern et al., 2015). Alcohol advertisements associate drinking with adventurous and potentially hazardous activities, such as driving, swimming, or boating (Grube, 1993), thus appealing to the risk-taking behavior that is so often present among adolescents and young adults. Even if actual consumption is not shown, viewers interpret the advertisements to imply that drinking is associated with the activity (Atkin & Block, 1970).', 'If advertising helped create a culture of smoking, and if banning tobacco ads from TV helped dampen that culture, then can’t the same be possible for the advertising of alcoholic beverages?', 'Before the federal restrictions on tobacco advertisement, cigarettes advertisements were widely prevalent during youth-oriented television shows. Magazines with high youth readership still have a particularly high volume of tobacco advertisements, as well as alcohol advertisements (Alpert et al., 2008; King et al., 1998; Ross et al., 2014c). Alcohol advertisements still are frequently featured during youth-oriented shows and sports programming, such that the top 15 youth-oriented television programs all contain alcohol advertisements.

is there a reason that not all animals in colder climates go into hibernation?,"Not all animals in colder climates go into hibernation for a variety of reasons. Firstly, hibernation requires the animal to have a reduced metabolism, slower heart rate, and lowered body temperature[1], so it is not practical for larger animals to enter deep, multiday torpor[2]. Secondly, smaller animals have a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio, meaning that they are more susceptible to losing heat from their skin[2]. Thirdly, hibernation is a response to cold weather and reduced food availability[1][2][3][5], so animals go into hibernation when faced with a lack of food[1][5], not necessarily due to the cold temperatures[4][5].","['Winter has two big problems for animals. There’s less food and it is intensely cold. These environmental stressors cause a wide variety of animals to go into a state of dormancy. While hibernation is often used to describe any animal that goes into dormancy in the winter, there are three very specific requirements for an animal to be considered a true hibernator: reduced metabolism, slower heart rate, and lowered body temperature.', 'Bears are not ‘typical’ hibernators in another way—they’re big. It’s small animals, like hedgehogs, bats, hamsters and squirrels who tend to be hibernators, for a number of reasons. Firstly, because warming up from hibernation would take bigger animals longer, and use a lot of energy, it’s not practical for them to enter deep, multiday torpor. Secondly, hibernation is one of the only survival strategies available to tiny creatures who are unable to migrate to escape deadly weather or to find an alternative source of food. And thirdly, smaller animals have a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio, meaning that they are more susceptible to losing heat from their skin. If you’ve ever stopped to wonder why little creatures curl up into a ball over winter, here’s your answer. No, it’s not to maximise their cuteness factor, it’s to reduce their surface area, thereby minimising heat loss.', 'Hibernation is a response to cold weather and reduced food availability. Most animals that hibernate are quite small and, as the weather gets colder, they reach the point where they simply can’t eat enough food to sustain their body temperature.', 'Hibernation is a hypothermic condition when animals save energy during cold seasons by lowering body temperature, metabolism, breathing, and heart rate. This makes it possible for an animal to survive the winter on a fat deposit that would otherwise not last the winter. Animals usually hibernate in a protected, well-insulated site.', 'For a long time, it was thought that seasonal changes in temperature were the main reason for hibernation. However, it has since been proven that food is the main driver for hibernation. From the dry season in the tropics to the winter months in the arctic, organisms hibernate when faced with a lack of food. That being said, organisms in your local Westchester region recognize that during the cold months, food availability will be low, and naturally will begin hibernation processes when colder temperatures creep in.']"
deliberate homelessness - just why?,"People may become deliberately homeless for various reasons, such as if they have been evicted from their home due to something they or their partner did or failed to do, or if their homelessness is caused by something they deliberately did or failed to do[1][4]. Deliberate homelessness is often the only way for people to get council housing[2], and local authorities must consider the reasons someone became homeless when determining if they are intentionally homeless[5]. The administration of housing benefit in local authorities needs to be tackled in order to prevent homelessness[3].","['Being ‘intentionally homeless’ means that your homelessness, or threatened homelessness, was caused by something that you deliberately did or failed to do.', 'Rosie Brocklehurst (Letters, December 1) asks ""who invented the word \'intentionality\'?"" in the context of homelessness legislation. Does she suppose council housing that is not offered to the ""intentionally homeless"" goes to undeserving families? The reality is that the homelessness legislation, introduced after Cathy Come Home, and meant just to fill a loophole alongside normal needs-based allocation, is now often the only way to get council housing. Once those accepted as unintentionally homeless are housed there is almost nothing left for those who aren\'t legally homeless.', ""If the government is serious about preventing homelessness it must tackle the administration of housing benefit in local authorities and end the system of hoops through which homeless families must jump to be rehoused.

Why is food (and other things) preserved when it is frozen?,"Freezing food preserves it by slowing down decomposition and inhibiting the growth of bacteria[1]. It also helps to retain the quality, texture, and nutritional value of food[1]. The freezing process is a combination of the beneficial effects of low temperatures, at which microorganisms cannot grow, chemical reactions are reduced, and cellular metabolic reactions are delayed[3]. Protection of the food to be frozen is also an important factor, and can be done by freezing in airtight containers, airtight bags, or under vacuum[4]. To preserve food in the best conditions, the freezing process must be followed correctly[5].","['Freezing food preserves it from the time it is prepared to the time it is eaten. Since early times, farmers, fishermen, and trappers have preserved grains and produce in unheated buildings during the winter season. Freezing food slows decomposition by turning residual moisture into ice, inhibiting the growth of most bacterial species. In the food commodity industry, there are two processes: mechanical and cryogenic (or flash freezing). The freezing kinetics is important to preserve the food quality and texture. Quicker freezing generates smaller ice crystals and maintains cellular structure. Cryogenic freezing is the quickest freezing technology available due to the ultra low liquid nitrogen temperature −196 °C (−320 °F).', 'Freezing preservation retains the quality of agricultural products over long storage periods. As a method of long-term preservation for fruits and vegetables, freezing is generally regarded as superior to canning and dehydration, with respect to retention in sensory attributes and nutritive properties (Fennema, 1977). The safety and nutrition quality of frozen products are emphasized when high quality raw materials are used, good manufacturing practices are employed in the preservation process, and the products are kept in accordance with specified temperatures.', 'Freezing is one of the oldest and most widely used methods of food preservation, which allows preservation of taste, texture, and nutritional value in foods better than any other method. The freezing process is a combination of the beneficial effects of low temperatures at which microorganisms cannot grow, chemical reactions are reduced, and cellular metabolic reactions are delayed (Delgado and Sun, 2000).', 'Protection of the food to be frozen is also an important factor. Freezing in airtight containers, airtight bags or freezing the food under vacuum can greatly help preservation.', 'To preserve food in the best conditions, the freezing process must be followed correctly, as a bad freezing method chosen for an unsuitable product can damage its conditions and even the whole preservation process, leading to the deterioration of the food.']"

"Why is my polystyrene coffee cup cool to hold, but other cups tend to be hot?","Polystyrene is a material commonly used in coffee and tea cups.

"other than snakes, why do almost all land vertebrates have 4 limbs?","The loss of limbs in land vertebrates is largely attributed to their fossorial (living in tunnels or burrows) lifestyle[1]. It seems that many vertebrates have the capacity to evolve into legless forms, as evidenced by snakes and lizards[1][2]. All these animals are considered tetrapods, which means they descended from a common ancestor who had four feet[3]. Additionally, the loss of limbs has led to the evolution of some of the most bizarre terrestrial vertebrates, such as the amphisbaenids[1][4]. The discovery of fossils dating back to more than 308 million years ago reveals that land vertebrates began to evolve a snake-like form less than 100 million years after the first vertebrates grew legs[5].","['Limbs are such endlessly useful appendages that it seems odd that so many terrestrial vertebrates should have lost them. More than any other vertebrates it seems the reptiles have gone out of their way to eschew limbs – just consider the diversity of snakes as a testament to how successful this legless way of life is. These limbless reptiles, indeed all limbless vertebrates have one thing in common: they are or they have evolved from fossorial animals. A fossorial existence is one way of life where limbs are nothing more than a hindrance and in many of the vertebrates that turned their back on the sky for a life underground evolution has gradually reduced these structures to mere vestiges of their former, multi-functional glory.', 'The fact that the molgophids evolved to lose at least some limbs is an important discovery, he says, because it shows that this ability is present in most vertebrates with legs. Apart from snakes and some lizards, the only vertebrates without legs are amphibians including salamanders and caecilians. But it seems that other groups, such as mammals and birds, may have the capacity to evolve into legless forms – unless they have lost the associated genes, he says.', 'The word “tetrapod” means “four feet” and includes all species alive today that have four feet — but this group also includes many animals that don’t have four feet. That’s because the group includes all the organisms (living and extinct) that descended from the last common ancestor of amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. So, for example, the ichthyosaur, an extinct swimming reptile, is a tetrapod even though it did not use its limbs to walk on land. So is the snake, even though it has no limbs. And birds and humans are tetrapods even though they only walk on two legs. All these animals are tetrapods because they descend from the tetrapod ancestor described above, even if they have secondarily lost their “four feet.”', 'As well as being quite common, the loss of limbs has also spawned some of the most bizarre terrestrial vertebrates, with my personal favourites being the amphisbaenids. Commonly known as worm lizards these very peculiar animals are, unsurprisingly, best described as worm-like lizards, but their exact evolutionary relationships to the other lizards is something of a mystery.', 'Less than 100 million years after vertebrates first grew legs, some of their descendants had evolved to lose them again, fossils reveal. The discovery shows that land vertebrates first began to evolve a snake-like form at least 308 million years ago.']"
"how birds can carry messages ti random places, as in Game of Thrones","Ravens are most commonly used to carry messages in Game of Thrones because they are larger and more clever than doves and pigeons[1]. They have the physical strength to fly longer distances and the intellectual capacity to remember the longer path they must take, and are better able to fend off attacks from larger birds of prey[1]. Through complex training methods, maesters are able to send messages from almost any castle in the realm to any other[3]. Homing pigeons have also been used historically to carry messages over long distances, and are famous for their involvement in war[5].","[""King Baelor I Targaryen, in one of his pious delusions, tried to replace all the realm's messenger ravens with doves (a symbol of purity), but this was unsuccessful. Maester Aemon says at one point that while doves and pigeons can both be trained to carry messages, the maesters don't use doves because ravens are larger and more clever: They have the physical strength to fly longer distances as well as the intellectual capacity to accurately remember the longer path they must take; they are also able to fend off attacks from larger birds of prey - such as hawks - much better than smaller doves or pigeons can."", 'According to Tybald, the maester of the Dreadfort, only a small handful of ravens are intelligent enough to be trained as message carriers, and as such are greatly prized. Even more rarely found are ravens who are so intelligent that they can be trained to fly between multiple locations; a bird who is capable of travelling between four or even five castles occurs only once a century.', 'Compared to other birds, ravens are uncommonly intelligent, and are used by the maesters to send messages between the castles and cities of the Seven Kingdoms. Ravens can fly great distances at speed, and through complex training methods, the maesters are able to send messages from almost any castle in the realm to any other.', ""Much of the wheeling and dealing that keeps the political cogs turning in George R. R. Martin's World of Ice and Fire series is facilitated in some part by the clever messenger ravens that cover great distances to deliver clandestine missives throughout the seven kingdoms. Without messenger ravens, there would be no nefarious plots and creepy arranged marriages in Game of Thrones, which actually puts the whole story at odds with science, as the latest episode of AsapSCIENCE discusses."", 'But, though the land over which those ravens have flown is one of fantasy, there’s a real historical basis to the idea of message-carrying birds. Homing pigeons have a storied history dating back far beyond the Middle Ages, the period from which Thrones author George R.R. Martin frequently draws inspiration. (Pigeons aren’t the only birds with special abilities — corvids like ravens are thought to be particularly smart — but they are the most famous for this particular purpose.) And many of history’s most famous homing pigeons — including one that saved nearly 200 soldiers in World War I — have earned their celebrity through their involvement in war.']"
Why does it seem like the former Axis members are well known for their cars?,"The former Axis members are well known for their cars because of the Nazi regime's aim to promote a “People’s Car” (Volkswagen) for the German public[1].

Additionally, the German General Automobile Club ADAC (Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil-Club e.V., or ADAC) expelled Jewish members in 1933 and Jews were deprived of the right to drive automobiles after Kristallnacht in 1938[3]. Furthermore, automobile companies continued to make cars and trucks for the government while dramatically broadening their output to include military weapons such as tanks, engines, cannons, trucks, and aircraft[4].

What is the evolutionary advantage that would cause species to develop psychoactive properties? Or are those properties just incidental to other advantages?,"The evolutionary advantage that would cause species to develop psychoactive properties is the potential for increased fitness due to consumption of psychoactive plants containing compounds that chemically resemble endogenous signaling molecules[1]. These compounds may provide a ""treatment"" for deficiencies in dietary precursors in marginal environments[1], and their consumption may provide salutogenic, socially expanding, and cognitive enhancing effects[1]. In addition, the instrumentalization of these compounds may enhance performance in competence domains such as cognition, sociality, communication, and social learning, potentially increasing the adaptability and fitness of our ancestors[5].","['From a homeostatic perspective, increased fitness can potentially result from consumption of psychoactive plants containing compounds that chemically resemble endogenous signaling molecules, especially when internal signaling functions are compromised [e.g., due to deficiencies in dietary precursors in marginal environments (Sullivan and Hagen, 2015)]. Our proposal is that the incidental ingestion of psilocybin and other psychedelic secondary metabolites that have very low toxicity and structurally resemble the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) provided a “treatment” for 5-HT depletion, a costly challenge likely recurring throughout advancement into a socio-cognitive niche (see e.g., Young and Leyton, 2002; Wood et al., 2006).

What happens the calorie energy when food spoils/goes bad?,"When food spoils/goes bad, the calorie energy is not used by the body. The energy stored in the chemical bonds of the food molecules is not accessible to the body, since the digestive enzymes in the mouth, stomach and intestines are unable to break them down into simpler structures[2]. This means that the calories contained in the food are not absorbed and are essentially wasted, as they do not provide any nutritional value[1]. The calories in food provide potential energy, but the substance from which the calories are taken is also important[3]. Without energy from food, the body cannot function properly, as the cells, heart, lungs, and organs require energy in order to carry out basic processes[5].","['By reducing the number of calories you consume, you are training your body that you are undergoing an energy shortage (food is scarce). Your body responds by using less energy (converting fat into useable fuel) and metabolism slows down. Thus, the energy you do have (stored as fat) is not used, and is slowly burned off just to maintain bodily function. Essentially, your body “thinks” there is a famine and rations all resources. This goes without saying, but if you do not meet basic biological caloric requirements, you will have a host of other problems including: increased appetite, low energy, poor concentration and the risk of dying from hunger.', 'Food is energy for the body. Digestive enzymes in the mouth, stomach and intestines break up complex food molecules into simpler structures, such as sugars and amino acids that travel through the bloodstream to all our tissues. Our cells use the energy stored in the chemical bonds of these simpler molecules to carry on business as usual. We calculate the available energy in all foods with a unit known as the food calorie, or kilocalorie—the amount of energy required to heat one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius. Fats provide approximately nine calories per gram, whereas carbohydrates and proteins deliver just four. Fiber offers a piddling two calories because enzymes in the human digestive tract have great difficulty chopping it up into smaller molecules.', 'The number of calories in food tells us how much potential energy they contain. It is not only calories that are important, but also the substance from which the calories are taken.', 'Empty calories are those that provide energy but very little nutritional value. The parts of food that provide empty calories contain virtually no dietary fiber, amino acids, antioxidants, dietary minerals, or vitamins.', 'The human body needs calories to survive. Without energy, the cells in the body would die, the heart and lungs would stop, and the organs would not be able to carry out the basic processes needed for living.

Why do we have to sanitize our drinking water when other animals don't have to?,"We have to sanitize our drinking water because it can be contaminated by a wide variety of disease-causing microbial agents including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and worms[4], which can overwhelm the human immune system. Open sources of water are often shared with animals and contaminated with waterborne diseases like cholera[3][4]. Even water from seemingly clean sources like lakes and wells can be contaminated with germs that make people sick[5]. To prevent contamination, water companies add a disinfectant like chlorine or chloramine which kills germs and make the water safe for drinking[5].","['Never drink water from a natural source that you haven’t purified, even if the water looks clean. Water in a stream, river or lake may look clean, but it can still be filled with bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can result in waterborne diseases, such as cryptosporidiosis or giardiasis. It is essential that you purify natural water. Purifying water involves filtering to remove large particles and treating by boiling or with chemicals to kill organisms such as bacteria, viruses and parasites.', 'Water is the nutrient of highest importance, making contaminated water a serious threat to animals and profits. Frequent cleaning and monitoring of the drinking system is necessary to maintain a good quality drinking water. Microbial quality of the water is determined by living organisms in the drinking water. Although tap, bottled or source water may contain a low count of bacteria, a polluted drinking line system can still cause high bacterial pressure at the drinking nipples. Pathogenic bacteria are very capable of transferring an infection to animals via drinking water. To be short; attention to microbial water quality should be focused wider than the source water alone; the drinking line system should also be clean.', 'Open sources of water usually aren’t safe. They’re often shared with animals, and contaminated with waterborne diseases like cholera.', 'FALSE. Water can be contaminated by a wide variety of disease-causing microbial agents including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and worms. While the human body can become resistant to some of these agents, many of them will overwhelm anyone’s immune system. Whether you live in the United States, Argentina, Nairobi, or Cape Town, you’re susceptible. Just 100 years ago before the advent of water treatment systems, outbreaks of cholera, typhoid fever, and other serious waterborne diseases regularly occurred throughout North America and Europe. This made hundreds of thousands of people, sick and sometimes killed tens of thousands of people. Children are even more vulnerable. Unfortunately, regular exposure to dirty water did nothing to prevent the spread of these deadly diseases. Parasites and diarrheal diseases rob young bodies of important nutrients and impede physical and cognitive development with effects that last a lifetime.', 'Water comes from a variety of sources, such as lakes and wells, which can be contaminated with germs that may make people sick. Germs can also contaminate water as it travels through miles of piping to get to a community.

Where does the pillow industry get all those feathers from?,"The pillow industry gets feathers from a variety of sources. Most commonly, feathers are a by-product of the meat production industry and are collected from birds that have been slaughtered for their meat. However, feathers are also sometimes plucked from living birds, although this is an illegal and unethical practise in many countries[3]. In addition, feathers are sometimes collected from hunters and processed using picking machines, which pluck the feathers, and then move on to the feather room and gutting tables to finish processing the birds[5]. Finally, the feathers are vacuumed into pillows and sewn shut for shipping[3][5].","['Obviously it is birds, but I mean how does that work?

Please explain how we are not past the tipping point for climate change?,"We are not past the tipping point for climate change because a tipping point is defined as a ""critical threshold beyond which a system reorganizes, often abruptly and/or irreversibly"" (Refrence [1][4]). Tipping points are possible at today's global warming of just over 1 °C (1.8 °F) above preindustrial times, and highly probable above 2 °C (3.6 °F) of global warming (Refrence [5]). It is possible that some tipping points are close to being crossed or have already been crossed, like those of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, the Amazon rainforest and warm-water coral reefs (Refrence [5]). Crossing the tipping point of one system could cause a cascade of other tipping points, leading to severe impacts (Refrence [5]). This could lead to irreversible changes in the climate system, which could take many decades or centuries (Refrence [1]).","['The sixth report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released in 2021, defines a tipping point as a ""critical threshold beyond which a system reorganizes, often abruptly and/or irreversibly"". It can be brought about by a small disturbance causing a disproportionately large change in the system. It can also be associated with self-reinforcing feedbacks, which could lead to changes in the climate system irreversible on a human timescale. For any particular climate component, the shift from one state to a new stable state may take many decades or centuries. In ecosystems and in social systems, a tipping point can trigger a regime shift, a major systems reorganisation into a new stable state.', 'The analysis, published in the journal Science, assessed more than 200 previous studies on past tipping points, climate observations and modelling studies. A tipping point is when a temperature threshold is passed, leading to unstoppable change in a climate system, even if global heating ends.', 'The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines tipping points as “critical thresholds in a system that, when exceeded, can lead to a significant change in the state of the system, often with an understanding that the change is irreversible.”', 'The 2019 IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate defines a tipping point as: ""A level of change in system properties beyond which a system reorganises, often in a non-linear manner, and does not return to the initial state even if the drivers of the change are abated. For the climate system, the term refers to a critical threshold at which global or regional climate changes from one stable state to another stable state."".', ""Tipping points are possible at today's global warming of just over 1 °C (1.8 °F) above preindustrial times, and highly probable above 2 °C (3.6 °F) of global warming. The geological record shows many abrupt changes that suggest tipping points may have been crossed in ancient times. It is possible that some tipping points are close to being crossed or have already been crossed, like those of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, the Amazon rainforest and warm-water coral reefs. A danger is that if the tipping point in one system is crossed, this could cause a cascade of other tipping points, leading to severe impacts.""]"
Why does milk in the US taste different than milk in Canada?,"American milk tastes different than Canadian milk due to differences in standards and regulation between the two countries' dairy industries. The cows in the US have different diets, which can greatly affect the taste of the dairy products[1]. Additionally, American milk contains more white blood cells than milk that comes from cows in Canada[5], which could affect the taste.[1]","['The differences in milk and cheese, even within Canada, have been explained to me by the diet of the cows.

While consumers will not become ill after drinking Amrican milk, it may pose health risks.', 'TL;DR American dairy producers are subject to lesser standards than their Canadian counterparts.

How did freshwater fish species end up across thousands of non-connected lakes across huge regions and sometimes over multiple continents?,"Freshwater fish tend to disperse well, so they can colonize many different lakes throughout a large basin by moving through and between river systems downstream or upstream to lakes[1]. There are two general explanations for how a fish species might end up in different lakes separated by hundreds of miles[2]. One is that a lake may have once been connected by a land bridge, or a river may have flooded to create a populated lake[3]. Another is that humans often deliberately introduce fish to lakes and ponds[3][4]. Additionally, humans have been dispersing fish great distances intentionally to be able to fish for a particular species outside of that species's native range[4].","['Freshwater fish tend to disperse well—as illustrated by the many different species that now occupy the high latitudes of North America, most of which were covered by ice during the last glaciation. Fish have recolonized all of the present-day rivers and lakes that were under ice during that period. Although we often tend to think of fish in lakes as lake dwellers, many of these species use rivers during parts of their life cycles. For example, Yellowstone cutthroat trout occupy a number of lakes throughout their range, but use rivers for spawning. Some of the young fish then move back to the lake to mature, whereas others remain in the rivers. One can imagine that over time, fish moving through and between river systems downstream or upstream to lakes, could colonize many different lakes throughout a large basin.', 'There are two general explanations for how a fish species might end up in different lakes separated by hundreds of miles.', 'Leaving aside the obvious answer that humans often deliberately introduce fish to lakes and ponds, we can draw a comparison with the population of isolated islands. Just as an island may once have been connected by a land bridge, so lakes may originally have been part of river systems that dried up. Or a river may have flooded long ago and briefly flowed into low-lying land to create a populated lake.', 'Finally, humans are responsible for ""dispersing"" fish great distances. In many cases, this occurs intentionally because people want to be able to fish for a particular species outside of that species\'s native range. For example, in the late 19th century concerted efforts were made by the U.S. Fish Commission to introduce carp—as a food fish—into the waters of the western U.S. Now these fish can be found throughout lakes and reservoirs across the entire region.', 'We have reviewed a large amount of literature mainly on the relationship between man and fish in freshwaters from late medieval times (defined here as the fifteenth century) until the early twenty-first century. The main focus is on freshwater (including anadromous and catadromous) fish in northern Europe, the main area of study for both authors, though examples have been included from elsewhere to indicate the widespread importance of these fisheries.

"Does ""Kids Songs"" actually benefit kids over other music?","While kids' songs can be engaging and fun, and can also teach specific skills like the alphabet, counting, or rhyming, research suggests that exposing children to a variety of music is actually beneficial for learning and memory development[1]. Kids' songs may have some benefits like repetition and obvious rhymes that can help catch toddlers' attention, and they may also be about subjects kids are interested in[3]. However, it is important to note that music made specifically for kids is often very simple and may lack the complexity of music made for adults, which could benefit children more[4]. Ultimately, the best type of music for kids will depend on the child, and it is important to consider the potential benefits of exposing a child to music[5].","['While kids’ songs can sometimes teach specific skills, like the alphabet, counting, or rhyming, more complex songs promote learning in a more basic way. Toddlers benefit from variety in music – from music that’s marketed specifically towards them to music parents played for them before they were even born, to whatever catches their attention on the radio. Varied music helps activate learning and memory, and while kids’ songs can be pretty one-note, when you open up the wide world of music for grown-ups to Baby, he is suddenly exposed to a whole host of different keys, tempos, and styles.', 'So no one is saying that children’s songs aren’t great – they’re engaging and fun, and children also can’t pick up any, shall we say, colorful language in kid-friendly songs, which isn’t always true of popular music marketed towards adults.

How are humans able to recognize attractiveness or 'cuteness' in another species?,"Humans are able to recognize attractiveness or ""cuteness"" in other species due to a phenomenon called attractiveness bias or the “Beauty-Is-Good Stereotype”[1].

Cuteness is also a scientific concept and analytical model in ethology, first introduced by Konrad Lorenz, and is associated with youth and appearance as well as a set of facial and body features that make a creature appear ""cute"" and activate (""release"") in others the motivation to care for it[4]. However, this perception of cuteness can have a dark side, as it can leave subjectively less attractive animals in the race for our affection, leading to less research and conservation funding for these species[5].","['Recently, researchers from the University of Melbourne led by Christoph Klebl explored another factor that affects our preferences for some species over others—pure physical attractiveness. They knew that attractive people are more likely to be perceived as intelligent and competent than unattractive individuals.

"Among animal species, why do humans have a need to be clothe, especially in public","Humans have a need to be clothed in public due to speciesism, which is the discrimination against animals of other species[1][2]. This is perpetuated because we have been taught to believe that animals are inferior beings and we benefit from exploiting them for clothing[2]. Speciesism also means that even when animals are not exploited, they are still discriminated against because they are not taken into serious consideration[4]. Additionally, humans are increasingly aware of the horrific cruelty involved in the production of animal-based clothing and accessories, and are choosing to opt for vegan items instead[5].","['Speciesism is so commonplace that most people don’t think to question it except in cases where the type or degree of discrimination is unusual in their culture. As a result, humans exploit nonhuman animals in the course of everyday life, using them as resources. This happens in a variety of ways. Nonhuman animals are consumed as food, used for clothing, tormented and killed for entertainment, exploited for work, and raised and killed so their body parts can be used as raw materials in cosmetics and other consumer products. They are, essentially, slaves.', 'Why do the great majority of humans either ignore or defend discrimination against nonhuman animals? The reasons are simple. First, we have been taught since childhood to believe that animals of other species are inferior beings that don’t deserve much consideration. Second, we benefit from the exploitation of nonhuman animals, particularly in consuming their bodies and fluids as foods. Therefore we have little incentive to challenge these beliefs. Our beliefs make it seem acceptable to exploit other animals, and the benefits we derive from their exploitation motivate our beliefs. It’s convenient to accept the received wisdom that other animals are inferior and to accept this as something “obvious.” But such a view cannot be justified.', 'This is an exciting time—more so than ever before, people are against wearing animals. From mohair hats to shearling jackets to leather shoes, shoppers are ditching cruel and environmentally toxic items in favor of compassionate and sustainable vegan items.', 'Even when animals are not exploited, they are still the victims of speciesism. They are discriminated against because they are not taken into serious consideration.2 Humans have a variety of attitudes towards animals. There are some who don’t treat animals with any respect at all. A minority of people don’t have any concern for the way animals are treated and are not concerned even when animals are tortured pointlessly. A less extreme version of this view is shown by people who are opposed to torturing animals in some unusual ways or merely for the fun of it, yet don’t think it matters very much that animals suffer because of the way humans treat them as long as humans benefit from it.', 'Every year, billions of animals suffer and die for clothing and accessories. Skin is torn from them to make leather, birds are held down while handfuls of feathers are ripped out of their sensitive skin, and small animals are caged for life before being killed for their fur. Sheep are often beaten and mutilated by workers stealing their wool and their skin for shearling. Goats are similarly abused for cashmere and mohair. All this is done in the name of fashion.

Can insects hear the sounds bats use for echolocation?,"Yes, some insects can hear the sounds bats use for echolocation. These insects include some moths, beetles, and crickets[5]. When these insects hear an echolocating bat, some will turn and fly away, while others will start flying in a zigzag, spiral, or looping pattern to avoid being eaten by the bat[5]. Additionally, some crickets and beetles are known to make clicking sounds that startle the bat and scare it off[5].","[""Bats navigate and find insect prey using echolocation. They produce sound waves at frequencies above human hearing, called ultrasound. The sound waves emitted by bats bounce off objects in their environment. Then, the sounds return to the bats' ears, which are finely tuned to recognize their own unique calls. Scientists and managers can identify and study bats by recording their calls with specialized microphones and recording devices. The bat calls can be translated into forms humans can see and hear."", 'Many species of insect-eating bats use quiet echolocation calls of around 60 to 80 decibels, which insect detectors hear only when the bat gets within about three feet (one meter). Low-strength calls seem to be associated with gleaners – bats that snatch their prey from leaves, the ground, and other surfaces. These bats probably find their targets not with echolocation but by listening for sounds of the insect’s movements or its efforts to attract a mate.', 'Echolocation – emitting sounds, mostly above the range of human hearing, and analyzing the echoes that bounce back – allows aerial-feeding bats to detect, track, and assess potential prey. It lets them hunt flying insects under nighttime conditions that range from the confounding shadows of moonlight to the uniform darkness of an overcast night.', ""The frequencies used by echolocating bats range generally from 20 kHz to 100 kHz, with some outliers using frequencies below 10 kHz or above 200 kHz. Higher frequencies improve resolution, but they attenuate at a greater rate (Surlykke 1988) and the detection distance is reduced accordingly. The source level is the sound pressure level (SPL relative to 20 µPa), in decibels (dB), measured 10 cm in front of the bat's mouth. A bat using a source level of 110 dB at 20 kHz could detect the echo from an object the size of a moth at more than 5 m. Detection would occur at no more than 2.4 m if the bat used 100 kHz (Surlykke 1988). From the insects' perspective, bats advertise their presence with the ultrasonic pulses used to stroboscopically probe the environment. Thus, insects are forewarned if they can hear ultrasound. This coincidentally exerts considerable selection pressure against those insects that either cannot hear or do not react (Miller 1982)."", 'Humans cannot hear ultrasonic sounds made by echolocating bats. But there are some insects that can hear these ultrasonic sounds. These insects include some moths, beetles, and crickets. When moths hear an echolocating bat, some will turn and fly away.

"Since water expands as it freezes, why will the ocean levels rise if the ice caps melt?","When ice on land slides into the ocean, it displaces ocean water and causes sea level to rise[1][4]. Additionally, when ocean water freezes to form sea ice and then melts, the melt water adds 2.6% more water to the ocean than the water displaced by the ice, or the equivalent of approximately 4 centimeters (1.57 inches) of sea-level rise[1][2]. The higher temperature of the water also causes the density of water to decrease, thus making the oceans rise[1][3][4]. In addition, thawing Arctic land ice can raise sea levels even more via a mechanism called thermal expansion[4]. Finally, the rising temperature and icebergs could also play a small role in the rising ocean level by weakening the glaciers and causing more chunks of ice to break off and fall into the ocean[5].","['When ice on land slides into the ocean, it displaces ocean water and causes sea level to rise. People believe that when this floating ice melts, water level doesn’t rise an additional amount because the freshwater ice displaces the same volume of water as it would contribute once it melts. Similarly, people also think that when ocean water freezes to form sea ice and then melts, the water is merely going through a change of state, so it won’t affect sea level. However, in a visit to NSIDC in May, Dr. Peter Noerdlinger, a professor at St. Mary’s University in Nova Scotia, Canada, suggested otherwise.', 'In a paper titled ""The Melting of Floating Ice will Raise the Ocean Level"" submitted to Geophysical Journal International, Noerdlinger demonstrates that melt water from sea ice and floating ice shelves could add 2.6% more water to the ocean than the water displaced by the ice, or the equivalent of approximately 4 centimeters (1.57 inches) of sea-level rise.', 'But there might be a less dramatic reason than polar ice melting for the higher ocean level -- the higher temperature of the water. Water is most dense at 4 degrees Celsius. Above and below this temperature, the density of water decreases (the same weight of water occupies a bigger space). So as the overall temperature of the water increases it naturally expands a little bit making the oceans rise.', 'In addition to simply adding water to the ocean, thawing Arctic land ice can raise sea levels even more via a mechanism called thermal expansion. “In a warmer climate the ocean absorbs a lot of extra heat from the climate system, and as a result it becomes less dense,” Rignot explains. As Arctic land ice melts into the sea, there is more ocean water overall—and thus more water to heat up and expand as the climate warms, which drives up sea levels even more. “The amount it expands is significant, enough that we can measure it,” Dutton says. From 1993 to 2010 thermal expansion added an average of 1.1 millimeters of sea level rise per year, according to the International Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (pdf).', 'But the rising temperature and icebergs could play a small role in the rising ocean level. Icebergs are chunks of frozen glaciers that break off from landmasses and fall into the ocean. The rising temperature may be causing more icebergs to form by weakening the glaciers, causing more cracks and making ice mo\xadre likely to break off. As soon as the ice falls into the ocean, the ocean rises a little.']"

Why do poachers kill rhinos for horns rather than just harmlessly dehorning them?

"If I eat a baked potato and 2 tablespoons of olive oil, it's healthy. If chop up the potato and fry it in the oil first, it's unhealthy. Why?","Eating a baked potato and olive oil is healthy because olive oil is rich in healthy monounsaturated fats, and baking the potato causes some of the starch to become resistant starch, which is difficult to digest, meaning you get fewer calories and carbohydrates[1]. Frying the potato in the oil makes it unhealthy because it adds unhealthy saturated fats to the meal[2], while baking the potato is a healthier option because it keeps the potato fat-free and preserves its fiber content.","['This recipe swaps traditional mayonnaise, which is high in calories, sodium, and saturated fats, according to the USDA, for olive oil, which is rich in healthy monounsaturated fats.

In addition, because the potatoes in this recipe are cooked and then cooled, some of the starch becomes what is known as resistant starch, according to a study published in October 2016 in Food Chemistry. As a study in the October 2017 American Society for Microbiology points out, resistant starch is somewhat difficult to digest, which means that you’ll get fewer calories and carbohydrates from the potatoes when they are prepared in this way.

Why don't we breed endangered species the same way we breed cattle or dogs?,"Cloning endangered species is not a feasible or effective conservation strategy at present due to a number of reasons. First, cloning does not address the reasons why many animals become endangered in the first place, such as hunting and habitat destruction[2]. Additionally, current cloning techniques are too ineffective to make much of a difference[2]. Also, in order to achieve successful clones, researchers often have to combine DNA from the threatened species with eggs from a related domestic species, which can have negative genetic effects in decreasing the fitness of captive-bred organisms[4]. Furthermore, it is difficult to acquire eggs from endangered species due to legal protections and lack of knowledge of reproductive physiology[4]. Lastly, the story of cloning endangered animals is one of a few high-profile successes and many, many failures[1][2][5].","['Since then some biologists have repeatedly suggested that cloning could help save endangered species, especially in dire situations in which only a few dozen or a handful of animals remain. The smaller, more homogenous and more inbred a population, the more susceptible it is to a single harmful genetic mutation or disease. Clones could theoretically increase the genetic diversity of an endangered population if researchers have access to preserved DNA from many different individuals. At the very least, clones could stabilize a shrinking population. And, some researchers argue, a genetically homogenous but stable population would be better than extinction; some highly inbred groups of wild animals, such as Chillingham cattle in England, have survived just fine for hundreds of years.', 'Many researchers agree that, at present, cloning is not a feasible or effective conservation strategy. First of all, some conservationists point out, cloning does not address the reasons that many animals become endangered in the first place—namely, hunting and habitat destruction. Even if cloning could theoretically help in truly desperate situations, current cloning techniques are simply too ineffective to make much of a difference. Compared with cloning domestic species—particularly cattle, which have been successfully cloned for years to duplicate desirable traits—cloning endangered species is far more difficult for a number of reasons.', 'While captive breeding sounds like an ideal solution for preventing endangered animals from facing serious threats of extinction there are still reasons to believe that these programs can occasionally do more harm than good. Some detrimental effects include delays in understanding optimal conditions required for reproduction, failure to reach self-sustaining levels or provide sufficient stock for release, loss of genetic diversity due to inbreeding, and poor success in reintroductions despite available captive-bred young. Although it has been proven that captive breeding programs have yielded negative genetic effects in decreasing the fitness of captive-bred organisms, there is no direct evidence to show that this negative effect also decreases the overall fitness of their wild-born descendants.', 'All those attempted clones of endangered or extinct animals died in different ways for different reasons, but they all shared one fundamental problem—they were not exact replicas of their counterparts. In most cases, researchers have combined DNA from the threatened species with eggs from a related domestic species. Each surrogate mother is often implanted with dozens of hybrid embryos in order to achieve at least a few pregnancies, a strategy that requires extracting hundreds of eggs. Because the reproductive physiology of most endangered animals is so poorly understood, researchers are often unsure when the animals ovulate and how best to acquire their eggs. In some cases legal protections prevent scientists from harvesting eggs from threatened species. For all these reasons, they turn to more familiar domestic species instead.', 'Right now, though, cloning is unlikely to help the white rhino or any other threatened species. To date, the story of cloning endangered animals is one of a few high-profile successes and many, many failures. Since the early 2000s, using the same technique that produced Dolly, researchers have cloned several endangered and even extinct mammals, including a mouflon sheep and a bovine known as a gaur in 2001; a kind of wild cattle called a banteng in 2003; a wild goat known as the Pyrenean ibex in 2009; and wild coyotes in 2012. In each case many more clones died before birth than survived; in most cases none of the clones survived into adulthood.']"
Why is slashing the neck of a chicken considered a more humane method than decapitating it?,"Slashing the neck of a chicken is considered a more humane method than decapitating it because it causes a combination of rupturing the spinal cord and disrupting the blood flow to the brain by rupturing the blood vessels in the neck[4], which kills the bird quickly. Decapitating a bird releases a large amount of blood very quickly, which tends to go everywhere as the bird will still move due to nerve spasms[2]. Furthermore, neck dislocation without prior stunning has been found to be more effective at concussing the brain and causing immediate insensibility than neck cutting[3]. Additionally, neck cutting may risk the spread of disease from spillage of blood and bodily fluids[4]. Therefore, slashing the neck of a chicken is considered to be a more humane method.","['Electrical or concussion stunning followed by neck-cutting or neck dislocation are more appropriate, humane methods of killing poultry.', 'Decapitating a bird also releases a large amount of blood very quickly, which tends to go everywhere as the bird will still move due to nerve spasms. Also, if you are killing a bird for meat and need to dunk it straight away into hot water (to loosen feathers to help with plucking), it can get very messy.', 'Neck dislocation without prior stunning has been widely used as a method of killing poultry. However, research findings have suggested that neck dislocation does not consistently concuss the brain and it is unlikely to cause immediate insensibility.', 'Neck dislocation may be preferable to neck cutting following the stunning of diseased casualty birds, to avoid the risk of disease spread from spillage of blood and bodily fluids. Neck dislocation kills the bird by a combination of rupturing the spinal cord, which stops breathing, and by disrupting the blood flow to the brain by rupturing the blood vessels in the neck.', '- I think that everyone agrees that if we must kill animals for food then it is our duty as civilised human beings, to ensure that the animals are killed as quickly and humanely as possible.

What is happening to a dog's body physiologically when an owner leaves them in the car on a hot day?,"When a dog is left in a car on a hot day, their body is put under immense heat stress as they are unable to release heat by sweating, like humans[3]. The temperature inside a car can quickly rise to more than double the outside temperature, even on mild days[2], and the dog's inability to cool down by sweating means they must rely on panting to cool down[3]. However, this is ineffective if the air around them is too hot[3]. This can lead to dehydration, as the dog is unable to replace lost body fluids[4], and can cause heatstroke, which can damage the dog's cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous and muscular systems[4]. In addition, the thick fur coats of dogs make them even more susceptible to heat injury than humans[5].","['For a dog, though, harmful, and even life-threatening effects can occur in a short time in a hot car. Dogs can’t release heat by sweating, as humans do, so their internal body temperature rises more quickly.', 'Even on mild days, it’s dangerous for animals to be left in a car. Most people understand that if dogs are left in cars during hot weather they are subject to dangerous conditions, but there really is NO safe situation to leave your dog unattended in a vehicle. While it may not feel hot to you, weather conditions can change quickly, and with them, your dog’s chances of survival. Even if the weather stays mild, cars are made of metal and glass which absorb heat, so they can heat up quickly at any time of the year. Temperatures inside a car can climb to more than double the outside temperature in a matter of minutes.', 'Unlike humans, dogs have very few sweat glands, so these are not effective at cooling them down. Instead, they need to rely on panting, which produces moist air, but if the air around them is too hot, they are unable to get their body temperature back to normal. It is also important to know that no measures you take can prevent heatstroke if your dog is left in a car – leaving the windows down, parking in a cool spot in the shade, tinting glass windows or leaving water in the car only offer a false sense of security.', 'Dehydration is another risk of dogs being left in cars. This occurs when an animal is unable to replace lost body fluids (water and electrolytes) that are essential for healthy functioning. Dehydration can quickly become a medical emergency and contribute to heatstroke. The secondary effects of heatstroke are widespread, affecting the cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous and muscular systems. Dogs who experience heatstroke can be left with serious medical problems such as kidney damage.', 'In those temperatures, humans would have ample problem keeping their bodies cool enough to avoid heat injury. Dogs, on the other hand, are in an even worse condition in excessive heat since they have thick fur coats and don’t sweat. Dogs cool themselves through panting—rapidly moving air through their respiratory tract—but panting is ineffective against high heats like the inside of a car during the summer.']"
"Climate Change - If CO2 levels were dramatically higher in history, why are we concerned with rising levels now?","We are concerned with rising levels of CO2 now because current-day CO2 levels are already too high according to some climate scientists, and if fossil-fuel burning continues at a business-as-usual rate, CO2 levels could reach as high as 1500 ppm[2]. Additionally, CO2 levels have surpassed 400 ppm for the first time in recorded history[3], and are now comparable to the Pliocene Climatic Optimum which was around 4.5 million years ago, when sea levels were 5-25 meters higher than today and temperatures were 7 degrees Fahrenheit higher than pre-industrial times[4]. Furthermore, regardless of which estimate is correct, it is clear that CO2 levels are higher than ever before in mankind’s history, and are likely to exceed 450 ppm in the future[5].","['“This was a time when global temperatures were substantially warmer than today, and there was very little ice around anywhere on the planet. And so sea level was considerably higher — around 100 feet higher — than it is today,” said Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann, in an email conversation. “It is for this reason that some climate scientists, like James Hansen, have argued that even current-day CO2 levels are too high. There is the possibility that we’ve already breached the threshold of truly dangerous human influence on our climate and planet.”', 'If fossil-fuel burning continues at a business-as-usual rate, such that humanity exhausts the reserves over the next few centuries, CO2 will continue to rise to levels of order of 1500 ppm. The atmosphere would then not return to pre-industrial levels even tens of thousands of years into the future. This graph not only conveys the scientific measurements, but it also underscores the fact that humans have a great capacity to change the climate and planet.', ""Ancient air bubbles trapped in ice enable us to step back in time and see what Earth's atmosphere, and climate, were like in the distant past. They tell us that levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere are higher than they have been at any time in the past 400,000 years. During ice ages, CO2 levels were around 200 parts per million (ppm), and during the warmer interglacial periods, they hovered around 280 ppm (see fluctuations in the graph). In 2013, CO2 levels surpassed 400 ppm for the first time in recorded history. This recent relentless rise in CO2 shows a remarkably constant relationship with fossil-fuel burning, and can be well accounted for based on the simple premise that about 60 percent of fossil-fuel emissions stay in the air."", 'CO2 levels are now comparable to the Pliocene Climatic Optimum, between 4.1 and 4.5 million years ago, when they were close to, or above 400 ppm.

"Why do people mostly eat hens, and not roosters?","People mostly eat hens and not roosters because it is far less economical to raise roosters for their meat[1][2][3][4].

Why are some animals much more aggressive than others?,"There are several reasons why some animals can be much more aggressive than others. First, temperament is an important factor in defining aggression in animals. Some animals become aggressive as a means of communication, to display authority over a certain territory, or to indicate their strength over another same animal[1]. Aggression can also occur when animals fight over resources such as food, shelter, and potential mates[3]. In addition, aggression in most species starts with relatively harmless displays or postures[4][5], and the benefits of aggressive competition may be higher than its costs for highly aggressive species, while the opposite may be true for less aggressive species[5].","['Why some animals become aggressive is not simply the cause of one thing. Rather it might be a means communication, to display authority over a certain territory, to indicate their strength over another same animal.', 'The strongest creatures on the planet do not automatically make up the list of most aggressive animals. Temperament is what plays an important role in defining aggression in animals. Not all animals become aggressive and turn into blind rage fits, but some do.', 'Aggression sometimes occurs when parents defend their young from attack by members of their own species. Female mice, for example, defend their pups against hostile neighbours, while male stickleback fish defend eggs and fry against cannibalistic attack. More frequently, however, animals fight over resources such as food and shelter—e.g., vultures fight over access to carcasses, and hermit crabs fight over empty shells. Another important resource over which fighting commonly occurs is potential mates. In this case the biology of gamete production has an influence on aggressive behaviour: because a female’s eggs are larger, are fewer in number, and require more energy to produce than a male’s sperm, competition among males over females is usually more frequent and intense than competition among females over males. As a result, the most spectacular fights among animals, whether they are crickets, salmon, tree frogs, chaffinches, or stags, occur between males over fertile females.', 'A common feature of aggression in most species is that fights tend to start with relatively harmless displays or postures. For example, aggressive interactions between two red deer stags begin with an exchange of deep roars followed by a display of “parallel walking,” in which the stags strut side by side assessing their relative size. The aggression may then escalate to direct attacks during which the stags charge at each other, stabbing and wrestling with their antlers. Most confrontations are resolved early while displaying, but many others continue to the point of intense and dangerous fighting.', 'In animal species that are relatively less aggressive, the benefits of aggressive competition are probably lower than its costs. It is also possible that less aggressive species can pursue alternative competitive strategies with higher benefit/cost ratios than competitive aggression. Finally, regardless of benefits and costs, there may be physical, social, ecological, or behavioral constraints that make it difficult or impossible for aggression to be expressed in these species (e.g., in sessile marine invertebrates, highly solitary animals, or small nocturnal animals under heavy predation pressure). The opposite is true for highly aggressive species. Here the benefits of aggression are presumably higher than its costs, making aggression the preferred competitive strategy. In addition, there may be few or no constraints on the expression of aggressive behavior.']"

Meanwhile, captive breeding—and the captivity of wild animals in general—raises a wide range of concerns.

Many researchers have turned to artificial insemination in an attempt to increase the populations of endangered animals. It also creates more genetically diverse captive populations, enabling captive facilities to easily share genes with each other. Its success, so far, has been somewhat limited. This article was published in August 2014, after Sea World announced the birth of two Magellanic penguins conceived through artificial insemination. Along with pandas and ferrets, there have also been successful births of a white-naped crane, Przewalski’s horse, and possibly, elephants.', 'A potential technique for aiding in reproduction of endangered species is interspecific pregnancy, implanting embryos of an endangered species into the womb of a female of a related species, carrying it to term.

Left to their own devices, bison breed well but what they can’t do is move around the globe – so to transport new genes to different areas requires the use of IVF.']"
Cell regeneration,"Cell regeneration is the natural process of replacing or restoring damaged or missing cells, tissues, organs, and even entire body parts to full function in plants and animals[3]. Cell Regeneration is an open access academic journal launched by the Chinese Society for Cell Biology in 2019, with the aim of positioning the journal at the forefront of basic and applied research of stem cell biology, regenerative biology and regenerative medicine[2]. Research into cell regeneration has potential uses in medicine, such as treating a variety of injuries and diseases, and provides an insight into the human aging process through the study of regeneration[3]. Apoptosis plays an important role in regeneration and can control the microenvironment in which tumors arise, making the study of apoptosis important for cancer treatment[5]. Comparative studies of apoptosis in cancer and regeneration can help to understand the differences in controlled vs. dysregulated proliferation[5].","['Cell Regeneration aims to provide a worldwide platform for researches on stem cells and regenerative biology to develop basic science and to foster its clinical translation in medicine.

Further investigations into this topic may provide new perspectives in understanding the functions of apoptosis in diseased tissues.']"
Do the strikes doctors are taking interfere with the Hippocratic Oath?,"It is controversial whether or not the strikes doctors are taking interfere with the Hippocratic Oath. Some argue that the Hippocratic Oath obliges doctors to work exclusively for the benefit of the patient and not to inflict any harm on them, which is not compatible with the withdrawal of the sick implicit in any strike action[1][2]. Others argue that the Hippocratic Oath to which doctors are required to adhere carries an injunction: ""the health of my patient will be my first consideration"" and so doctors may feel ethically and morally obliged to intervene on behalf of their patients and this intervention may ultimately result in a strike action or withdrawal of services, in an effort to improve conditions for patient care[1]. Furthermore, the existing labour relation laws provide various kinds of protections and immunities to striking unions, regardless of whether they are takers of the Hippocratic Oath[3]. Finally, the Hippocratic Oath is often not sufficient to address the ethical implications of modern healthcare, such as the proliferation of the third-payer system and the intrusion of health insurance providers and corporate hospitals, which can affect the physician treatment paradigm and limit the autonomy of physicians in providing the best possible treatment for their patients[4]. Therefore, the strikes doctors are taking may interfere with the Hippocratic Oath, depending on the circumstances and the intentions of the doctors involved[1].","['It must be recognized that doctors and HCWs are ethically obliged to provide the best possible care for their patients. The Hippocratic Oath to which doctors are required to adhere carries injunction: ""the health of my patient will be my first consideration"" . Therefore in the circumstances where the health of the patient is threatened; for example where there is a failure to provide adequate drugs or proper facilities for patient care. Doctors may feel ethically and morally obliged to intervene on behalf of their patients and this intervention may ultimately result in a strike action or withdrawal of services, in an effort to improve conditions for patient care [7, 12, 20, 22, 27, 28]. One can argue that the resulting improvement in overall quality of healthcare services when negotiated changes are implemented mitigates any immediate harm of strike actions . Therefore indirectly, strike actions by HCWs may ultimately result in better healthcare for patients and the public in general.', 'a) The strike is unacceptable because it violates the primary professional duty not to harm, imposed both by the classical tradition of primum non nocere and by the modern principle of non-maleficence. The withdrawal of the sick, implicit in any strike, is hardly compatible with the clause of the Hippocratic Oath which obliges the doctor to work exclusively for the benefit of the patient and not to inflict any harm on him or her. The health professions will never have work-related and technical reasons to justify the unilateral withdrawal of patients and thus defraud the trust they have placed in them.', 'But as already pointed, the extant labour relation laws (especially the Trades Dispute Act) prepared various kinds of protections and immunities to striking unions irrespective of whether they are takers of Hippocratic oath. It is regrettable on a general note to say that in spite of the comparatively large salaries doctors take home, they appear always to be at the forefront of industrial conflict in this country. The oath does not seem to impose on them some kind of restraint.', 'When the oath was formulated, there existed only a tripartite relationship in medicine: between the patient, physician, and illness. This harmony was disrupted by the advent of health insurance, malpractice issues, technology, and pharmaceutical companies. The recent increase in government regulation, the proliferation of the third-payer system, and the democratization of medical knowledge all place pressures on physicians that are new to the last 40 years; their ethical implications are not satisfactorily addressed by the modern Hippocratic oath. Doctors may not be able to prescribe the best possible treatment for their patients due to economic restraints. Universal healthcare coverage is a state responsibility only in a few developed countries. The intrusion of health insurance providers and corporate hospitals affect the physician treatment paradigm, thus affecting the physicians’ autonomy in treatment.', 'The case, however, is not flatly the same with takers of the Hippocratic oath (also known as physicians oath). In the oath adopted by Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria from the General Assembly of World Medical Association of Geneva 1948, prospective medical practitioners before they are issued with a practice license, will have to freely but solemnly swear to consecrate their lives to the service of humanity, to “make the health of their patients their first consideration” and to maintain the utmost respect for human life. This clearly means that actions howsoever which could be calculated to infer that medical practitioners give priority to anything else other the health of their patients amounts to a breach of the sacred oath.']"
food fiber. Is it actually fibers?,"Yes, food fiber is actually fibers. Fibers are primarily non-digestible carbohydrates that are components of plant foods, such as fruits, vegetables, dried beans and peas, lentils, nuts, and seeds[1][3]. Dietary fiber is composed of non-starch polysaccharides and other plant components such as cellulose, resistant starch, resistant dextrins, inulin, lignins, chitins (in fungi), pectins, beta-glucans, and oligosaccharides[3].

Fibers are components of plant foods, fruits, vegetables, dried beans and peas, lentils, nuts, and seeds — any food that is classified as a plant. The fiber provides structure. Think of the celery stalk and the obvious vertical fiber strings that one often gets caught in their teeth. In addition, because fibers are non-digestible, they contribute to stool bulk and add form to the stool. People with irregularity are often advised to increase their fiber and fluid intake.', 'Fibers are indigestible carbohydrates found naturally in plant foods. They are often classified as either dietary (found naturally) or functional (added to foods).', 'Dietary fiber (in British English fibre) or roughage is the portion of plant-derived food that cannot be completely broken down by human digestive enzymes.

Dietary fiber has two main components: soluble fiber and insoluble fiber, which are components of plant-based foods, such as legumes, whole grains and cereals, vegetables, fruits, and nuts or seeds.

"Instead of removing the testicles and ovaries and uterus, why do so many veterinarians not perform vasectomies and tubal ligations?","Many veterinarians do not perform vasectomies and tubal ligations because they were not taught to do them in veterinary school and they have no incentive to learn the procedures[1]. Additionally, some veterinarians consider it unethical to perform these procedures and assume the desire for them is rooted in human conceit[2]. Furthermore, it can be difficult to find veterinarians who are willing to perform these procedures. Finally, most veterinarians recommend a hysterectomy over a tubal ligation due to the risk of pyometra, a serious disease that affects the uterus and cervix[5].","['Veterinarians don’t do vasectomies and tubal ligations because we weren’t taught to do them in school. Veterinarians at the forefront of change in veterinary medicine tend to be those in vet school settings. They influence all of us through the papers they write, and the students they teach. But they have no incentive to teach these procedures or ponder their significance. Even shelter medicine programs haven’t yet eyed this possibility. Adding another method to the mix is just too complicated…', 'But if you ask veterinarians across the country, the concept of a tubal ligation or vasectomy reeks of the unethical. That’s what I’ve been told by some colleagues, anyway. ""Why do something only halfway?"" Moreover, they assume the desire for these procedures comes down to mere human conceit (i.e., “I want my dog to keep his balls and I think it’s natural for him to continue to have sex.”).', 'Of all the e-mails and phone calls Fully Vetted brings my way, the single most commonly queried issue has to do with how to source a tubal ligation or vasectomy.

In this procedure, only the fallopian tubes are blocked, cut, or tied to prevent eggs from entering the uterus for fertilization. But about 25% of dogs get pyometra – a serious disease that affects the uterus and cervix and often requires emergency surgery. A hysterectomy that removes ALL the cervix and uterine tissue avoids the possibility of pyometra – a major advantage over tubal ligation.']"
"if the earth is 4 billion years old, how is ~75 years a big enough sample size to determine a link between humans and climate change?","While the Earth is 4 billion years old, the effects of human activity on the climate can be accurately measured in a sample size of ~75 years. This is because the use of fossil fuels has greatly increased in the last 100 years, resulting in a rapid increase in greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. We also have data from surveys conducted on 10,000 children and young people in 10 countries, which show that thoughts and feelings about climate change are linked to government responses[2]. Additionally, the human population has grown from 1 billion in 1804 to over 7 billion today in just over 200 years[3], further increasing the amount of emissions.

Sometimes their enhanced abilities to make a living outstripped their local environment’s capacity to provide that living, and they disrupted local ecological systems. On several continents, for example, humans hunted large mammals to the point where many, such as the marsupial lion of Australia, went extinct. As humans became more efficient at exploiting their local environments, they spread farther. By 13,000 years ago, modern humans had spread to all continents and many islands across the globe.

Why are there big felines (lions) and no big canines?,"Wild cats are typically larger than wild canines because they are solitary hunters, while canines are usually pack hunters. Furthermore, large cats have the advantage of being able to hunt larger prey than canines, while also not having to compete directly with them, since big, fierce animals are rare[1]. Additionally, cats need a higher proportion of good quality protein than dogs do, and this would be difficult for them to find if they were to become pack hunters[1]. Finally, large canine species can be found in the fossil record, but the biggest extant wild dog species is the Northwestern Wolf, which is still much smaller than the largest cats[4].","['- The comparative size of domestic dogs and cats misleads us, but the largest felines are considerably bigger than the largest canines. Even the largest wolves are considerably smaller than tigers for example. This is genetic, the largest dogs such as St Bernards are still smaller than the largest tigers. But lifestyle also affects optimum size. If you are a pack hunter as dogs are you can get larger prey than if you are a solitary hunter of the same size. Being smaller has advantages in hard times. So why do cats not evolve into pack hunters? Well, lions do operate in this way often, but I can only imagine that in the habitat of most big cats, pack hunting would not satisfy the feline need for a higher proportion of good quality protein than dogs need, and would also bring them into direct competition with dogs, or similar species. Big, fierce animals are rare, and always have been.', 'I think many answers are missing the point entirely. At least from what I assume the question is asking - why are there (naturally occurring) big cats and no (naturally occurring) big dogs.', 'Some big cats are social. Lions live in prides with other lions. Tigers will sometimes socialize with each other, but they are solitary hunters. Not all canines are pack animals. Coyotes tend to be solitary.', 'As someone who has recently welcomed a new dog to the family (see my Twitter account for occasional photos), canines are on my mind. Our newest addition is going to be big, much bigger than any non-human I’ve lived with, and the video below helps raise a question I’d never considered: we have big cats (lions, tigers, etc.) in the wild, but why don’t we have any equivalent big dogs? We breed large dogs like Great Danes, but these are all variants of the same species as Toy Poodles, and are driven through human breeding efforts. Although large dog species can be found in the fossil record, the Northwestern Wolf is the biggest extant wild dog species, but their size doesn’t come close to that of the bigger cats.', '-   -   - Dogs and cats are the two most popular domesticated animals.

How come domesticated animals such as goats need to have their hooves trimmed to prevent injury? How do wild animals solve that problem?,"Domesticated animals such as goats need to have their hooves trimmed to prevent injury because they do not travel long distances and their hooves do not get worn down naturally, like wild goats[5]. Wild goats travel long distances looking for food and often play on rough rocks and hard ground, which helps keep their hooves somewhat trimmed and cared for[5]. If their hooves do get too long, the tips usually break off naturally, making the goat temporarily lame, but if not taken care of, it can lead to pain and lameness in domesticated goats[5].","['If it seems like a goat’s hooves need trimming more often than you’d expect, you can help keep their growth at bay naturally by providing hard surfaces for them to walk on, such as a set of paver stones or level concrete between their indoor living spaceThe indoor or outdoor area where an animal resident lives, eats, and rests. and pasture to help keep their hooves better maintained, though this may not be appropriate for individuals with severe arthritis or other mobility issues.', 'Just like the nails on your hands and feet, goats have hooves made out of the durable protein keratin on their feet! And just like us, this consistently growing material needs to be maintained for their health and comfort. In the wild, a goat would naturally wear down their hooves by frequent walking and climbing, but in most sanctuary environments hooves will not be worn down enough through activity alone. Thus, it is our responsibility to trim their hooves regularly for their wellbeing!', 'Hoof trimming is an important part of a dairy operation. Goats free of lameness will be more productive, more active, and have longevity in the herd. The more frequently hoof trimming is done the easier the task will be and the less time it will take. It is important to note that long hooves are unacceptable to ship off farm and are an animal welfare concern. Regular trimming also reduces the chance of infectious and non-infectious hoof lesions from developing. Overgrown hooves are a risk factor for developing hoof conditions such as foot scald (interdigital dermatitis), which can lead to foot rot or foot abscess. The key to keeping productive does in the herd is to keep well-trimmed hooves.', 'Typically, a goat needs their hooves trimmed once every six to ten weeks, although older goats and less active individuals (including those with Arthritis or CAE) may need more frequent trimming due to less normal usage keeping them worn down. Just like trimming your fingernails, properly trimming a goat’s hooves should not be painful, though some goats may not prefer the restraint required to properly assess and trim their hooves!', 'Wild goats travel long distances looking for food and often play on rough rocks and hard ground. All this activity helps keep their hooves somewhat trimmed and cared for. If their hooves do get too long, the tips usually break off naturally. This makes the goat pretty lame for a few days. Too bad for the goat if it encounters a wolf during these lame days (Bye, bye goat!). Tame or domesticated goats count on you to trim their hooves regularly. Otherwise, their hooves will get too long and they may even become lame from the pain. One of your most important duties as your doe’s owner is to regularly trim her hooves. Be warned, the first time you trim your goat’s hooves, you will probably get exhausted and it may even seem a little scary. But the more practice you get, the easier it becomes. Plan on trimming your goat’s hooves about every 6 to 8 weeks. Remember, the longer you let your goat’s hooves get, the harder the job will be.']"
"How can we only survive as omnivores, while other animals can survive only as carnivores/herbivores","Omnivores can survive in a variety of environments because they eat both plants and animals, while carnivores and herbivores must live in places where they can find their specific food sources[2]. If all animals on the planet only ate plants, millions of carnivore and omnivore species would die out[4]. Without herbivores and carnivores, the producers would be able to grow without being eaten or limited by predators, as they don't need the herbivores or carnivores to make their own food and energy[3].

Why is eye contact seen as aggression in some animals?,"Eye contact is seen as aggression in some animals because it can induce stress and send a threatening message[1]. In primates, eye contact is often seen as a signal of threat, and can connote social status and imminent physical aggression[1][5]. This is likely due to the relationship between eye contact tolerance and primate social structure, which is such that eye contact tolerance increases as social structures become more egalitarian[5].","['Among primates, eye contact is seen as especially aggressive, and staring at them in a zoo can induce agitated behavior. Chimpanzees use eye contact to signal aggression in hostile encounters. Eye tracking research shows that chimps are more likely to look at the mouth, while bonobos are more likely to look at the eyes; eye contact is lower among socially deprived primates. A 2007 incident at Rotterdam Zoo is believed to be connected to eye contact: Bokito the gorilla escaped from his exhibit and injured a woman who had visited him several times and apparently often held prolonged eye contact. Visitors were later given special glasses that averted their apparent gaze when looking at the gorilla.', ""It induces stress. Animals don't always hate eye contact, though. Although looking an unfamiliar dog in the eye will prompt aggression, when a dog makes eye contact with their owner, they get a release of oxytocin and dopamine in the brain."", 'In many human cultures, eye contact is viewed as a way to make a connection and show interest, but for dogs, eye contact sends a different message. Seeing eye-to-eye is likely viewed by your dog as more of a threat than a measure of good will. Depending on the socialization your dog received as a puppy, her genetic predisposition and her experience before you adopted her, eye contact may actually be perceived as a significant enough threat to spark aggression. Unless she is taught that eye contact is OK, it is possible that she could progress from simply being skittish to biting.', 'Eye contact can also be a significant factor in interactions between non-human animals, and between humans and non-human animals.', 'In most primates, eye contact is an implicit signal of threat, and often connotes social status and imminent physical aggression. However, in humans and some of the gregarious nonhuman primates, eye contact is tolerated more and may be used to communicate other emotional and mental states. What accounts for the variation in this critical social cue across primate species? We crowd-sourced primatologists and found a strong linear relationship between eye contact tolerance and primate social structure such that eye contact tolerance increased as social structures become more egalitarian. In addition to constituting the first generalizable demonstration of this relationship, our findings serve to inform the related question of why eye contact is deferentially avoided in some human cultures, while eye contact is both frequent and even encouraged in others.']"

Likewise, Peet’s buys a lot of coffee from TechnoServe, an organization working to improve the business practices of farmers in developing countries. “One of the objections to Fair Trade could be that the term ‘cooperative’ doesn’t perforce equate to ‘farmer,’” says Moayyad. “Just because a certain price is guaranteed to the cooperative, doesn’t actually mean that the farmer is receiving it.”', 'FLO rules cover artisans and farmers who produce not just coffee but also a variety of goods, including tea, cocoa, bananas, sugar, honey, rice, flowers, cotton, and even sports balls. Its certification process requires producing organizations to comply with a set of minimum standards “designed to support the sustainable development of small-scale producers and agricultural workers in the poorest countries in the world.” 2 These standards—31 pages of general and product-specific standards—detail member farm size, electoral processes and democratic organization, contractual transparency and reporting, and environmental standards, to name only a few. Supporting organizations, such as Fair Trade USA, in Oakland, Calif., ensure that the product is properly handled, labeled, and marketed in the consuming country.', 'Giuliano is among a growing group of coffee growers, roasters, and importers who believe that Fair Trade-certified coffee is not living up to its chief promise to reduce poverty. Retailers explain that neither FLO—the Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International umbrella group—nor Fair Trade USA, the American standards and certification arm of FLO, has sufficient data showing positive economic impact on growers. Yet both nonprofits state that their mission is to “use a market-based approach that empowers farmers to get a fair price for their harvest, helps workers create safe working conditions, provides a decent living wage, and guarantees the right to organize.”1 (In this article, the term Fair Trade coffee refers to coffee that has been certified as “Fair Trade” by FLO or Fair Trade USA; the term Fair Trade refers to the certification model of FLO and Fair Trade USA; and the term fair trade refers to the movement to improve the lives of growers and other producers through trade.)', 'One of the unique characteristics of the FLO and Fair Trade USA model is that only certain types of growers can qualify for certification—specifically, small growers who do not rely on permanent hired labor and belong to democratically run cooperatives. This means that private estate farmers and multinational companies like Kraft or Nestlé that grow their own coffee cannot be certified as Fair Trade coffee, even if they pay producers well, help create environmentally sustainable and organic products, and build schools and medical clinics for grower communities.', 'Recognizing the dire circumstances confronting farmers during the late 1980s, when the price of coffee once again plunged, fair trade activists formulated a system whereby farmers could obtain access to international markets and reasonable reward for their labor. In 1988 a coalition of those economic justice activists created the first fair trade certification initiative in the Netherlands, called Max Havelaar, after a fictional Dutch character who opposed the exploitation of coffee farmers by Dutch colonialists in the East Indies. The organization created a label for products that met certain wage standards. Other similar organizations arose within Europe, eventually merging in 1997 to create FLO, based in Bonn, Germany, which today sets the Fair Trade-certification standards and serves to inspect and certify the producer organizations.']"
Why is it smarter to eat fruits and veggies than to instead take a multivitamin and fiber supplement?,"Eating fruits and vegetables is smarter than taking multivitamin and fiber supplements because consuming the nutrients as food is more beneficial for health than consuming them as supplements[2].

Additionally, koalas are marsupials, not bears, and their young are carried in a pouch on the mother's stomach[5]. Therefore, it is not safe or legal to have these animals as pets.[1]","['No, it is not permitted anywhere in the world. It is illegal to have a Koala as a pet anywhere, even in Australia. The only people who are permitted to have a Koala in their possession, besides suitably authorised zoos, are, occasionally, scientists, and the people who are taking care of sick or injured Koalas or orphaned joeys. These people must have a special permit from wildlife authorities to do this work and the carers must return the animals to the wild as soon as they are well enough or, in the case of joeys, old enough, to take care of themselves. Because of Koalas’ unique physiological and dietary needs, it is a specialised job to take care of them and requires training from people who have experience in doing it. Koalas are wild animals. Don’t you think they are better off in the wild eucalyptus forests that are their natural home?', 'Koala bears’ front and back paws have sharp claws that look like talon tips. Most of the time, these claws are used to quickly climb trees for food or safety, but they can also be used to attack predators.', 'Some people think that the fact that there are foxes in Australia is why the number of koalas is going down, but this has not been proven. Foxes are also dangerous to chickens and other animals.', 'Koalas have few natural predators but can fall prey to dingoes, dogs, and foxes. If a predator attacks a koala, it will usually try to defend itself by using its sharp claws.', 'Most people think koalas are related to bears, but this is not true. Koalas are marsupials, which means they carry their young in a pouch on their stomach. A baby koala, called a joey, stays in its mother’s pouch for about six months. Once it is old enough to leave the pouch, the joey will ride on its mother’s back until it is about a year old.']"
Why does coffee seen to only be enjoyable at extreme temperatures? Anything in between tastes like mocha-vomit.,"Coffee can be more enjoyable at certain temperatures because of its complex flavours. At mid-range temperatures, our perception of both bitterness and sweetness is more acute[1]. Acidity is best perceived at lower temperatures[1][2], and the ideal serving temperature for coffee is between 82°C and 85°C[3]. However, drinking coffee at this temperature would scald your tongue, so people often drink it at temperatures below their thermal pain threshold. Experimenting with an instant-read thermometer can help to find the best temperature for enjoying coffee, as personal preferences vary and top-quality coffee is usually best enjoyed at close to 60 degrees Celsius[5].","['Our taste buds perceive flavours differently at different temperatures. We’re familiar with the concept of drinking wines at certain temperatures to best appreciate their individual nuances. The same concept applies to coffee. Experts have found that our perception of both bitterness and sweetness is more acute at mid-range temperatures i.e. not very hot, nor very cold. As low-quality coffee cools down its bitter notes become more apparent, which is why they seem to be more enjoyable at very hot temperatures. In contrast, high quality coffee tastes sweeter as it cools down.', 'Acidity can be perceived best at lower temperatures such as 25°C, compared to at 44°C or 70°C. For example, drinking a cup of Kenyan coffee at this temperature will allow it to become more vibrant, with higher acidity levels. It allows us to taste the full range of flavours that a single origin coffee has to offer and shows us that the same coffee can taste different at different temperatures. The same cup of coffee would be less flavourful at a higher temperature.', 'According to the National Coffee Association, the ideal serving temperature for coffee is between 82°C and 85°C. However, this would scald your tongue as temperatures in this range can exceed your thermal pain threshold. The most approved method of consuming coffee this way is through small sips or cupping ‘slurps’. This is where you only take in a small amount of liquid along with an inhale of air to cool the liquid down quickly.', '""Our tongues sense most effectively when things are at or near body temperature, so when a hot coffee \'stops\' tasting good at room temperature, it\'s because it wasn\'t great to begin with,"" Frith said.', 'You might like to experiment with an instant-read thermometer. Taste a just-brewed cup of coffee at a range of temperatures and notice the differences you perceive in its flavour. You could even try adding ice to see what types of coffee you enjoy as an iced coffee. Personal preferences vary, but we predict any cup of top-quality coffee will be at its most enjoyable at close to 60 degrees C. If you’re used to drinking coffee as soon as it’s brewed, you might be surprised to find you actually prefer it a little cooler. With just this slight adjustment in your regular coffee-making routine, you might improve the experience considerably. Why not give it a try?']"
"Why is canned dog food labeled as ""not fit for human consumption"" if it contains standard human-friendly ingredients like chicken, lamb, rice etc?","Canned dog food labeled as ""not fit for human consumption"" does not mean that it contains any ingredients that are dangerous for humans to consume, but rather that the food is not made to the same standards as foods intended for human consumption. The ingredients may be the same, but the processing and manufacturing of the food is different. For example, some pet food manufacturers use by-product sources, grains, and other additives like wheat, brewer’s rice, and corn gluten meal instead of healthy meats. They may also use ingredients that are not suitable for human consumption, such as bran, which has been removed from white flour and white rice[3]. Additionally, pet food manufacturers may mask bad smells coming from inferior by products with ingredients such as onion and garlic[4]. However, this does not mean that the food is unhealthy for pets - there are many modern quality pet foods that are nutritionally adequate and can provide long-lived health in animals[5].","['It should be noted in this SRF criticism of pet foods ""not fit for human consumption,"" that SRF foods made in their ""human quality USDA inspected"" facility are not fit for human consumption either.

Regardless of how much you pay for the bag or can, the ingredients are typical of poor quality pet food that is made from ingredients that are deemed not fit for human consumption.

Why is tuna the go-to canned fish when other species cost significantly less per pound?,"Tuna is the go-to canned fish when other species cost significantly less per pound because it is abundant and budget-friendly for U.S. consumers[2], and it is one of the top five aquaculture species consumed in the region[2].

Furthermore, canned tuna is globally popular, with a total value of $30 billion in 2014[1][2] and a 2.2 pound per capita consumption in the U.S. in 2019[2][5]. Bluefin tuna is the only species that grows to 489 pounds, but it is more expensive due to destructive fishing methods[4].","['In 2014, the total value of this processed tuna approached $30 billion. With canned tuna, volume is key. The price per metric ton may be modest, but the total tonnage is enormous. In 2012, more than 75 percent of all landed tuna went to canneries for processing. Two years later, 79 percent of landed tuna was destined for canneries.

Why are some animals easier to domesticate for farming/pets?,"Animals that are easier to domesticate for farming/pets are herbivores that graze on vegetation, as they are the easiest to feed and do not need humans to kill other animals to feed them[1].

The easiest animals to domesticate are herbivores that graze on vegetation, because they are easiest to feed: They do not need humans to kill other animals to feed them, or to grow special crops. Cows, for instance, are easily domesticated. Herbivores that eat grains are more difficult to domesticate than herbivores that graze because grains are valuable and also need to be domesticated. Chickens are herbivores that eat seeds and grain.', ""I doubt there's an animal that couldn't be domesticated with effort, but some are certainly easier than others. Here are some traits that facilitate domestication:"", ""Though it's theoretically possible to domesticate anything, the difficulty involved may have profound historical impact. Domesticating any animal requires a concerted effort spanning multiple human generations, and large mammals in particular are often dangerous and slow to breed. In Guns, Germs and Steel, Jared Diamond argues that technological development in the Americas was slower because people there lacked suitable pulling and riding animals. Perhaps, had a visionary farming family dedicated its dynasty to breeding a heat-tolerant, ride-on llama, the invading Spaniards would have met with a very different fate."", 'Although domesticated animals have brought humans invaluable advantages throughout history, they have not come without a price. One of the main disadvantages of animal domestication has been an increase in the number of diseases from contact with animals. Animal domestication has allowed the human population to increase and create densely populated areas, but at the same time has allowed for the transmission of pathogens from the animals—pathogens which otherwise may have remained isolated. Farm animals have especially put people at risk: cows with tuberculosis, pigs with influenza, and horses with rhinoviruses. Humans can also contract diseases from their pets and even share a few parasites with their furry companions. Even though domesticated animals may cause disease, they played a necessary role in mankind’s history and existence and will continue to play a key part in our civilization.', 'Throughout history, people have bred domesticated animals to promote certain traits. Domestic animals are chosen for their ability to breed in captivity and for their calm temperament. Their ability to resist disease and survive in difficult climates is also valuable.']"
Why are water parks allowed to stay open in states with droughts?,"Water parks are allowed to stay open in states with droughts because they have implemented conservation efforts to prepare for drought restrictions. These conservation efforts include using condensate water collected from air conditioning to power ornamental fountains, and minimising loss through evaporation by replacing a pool’s old canvas cover with a more efficient aluminium roof[4].

Why is there so much meat on chickens when all they do is stand around clucking all day?,"The amount of meat on a chicken is not a result of the clucking, but rather a byproduct of the process of raising the chicken[1].

History of America before Columbus visited?,"Before Christopher Columbus visited the Americas, it was populated by Native Americans, African explorers, and European explorers such as the Vikings[2].

"Why is the environment a political issue, as opposed to a universal concern?","Environment is a political issue because different countries and governments have different policies and approaches to environmental protection, and different political ideologies and values can influence how people view environmental protection. Some environmental problems are more visible and cause more worry, such as water, soil, and ocean and beach pollution, while global warming or climate change is lower on the list[2]. Environmental mobilization is often driven by grievances stemming from environmental ills and disasters, and changes in rainfall and natural disasters caused by global warming can lead to a fusion between conservative interests and pro-environmental ideology[3]. Moreover, socioeconomic status, post-materialist value orientation, education, social class, and income can all influence people's attitudes towards environmental protection[4]. Finally, the mass public is often unsure about the most fair, effective, and cost-effective solutions to environmental problems, and awareness of which behaviors and measures are truly environmentally consequential is low[5].","['In summary, there are reasons to expect that the relationship of political ideology and environmental concern varies across countries. More specifically, it can be anticipated that a number of country-level characteristics such as communist history, developmental state or wealth, and physical environmental conditions weaken or reverse the generally negative relationship between conservatism and environmental concern.', 'Evidence for this comes from approximately three decades of polling on the environment by Gallup. In the chart below, most of the polls took place between 1989 and 2019.14 Note that, over time, the most worrisome environmental problems are visible pollution problems. Water, soil, and ocean and beach pollution are at the top. These are things average people can see and smell. Global warming or climate change is toward the bottom. These numbers change somewhat over time and understandably so, which is why data is included from 2019 where available. People are more worried about climate change than they used to be. Nonetheless, the complexity of the issue compared to the more straightforward cause-and-effect characteristics of other environmental issues is a major impediment to political action.', 'Second, grievances stemming from environmental ills play a big part in explaining environmental mobilization (Brulle, 2000; Martinez-Alier, 2002; Pellow, 2007). Thus, people’s environmental political attitude is likely impacted by incidents in the physical realm. For example, disasters like the explosion of the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl are likely to alter political ideologies towards environmental threats in a profound way (Van Hiel and Kossowska, 2007). Similarly, changes in rainfall and an increase in natural disasters caused by global warming and their adverse impacts on agricultural businesses might lead rightist, profit oriented, groups to focus on environmental protection. Thus, especially in agriculture-dependent countries that experience an economic threat related to environmental degradation, a fusion between conservative interests and pro-environmental ideology may occur.', 'A number of other variables are likely to influence environmental concern. First, socioeconomic status and related factors such as post-materialist value orientation, education, social class, and income have been found to impact persons’ attitudes towards environmental protection. People with post-materialist values, emphasizing the importance of self-expression and quality-of-life, are more likely to support environmental protection than people with materialist values emphasizing physical and economic security (Inglehart, 1990, 1995). People with higher education have been found to be more environmentally concerned than people with lower education, since education provides more information about geographically distant or seemingly abstract environmental threats (e.g., climate change), and evokes greater commitment to the common good (Hamilton et al., 2010; Gelissen, 2007).', 'The surprisingly small research literature on people’s preferences about what to do about climate change, and about other environmental problems, likely reflects that the mass public is itself unsure about the most fair, effective, and cost-effective solutions. Aside from the contentious roles of adaptation and individual voluntary efforts, the policy issues are complex, and laypeople are often unaware even of policies already in place . The externalities driving environmental problems are not necessarily well understood by many members of the public either. Environmentalism in general can come across to many as a sacrifice rather than a means of addressing a costly market failure harming human (and non-human) well-being. Awareness of which behaviours and measures are truly environmentally consequential is low.']"
why does milk that is not treated with rBST have to have an FDA disclaimer about it not making a significant difference?,"Milk that is not treated with rBST has to have an FDA disclaimer about it not making a significant difference because the FDA has determined that all milk contains the hormone BST, and use of the term ""rBST free"" could falsely imply a compositional difference between milk from treated and untreated cows[4].

This is also because it is unclear whether humans can even absorb meaningful amounts of rBST from milk in the first place[5].","['In some ways, this is all a moot point. Why? Well, almost every brand of milk (including generic store brands) has simply chosen not to use milk from rbST-treated cows. Just because the FDA has approved rbST clearly doesn’t mean the controversy is settled. Because consumers prefer non-rbST milk, these brands voluntarily opted to supply it.

They determined that, by asserting that rBST was not used during production and failing to provide further explanation, producers can falsely imply milk from untreated cows is safer or of higher quality.', 'Concern over milk from rbST-treated cows is mostly concern over absorbing rbST from the milk when you drink it.

In-vitro tests use human cell cultures, computer models use data from existing studies, and clinical research studies involve testing a product on human volunteers. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strongly encourages cosmetic companies to employ whatever testing is appropriate and effective for substantiating the safety of their products. In some cases, after considering available alternatives, companies may determine that animal testing is necessary to assure the safety of a product or ingredient[4]. However, in countries like the United States, the European Union, and Israel, animal testing is not legally allowed[2], so companies must consider alternative methods.","['But when a company is trying to introduce a new ingredient with no precedent or safety data to look to, or repurposing a common ingredient for a new skincare use, or needs to know if a certain combination of ingredients is safe, animal testing is a good way to make sure the formulation isn’t dangerous.', 'That means cosmetic companies both in the United States and abroad that choose to conduct animal tests are not legally allowed to sell their merchandise in these countries, forcing many organizations to rethink their methods for testing new products and ingredients.', 'Shampoos, makeup, hair dye, and deodorant are just a few examples of cosmetics that might be tested on animals. Animal testing in the cosmetics industry is typically done to ensure the safety of the products and their ingredients. In most countries around the world, whether products are tested on animals is up to the manufacturer.', '""...The agency has consistently advised cosmetic manufacturers to employ whatever testing is appropriate and effective for substantiating the safety of their products. It remains the responsibility of the manufacturer to substantiate the safety of both ingredients and finished cosmetic products prior to marketing. Animal testing by manufacturers seeking to market new products may be used to establish product safety. In some cases, after considering available alternatives, companies may determine that animal testing is necessary to assure the safety of a product or ingredient.

Why do ultra conservative Christians care so much about gay marriage but don't care about eating shrimp (forbidden in Leviticus 11:10)?,"Ultra conservative Christians care more about gay marriage than eating shellfish because they believe that certain Biblical prohibitions were made null and void by Jesus' sacrifice, so they are not meant to be followed in modern times. They also believe that certain practices, such as eating shellfish, were specifically prohibited by the Bible's culture more than 2,000 years ago, while LGBT civil rights are a modern issue[3]. Moreover, by using the biblical texts to call into question the anti-homosexuality argument, they are effectively undermining the sacred status of their own Old Testament, which can be seen as a sticky theological quandary for them[4]. Finally, they believe that the “God Hates Shrimp” retort does not do anything to expose or undermine their belief on the issue of homosexuality[5].","['But despite the ostensible ability of the argument by shrimp to overcome the challenges of Leviticus 18:22, such a move may actually create more problems, particularly for liberal Christians, than it ever solves. The power of the rhetorical shift to some of the Hebrew Bible’s other commandments lies in the assumption that nearly everyone, regardless of their positions on LGBT civil rights, agrees that injunctions against shellfish and wool-linen blends are ludicrous. What kind of foolish person would believe in such a God?', 'More interestingly, the people who are pushing hardest against gay rights call themselves ""Christians"", not Jews. And all of those Biblical prohibitions were supposed to be made null and void by Jesus\' sacrifice (see, for example, Peter\'s dream in Acts 10), which is why we\'re supposed to be allowed to shave and eat shrimp and all that. (I think this is what the story of Jesus healing the boy brought to him by the Centurion was all about.)', 'Other practices were equally abhorrent to the Bible\'s culture of more than 2,000 years ago. The word to\'eivah is used to revile the eating of shellfish (Leviticus 11:10), a woman wearing men\'s clothing (Deuteronomy 22:5), a man remarrying a woman he previously had divorced (Deuteronomy 24:4), and the practice of predicting the future from signs (Deuteronomy 18:9-12), to name a few. There certainly are religious communities that observe these prohibitions strictly to this day. I, myself, do not eat biblically prohibited food like shrimp and lobster, but I would not want to see those foods banned for everyone. I am quite certain that we will not see religious conservatives filing legislation to ban crab cakes and pants suits as ""abhorrences.""', 'Even beyond its implications for Christian-Jewish relations, the shrimp argument poses a sticky theological quandary for Christians themselves. After all, the biblical texts being employed—and, indeed, ridiculed—by the argument are texts from the sacred scriptural canon of these very same Christians. In using these texts to call into question the biblically-based, anti-homosexuality argument into question, the Christians employing this strategy effectively undermine the sacrality and normativity of their own sacred scripture. While appealing to these texts as examples of the immoral, the irrelevant, or the absurd may have rhetorical value in public debate, it also requires these Christians to dismiss as immoral, irrelevant, or absurd parts of their own Old Testament and undermine its sacred status.', 'This post is written mainly for the benefit of atheists who think that the ""God Hates Shrimp"" retort does anything to undermine or expose the belief, held by evangelical Christians, that the Bible teaches that homosexual practice is a sin.']"

If we need a “seventh” dinner, we have an “every man for himself” night and we have a can of soup, a grilled cheese, make some tuna salad, a box of mac and cheese, or Ramen noodles. We do lots of canned soups for lunches, or take a small portion of left over dinner for lunch. Neither of us are big breakfast eaters (usually just coffee or a glass of juice or milk), but when we do breakfast we eat a lot of oatmeal or pancakes.

Do we sleep for only psychological reasons?,"No, we sleep for both physiological and psychological reasons[1]. Physiologically, sleep helps to clean up brain toxins and consolidate information into memory[1]. Psychologically, not getting enough sleep can increase the risk of developing mental health conditions[3], and it is also the time our mind blocks for mental processing, like recalling new information, as well as emotional processing[4].","['Sleeping impacts many physiological processes, so it is very possible that sleep occurs for many reasons and purposes. In all likelihood, sleep serves a number of different physiological and psychological purposes including cleaning up brain toxins and consolidating information into memory.', 'A lot is still unknown about the purpose of sleep. However, it’s widely accepted that there isn’t just one explanation for why we need to sleep. It’s likely necessary for many biological reasons.', 'Not getting enough sleep skews our ability to regulate our emotions. In the long run, this can increase our risk of developing a mental health condition. In turn, conditions such as anxiety and depression may cause further sleep disruption.', 'Sleep is the mind’s time to rest and recharge. When we get proper sleep, memories, emotions and new information are processed and filed away for our minds to retrieve later on. You know, so you can recall the name of the new coworker that started in your office last week. If you fail to get adequate sleep, well, let’s just hope you don’t run into that new coworker in the bathroom. Because sleep is the time our mind blocks for mental processing, it makes sense why we would be forgetful when we miss out on a good night’s sleep. That’s not all. Sleep is also the time emotional processing takes place. This is why if we miss out on precious rest, we are far more likely to silently curse the car who cuts us off in traffic, or worse.', 'Both eating and sleeping are regulated by powerful internal drives. Going without food produces the uncomfortable sensation of hunger, while going without sleep makes us feel overwhelmingly sleepy. And just as eating relieves hunger and ensures that we obtain the nutrients we need, sleeping relieves sleepiness and ensures that we obtain the sleep we need. Still, the question remains: Why do we need sleep at all? Is there a single primary function of sleep, or does sleep serve many functions?']"
"Does your stomach stop telling you that you are hungry based on the weight of food you have eaten, the volume of it or something else?","Your stomach tells you that you are hungry based on the sensations it experiences when food enters, as well as the hormones it produces when it is empty. When you eat, focus on how your stomach feels through the entire meal. As you become full, the empty feeling will be replaced with a gentle pressure[3][4]. If the fullness is uncomfortable, you have overate[3][4].","['Even though your stomach has a hormonal system for telling your brain when it is empty, this is often augmented by the learned association between times of day and feeling hungry. So, even if you had a large lunch, you may well still feel hungry at dinner.', 'It is true that your stomach changes in size when hungry or full. The stomach contracts as a meal is digested to help move food towards the intestines. It rumbles as air and food move around as food is pushed down, a phenomenon called borborygmus, which is often our first cue that we might be hungry because it is audible and physical. After rumbling, the stomach then expands again in preparation for eating – this is initiated by hormones.', 'Messages from your stomach wall stretching as food enters are instantaneously sent to your brain by super-fast nerve cell transmission. Because of this, sensations in your stomach change with successive mouthfuls, and it is these you want to learn to take notice of. So next time you’re eating a meal, focus on what you are eating as you are eating it, and see if you can notice the changing sensations in your stomach. It helps if you’re hungry when you begin eating, because then the change from hungry to less-hungry is more noticeable. If you can tell when you’re “just full”, great. This is the point to stop eating and go and do something else for 20 minutes, by which time your brain will have had the slower gut hormone information and you’ll probably feel fuller than you did when you stopped eating.', 'Pay attention to how your stomach feels when you are hungry and then to how it feels after drinking a glass of water. The empty sensation should fade slightly within a couple minutes of drinking the water. When you eat, focus on how your stomach feels through the entire meal. As you become full, the empty feeling will be replaced with a gentle pressure. As soon as you feel the pressure in your stomach, stop eating. You should still feel light and energetic with this gentle pressure; if the fullness is uncomfortable, you overate. Relax in front of your plate for several minutes to decide if you are still hungry.', 'On the flip side, it’s possible that when the stomach is empty, the nerves in your stomach can send messages to your brain. This can influence hormones in your body, such as ghrelin. Doctors call this the “hunger hormone” because it stimulates hunger.']"
Why did the concept of evil witches get introduced only since the middle ages and why did so many people suddenly believe they exist?,"The concept of evil witches was introduced during the Middle Ages and became widespread during the early modern period, primarily in northern Europe. This was due to a number of factors, such as the belief that witches were powerful disciples of Satan, the definition of witchcraft as a crime consisting of five elements[2], and the perception of witches as figures who flouted the conventions of normal society and were possessed of powers unavailable to it, at once feared and persecuted[3]. In addition, women were more likely to be accused of witchcraft than men, and hysteria and epilepsy were frequently confused with witchcraft or demonic possession[4]. Lastly, the Enlightenment view that witches were suffering from an irrational delusion likely contributed to widespread belief in the existence of witches, as it failed to take the witch seriously as a person and the disempowerment of those accused of witchcraft[5].","['There was a second kind of witch that instilled fear and loathing in the people of early modern Europe: the significant minority of wealthy people assumed to be witches. In fact, the ‘rich witches’ were rumoured to be the most powerful and most aggressive disciples of Satan. And indeed, we do find a relatively high number of affluent people among the defendants of early modern German witch trials. Rich witches were mostly male and many of them were parvenus who had profited from the agrarian crises in the 16th and 17th centuries. Others were officials who enriched themselves through straightforward corruption. A great number of these people – the newly rich and corrupt officials – were accused of witchcraft.', 'Separate from these real forms of magic, there was the imaginary magic of the witches. Nobody was ever (or could ever be) guilty of witchcraft in the full sense of the word, which was defined by the late Middle Ages as a crime that consisted of five elements: a pact with the devil; sexual intercourse with demons; the magical flight (on a broomstick or a similar device); the witches’ dance (often referred to by the antisemitic term ‘witches’ sabbath’); and malevolent magic. Early modern Europe and Britain treated witchcraft as a capital crime.', 'By assuming that witchcraft and paganism were formerly the same phenomenon, they (Wiccans) are mixing two utterly different archaic concepts and placing them- selves in a certain amount of difficulty. The advantage of the label ""witch"" is that it has all the exciting connotations of a figure who flouts the conventions of normal society and is possessed of powers unavailable to it, at once feared and persecuted. It is a marvel- lous rallying-point for a counter-culture, and also one of the few images of independent female power in early modern European civilization. The disadvantage is that by identifying themselves with a very old stereotype of menace, derived from the pre-Christian world itself, modern pagans have drawn upon themselves a great deal of unnecessary suspicion, vituperation and victimiza- tion which they are perpetually struggling to assuage.', 'Women were condemned as witches more frequently than men. The witch craze took place primarily in northern Europe.1,2 This mentality extended to the New World and witches were burned in Salem in the 17th century (1692-1693).3 Hysteria and epilepsy were the 2 llnesses that were most frequently confused with witchcraft or demonic possession, especially if they were accompanied by tremors, convulsions or of loss of consciousness.', 'In the Enlightenment view, ""witchcraft"" does not ""exist"". A witch or sorcerer is a person suffering from an irrational delusion about invisible powers. The way to deal with the problem is to get such a person (and those who feel threatened by such people) to see that such invisible powers do not exist. The problem with such a view, from a Chris- tian, moral point of view, is that it fails to take the witch seriously as a person. It may be possible to persuade such a person that they have no real power to harm, but that does nothing to deal with the intention to harm, with the hatred that motivated the act. And in many cases it is their very powerlessness that has caused such people to use magi- cal means, because those are the only means that remain accessible to them. It was their disempowerment that caused them to resort to witchcraft in the first place, instead of to explosives or other modern technical means that they had no access to.']"
Why are there people against the development of renewable fuels and energy sources?,"There are several reasons why some people are against the development of renewable fuels and energy sources. One is that renewable energy sources are still in the development stage and investment in research and development (R&D) is often insufficient for them to become commercially competitive with fossil fuels. Additionally, opponents of renewable energy often use the variability of the sun and wind to highlight the need for coal, gas, and nuclear plants, which can more easily provide continuous power[3]. Furthermore, the study found that market failures, lack of information, access to raw materials for future renewable resource deployment, and inefficient energy utilization can all be challenges that hinder the sustainability of renewable energy sources[5]. Finally, renewable energy sources can potentially create unsustainable situations and threaten human societies if not properly managed[1].","['The world’s growing energy need, alongside increasing population led to the continual use of fossil fuel-based energy sources (Coal, Oil and Gas) which became problematic by creating several challenges such as: depletion of fossil fuel reserves, greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental concerns, geopolitical and military conflicts, and the continual fuel price fluctuations. These problems will create unsustainable situations which will eventually result in potentially irreversible threat to human societies (UNFCC, 2015). Notwithstanding, renewable energy sources are the most outstanding alternative and the only solution to the growing challenges (Tiwari & Mishra, 2011). In 2012, renewable energy sources supplied 22% of the total world energy generation (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2012) which was not possible a decade ago.', 'Lack of research and development (R&D) capabilities: Investment in research and development (R&D) is insufficient to make renewable energies commercially competitive with fossil fuel. Both governments and energy firms shy away from spending on R&D as renewable energy is in its development stage and risks related to this technology are high (Cho et al., 2013).', 'Renewable energy opponents love to highlight the variability of the sun and wind as a way of bolstering support for coal, gas, and nuclear plants, which can more easily operate on-demand or provide “baseload” (continuous) power. The argument is used to undermine large investments in renewable energy, presenting a rhetorical barrier to higher rates of wind and solar adoption.', 'In the long run, due to increasing awareness of environmental damage, conventional power generation based on exhaustible fuels (oil, coal and gas) is generally considered unsustainable. Alternative energies that have minimal impact on the environment and are inexhaustible, such as renewable energy, can be a solution to the long-fought sustainability problem. However, despite on-going awareness of the manifold advantages of renewable energy, the diffusion of renewable energy is limited globally. This restriction has been attributed to social, economic, technological and regulatory barriers.', 'The study brought to light the opportunities associated with renewable energy sources; energy security, energy access, social and economic development and climate change mitigation and reduction of environmental and health impacts. There are challenges that tend to hinder the sustainability of renewable energy sources and its ability to mitigate climate change. These challenges are: market failures, lack of information, access to raw materials for future renewable resource deployment, and most importantly our (humans) way of utilizing energy in an inefficient way.']"
"The ability to be vague in the ""ingredients"" list on certain foods","It is often hard to understand what certain ingredients on food labels mean due to the use of vague terms or labels.

Why don't women face criminal charges for making false rape allegations against men?,"Women don't face criminal charges for making false rape allegations against men because false rape accusations are rare and almost never have serious consequences[1].

How did us mammals evolve into having emotions and specifically love?,"The evolution of emotions and specifically love can be traced back to the 19th century and the study of evolutionary theory[2][5]. Love is a difficult emotion to prove in another individual, even a human, which has made its study historically neglected[2]. However, scientists have found that feelings of love are accompanied by changes in the brain's chemistry, which is similar to what animals experience in similar situations[3]. One possible explanation for the evolution of love is that animals need to depend on each other in order to raise young successfully[4]. Finally, Charles Darwin's 1872 work, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, was one of the first to apply evolutionary and natural selection theories to the study of human communication[2][5].","['According to evolutionary theory, different emotions evolved at different times. Primal emotions, such as love and fear, are associated with ancient parts of the psyche. Social emotions, such as guilt and pride, evolved among social primates. Evolutionary psychologists consider human emotions to be best adapted to the life our ancestors led in nomadic foraging bands.', 'On the question of love’s existence in the hearts and minds of animals, science has been mainly mute. Few textbooks on animals discuss the possibility of love. For instance, the word love can be found in neither the index of The Oxford Companion to Animal Behavior nor the Encyclopedia of Animal Behavior. There are, I think, two main reasons for this. First, it is difficult, if not impossible, to prove feelings of love in another individual, even a human. This is the challenge of private experiences. It is why the study of animal feelings in general was largely neglected for the century following the 1872 publication of Charles Darwin’s The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. But humans can at least give verbal expression to their loving feelings; so far, animals cannot, although there is the potential for revelations from language-taught great apes.', "">'In humans, feelings of love are accompanied by changes in the brain’s chemistry…. Animals show comparable biochemical changes in similar situations.'"", '- Depending on others is an ingredient in the evolution of love. Loving feelings are especially important for animals who work together to raise young. The biologist Bernd Heinrich, who has studied ravens for many years, says: “I suspect they fall in love like we do, simply because some kind of internal reward is required to maintain a long-term pair bond.” The pied-billed grebes [pictured at right] have a lot of work ahead of them: these two birds will share the tasks of nest building, incubation, and looking after their chicks, including letting them ride on their backs. Feelings of love could help to keep them happy and content to face the challenges of child rearing. A pair of grebes who didn’t love each other might be less willing to cooperate.', 'The study of the evolution of emotions dates back to the 19th century. Evolution and natural selection has been applied to the study of human communication, mainly by Charles Darwin in his 1872 work, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. Darwin researched the expression of emotions in an effort to support his materialist theory of unguided evolution. He proposed that much like other traits found in animals, emotions apparently also evolved and were adapted over time. His work looked at not only facial expressions in animals and specifically humans, but attempted to point out parallels between behaviors in humans and other animals.']"
How do people become addicted to smoking cigarettes when it is so awful the first few times?,"People become addicted to smoking cigarettes because of the nicotine in cigarettes, which is highly addictive[3][4]. Nicotine binds you to your smoking habit and can be difficult to break[4]. Additionally, smokers may expect their cravings to become more intense until they become irresistible[4][5], which can lead to early capitulation and relapse even if the cravings may not actually become that intense.[5]","['Tobacco addiction could be said to invalidate free will insofar as urges to smoke become irresistible. However, smokers tend to rate their urges as weak rather than irresistible (indeed, as weaker than most other everyday desires). Even the occasional urge described as “irresistibly strong” is often successfully resisted, suggesting that the term “irresistible” is often used in a metaphoric rather than literal sense. Cravings also seem to diminish rather than increase when one quits, and they diminish further as weeks go by. Relapse seems to increase based on frequency of mild to moderate urges, rather than the smoker becoming overwhelmed by irresistible ones.', 'A key insight was provided by Sayette and Hufford (1995) and confirmed by subsequent work. The urge to smoke changes and feels different after one resolves to quit. More precisely, the desire for a cigarette is pleasant to a regular smoker — but becomes unpleasant to someone trying to quit. Other evidence confirms that the actual desire to smoke becomes weaker, not stronger, as soon as one quits (Shiffman, Engberg, Paty, Perz, Gnys et al., 1997). But it becomes unpleasant rather than pleasant, and that is a powerful and influential shift. The implication is that when smokers try to quit, they fail because of the desire for pleasure, not because they are overwhelmed by irresistible cravings. Addiction means that the body has frequent mild desires to ingest nicotine, and when one tries to quit, these become frequent, mild, and unpleasant feelings — that could be relieved by having a cigarette.', 'While I was training to become a family doctor, I learned the conventional wisdom about nicotine addiction. Physicians have long believed that people smoke primarily for pleasure and become psychologically dependent on that pleasure. Tolerance to the effects of nicotine prompts more frequent smoking; when the habit reaches a critical frequency—about five cigarettes per day—and nicotine is constantly present in the blood, physical dependence may begin, usually after thousands of cigarettes and years of smoking. Within hours of the last cigarette, the addicted smoker experiences the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal: restlessness, irritability, inability to concentrate, and so on. According to this understanding, those who smoke fewer than five cigarettes per day are not addicted.', '5 Some people start smoking to numb themselves to relieve their stress. While cigarettes can do quite well in the short term to numb yourself, they may cause you to smoke even more solely because nicotine is so addictive. Some people become stressed and become regular smokers, even if they initially only smoked because of the calming effect the nicotine in a cigarette has. Nicotine becomes a chemical and psychological crutch every time a high-pressure situation arises. Nicotine continuously maintains the withdrawal cycle on the brain and body, which binds you to your smoking habit. This addiction can be overcome by eliminating the psychological reasons for smoking.', ""Flawed forecasting, including beliefs that resistance is futile, may contribute to failures. Many smokers imagine that their cravings are likely to intensify across periods of abstinence, and so they relapse, not because they are overwhelmed, but because they expect to be overwhelmed eventually. In that case, it becomes somewhat rational to give in early. After all, if the endpoint will be the same, why suffer first? Giving in resembles capitulating to one's torturers before the torture commences, simply because one knows that one will capitulate in the end. Smokers are generally mistaken, however, about the expectation that the cravings will mount up steadily until they become irresistible. In that respect addicted smokers are presumably unlike the torture victims. It is however quite unclear whether the addicts' mistake is an honest one, fueled possibly by mistaken extrapolations and media portrayals — or, instead, is a form of self-deceptive rationalization.""]"
"Is it realistically possible to save endangered species or is the planet definitely going to lose turtles, whales, sharks, elephants and many other endangered animals? What's stopping efforts to save them?","It is realistically possible to save endangered species through conservation efforts, such as passing laws to protect and conserve endangered species and creating special preserves as habitats[1], as well as by raising awareness about the plight of endangered species[4] and supporting organisations such as the WWF, who are dedicated to conservation efforts. The Endangered Species Act is also very important, as it helps protect our native fish, plants, and other wildlife from going extinct[5]. However, threats to endangered species include hunting, land development, and the illegal trade of wildlife and their parts, which all make it difficult to save these species.","['""Thanks to concerned citizens and scientists worldwide, many nations have passed laws to protect and conserve endangered species.

A sustainable way to do this is to get involved as a volunteer and partner with governments and organisations – like GVI – on existing marine or wildlife conservation projects.', ""The Endangered Species Act is very important because it saves our native fish, plants, and other wildlife from going extinct. Once gone, they're gone forever, and there's no going back.

"What exactly is buying debt, and how did Occupy Wall Street just do it?","Buying debt is the process of purchasing debt from lenders, usually at a discounted price, with the intention of forgiving the debt rather than collecting on it[4]. The idea behind the Occupy Wall Street's Rolling Jubilee project is to buy distressed debt, such as unpaid loans of people who are late on their medical bills, for less than the debt’s face value and then forgive it[4]. The goal is to provide a “people’s bailout” and to challenge the profit-centered debt system in order to save our democracy[3].","['The group, an offshoot of the Occupy Wall Street movement called Strike Debt, is trying to buy some of the debts that people have accrued — which lenders often sell for pennies on the dollar to third parties who either try to collect on it or bundle it up for resale. Strike Debt, however, is not looking to collect on them; instead it plans to give some debtors the surprise of a lifetime.', ""So if you borrow money, you have debt. If you are struggling to make the payments, the bank may try to sell the debt to someone else if they feel it's a sound financial decision. As far as you are concerned, you still owe the money and such, but to whoever bought the debt. Occupy Wall Street just bought the debt and then basically erased it, freeing the people from financial retardation."", 'The first thing Occupy Wall Street and Strike Debt must do, then, is fransform our understanding of the morality of debt. Is it moral for the 1 percent to extract money from the 99 percent for things like college and cancer treatments? Why should the 99 percent honor their debts when the 1 percent have walked away from theirs without remorse? Framed this way, Strike Debt is not advocating debt “forgiveness”—which implies a benevolent creditor taking pity on a blameworthy debtor—but rather the abolition of the current profit-centered debt system and the development of socially productive forms of credit. For now, refusing to honor immoral debts may be the only way to save our democracy, Strike Debt’s members argue. And as Occupy Wall Street enters its second year, the popular chant still applies: The banks got bailed out, we got sold out. So why should we', 'The idea behind the Rolling Jubilee is simple, and frankly elegant: buy distressed debt for less than the debt’s face value – think unpaid loans of people who are late on their medical bills – and then forgive it. As Occupy put it in a promotional video, now with some 80,000 YouTube views: “Instead of collecting on the debt we buy, we’re going to abolish it. Poof.” Still rankling from the government’s 2008 Wall Street rescue, organizers dubbed the effort the “people’s bailout.”', 'FORTUNE — No more drum circles for Occupy Wall Street — now they’re working with actual drummers. On Thursday the newly reinvented and refocused Occupy movement staged an indie rock star-studded benefit in New York City to launch its new debt-buying project, the Rolling Jubilee. By all accounts, the party was great. It’s still unclear, though, whether the actual plan to buy and wipe out loans will be as successful.']"
"If a person is overweight, why isn't the body's 1st choice to use stored fat for energy, when it is hungry?","When a person is overweight, their body's first choice is not to use stored fat for energy, when it is hungry. This is because the body prefers to use sugar for energy, which is stored as glycogen and released when the person feels hungry[2]. The body can store around a month's worth of energy as fat, but an overweight person may not have enough space to store extra calories, leading to metabolic disease[5].","[""- Your body stores fat as a resource to help protect you against starvation if you can't take in enough food. However, your fat reserve isn't the first place your body goes for food; instead, it reaches out for sugar for energy. Just being hungry doesn't mean your body is burning fat."", ""Hunger is normally a reflection that your body has used up energy from recent food you ate and has moved on to retrieving energy from sugar in your blood. The body stores sugars as glycogen, which it releases when you feel hungry. The more sugars you intake, the more fuel your body has to use before it reaches out to the fat stores. Any carbohydrate you eat is stored as sugar by your body. If your body doesn't have enough sugar to supply the energy it needs, it begins to burn fat when you're hungry instead. Lowering your carb intake reduces the amount of stored sugar in your body, encouraging your body to burn fat when you're hungry."", 'While you can store about a day’s worth of energy in your muscles and liver, an average person (who is not overweight) can store around a month’s worth of energy as fat. That gave us a lot of leeway for finding food.', 'It doesn’t mean you can eat an unlimited amount of fat. Your body still does have mechanisms for storing fat in your muscles and fat cells. But because dietary fat does not trigger insulin, your access to the stored energy isn’t limited by circulating insulin, and you will likely not find yourself as hangry when your body needs energy. You won’t need to take in more energy, you’ll simply use what you have stored—it won’t be locked away by circulating insulin.', 'An important consideration is how much tissue you have available to store fat, which can depend on your genes. “If you don’t have the capacity to make a lot of fat, you won’t have enough space to store extra calories,” Corvera says. “It will spill over into your liver, muscles, and heart. That’s what gives rise to metabolic disease.”']"
Why does certain fast food give us diarrhea?,"Eating fast food can cause diarrhea due to a variety of factors. One is that junk food or fast food is not nutritious for your body in general and can be especially sensitive if you have a sensitive digestive system[1]. Another is that certain ingredients such as artificial sweeteners and highly spiced foods can disrupt the gut bacteria and trigger diarrhea[3]. Eating more than your requirement of fast food can also cause food poisoning, diarrhea, vomiting and stomach aches[4].

what is it about the structure of vegetables that makes them so nutritious yet contain relatively few calories?,"Vegetables are nutritious yet contain relatively few calories because they are naturally low in calories and fat, and free of cholesterol[3].

There are, however, vegetables with a higher nutrient content relative to their calories, making them exceptionally helpful for weight control and health.', '1. The most popular portion plates (editor’s note: a representation of a balanced meal) include fruit in this section as well. Nutritionally speaking, fruit and vegetables are pretty similar in that they both contain lots of vitamins, fibre and water. In a dietary sense, fruit is much easier to eat as a snack rather than include in the main meal, which is why I have labelled this category simply ‘vegetables’.', 'The vegetable group includes vegetables and 100% vegetable juices. Vegetables can be eaten raw or cooked and are available fresh, frozen, canned, or dried/dehydrated. They can be eaten whole, cut up, or mashed.

Vegetables are divided into five subgroups depending on their nutrient content: dark green, red and orange, dry beans and peas, starch, and other. MyPlate recommends a variety of vegetables, especially dark green and red and orange vegetables, as well as beans and peas.', 'Vegetables (and other plants, such as pulses, fruit, nuts, seeds and herbs) are rich in vitamins, minerals, fibre and phytonutrients4, such as antioxidants. Vitamins and minerals keep our metabolism and organs running efficiently, which is essential for staying healthy. A number of vitamins act as antioxidants. These repair tissue damage caused by metabolic processes or some environmental pollutants. Vegetables, herbs and fresh fruit are also satiating while relatively low in energy, meaning they help maintain a healthy weight.

For example, for vegetables, raw, cooked, canned, pickled, leafy green, and legumes are often examined. Fruits and vegetables have also been described as part of a phytochemical group, e.g., carotenoids, vitamin C, or folate (22). Other challenges of determining exposure to fruits and vegetables are that fruits are often consumed as juices and vegetables are often consumed in mixed dishes such as soups, casseroles, and stews.']"
"If mushrooms are made of chitin, a protein, why is the amount of protein listed in the nutritional information so low?","Mushrooms are made up mostly of chitin, a protein, but the amount of protein listed in the nutritional information is low because chitin is an indigestible carbohydrate, which contributes ""bulk"" to the diet but not protein[1]. Mushrooms are also low in calories and contain virtually no fat or cholesterol, and are very low in sodium[1]. When mushrooms are processed into powder or canned, the protein content is increased by the addition of plant and animal proteins[2][3]. Mushroom protein crisps also have higher protein content by adding hydrolyzed animal proteins such as collagen[3]. The protein content in mushroom dry food ingredients is around 22.41%, with an increase to 25% when animal proteins are added[2]. However, mushrooms are generally low in vitamins and minerals[1][5].","['Although mushrooms are classified as vegetables, technically they are not plants but part of the kingdom called fungi. However, they share some characteristics with plants and, as you will find out, even with animals! Mushrooms are low in calories, have virtually no fat and no cholesterol, and are very low in sodium. Three ounces of raw mushrooms, about 1 cup, provide 1 to 2 grams of protein. Mushrooms contain an indigestible carbohydrate called chitin that contributes “bulk” to our diet. Chitin is also found in shrimp and crab shells but not in plants. Mushrooms provide the B vitamins riboflavin and niacin, which are especially important for people who don’t eat meat. Most mushrooms are also a good source of selenium and potassium.', 'Canned mushrooms have been widely marketed and used in the preparation of mushroom soup, stew, and pizza to replace the use of fresh mushrooms [69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75]. Dried mushrooms have been used in instant soup and sauce preparation . However, the dry form of the edible mushroom has limited uses in food production compared to powdered mushroom which has broad application in food developments. The mushroom powder has great potential as an ingredient in various food products due to its functional characteristics. Mushrooms are recognised as an alternative source of good quality protein and are capable of producing the highest quantity of protein per unit area and time from the worthless agrowastes . Based on a study by Salehi , mushrooms contain 22.41% of protein which is higher than the protein in wheat flour. This finding is in line with Wan Rosli et al.  and Mendil et al. , who reported that the protein content in mushroom is around 25%.', 'A minimum protein requirement in the snack should be > 20% to call them as protein snack. The protein content in MPC was increased by externally adding plant and animal proteins from different sources. Hydrolyzed plant protein (e.g., pea and soy) and other animal protein (e.g., milk and egg white) did alter the flavor of MPC. Since there are sizable amount of carbohydrate, fat, mineral and other ingratiates in most of the commercial protein supplements, they mask the flavor of the mushrooms. By incorporating hydrolyzed animal protein (e.g., collagen up to 5% of the mushroom dry weight) obtained from commercial sources, we could increase the protein content without altering flavor of the original mushrooms. Appearance of mushroom protein crisp produced by this method was analogous to the mushroom crisp without adding any external protein supplementation.', 'Due to the expected presence of chitin in the DFI, the content and sugar composition of dietary fiber of the mushroom DFI was determined as non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) by the method of Englyst et al. [35,36], being determined by the sum of sugars released after acid hydrolysis, and quantified by anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) . Protein content was determined by quantification of the nitrogen content of the mushroom DFI after correction for the nitrogen from glucosamine present and multiplication by 6.25. The total nitrogen content of the DFI was determined by the Dumas method. Moisture, lipids and ash content of the mushroom DFI were determined according to AOAC . Total carbohydrates were calculated by difference. Caloric values, on a dry basis, were computed using the Attwater coefficients , corrected for 2% of ash.', 'Another study was performed on the determination of β-carotene (vitamins A); α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol for vitamin E, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), thiamine (vitamin B1), and riboflavin (vitamin B2); and several dominant and trace minerals on selected wild edible mushrooms, namely, Pleurotus sp., Hygrocybe sp., Hygrophorus sp., Schizophyllum commune, and Polyporus tenuiculus. The results revealed that Schizophyllum commune had the highest vitamins A and E for approximately 2711.30 mg/g fresh weight and 85.08 mg/g fresh weight, respectively. For other wild edible mushrooms tested, except Pleurotus sp., vitamins C, B1, and B2 were found mild . According to Keegan et al. , mushrooms generally lacked in vitamin D2. However, they can act as a biological precursor to vitamin D2 due to the presence of ergosterol, a type of sterol predominantly found in mushrooms. Therefore, this feature indirectly makes mushrooms as an excellent source for vitamin D2.']"
"If various species naturally went extinct even without human influence in the past, why is it still important that species are going extinct? Is it not just nature taking its course?","Even though species have naturally gone extinct in the past without human influence, it is still important that species are going extinct because of the consequences of the losses, which are both tangible and spiritual. The current crisis is almost entirely caused by human activities such as habitat loss, introduction of exotic species, and global warming[3], and the rate of extinction is occurring 1,000 to 10,000 times faster than it would naturally[4]. Additionally, research is still being done to determine the extent, if any, of selectivity in past extinctions and to whether the victims of extinction are any different from the survivors[5]. Therefore, it is still important that species are going extinct even though it is considered to be a natural process.","['Each time a species goes extinct, the world around us unravels a bit.

Such an event would occur too infrequently for a person to witness.

In fact, 99 percent of currently threatened species are at risk from human activities, primarily those driving habitat loss, introduction of exotic species, and global warming . Because the rate of change in our biosphere is increasing, and because every species' extinction potentially leads to the extinction of others bound to that species in a complex ecological web, numbers of extinctions are likely to snowball in the coming decades as ecosystems unravel."", 'Ninety-nine percent of all species that have ever lived have gone extinct over the course of five mass extinctions, which, in the past, were largely a result of natural causes such as volcano eruptions and asteroid impacts. Today, the rate of extinction is occurring 1,000 to 10,000 times faster because of human activity. The main modern causes of extinction are the loss and degradation of habitat (mainly deforestation), over exploitation (hunting, overfishing), invasive species, climate change, and nitrogen pollution.', 'Darwin argued that all extinction is selective: species not able to compete with other species die out. In one of the passages quoted above (p. 337), Darwin expressed confidence that if ancient species could be re-created today and put in competition with their modern counterparts, the old species would be ""beaten and exterminated."" This is definitely not the current view, and major research programs are now being devoted to determining the extent, if any, of selectivity in past extinctions. A common (though by no means proven) view is that the victims of extinction are in no way different from the survivors, except for the fact of their extinction. Simpson (1944) was clearly moving in this direction when he suggested in Tempo and Mode that the mammals were the lucky recipients of space vacated by the dinosaurs.']"
How do MOBA's and MOBA style games make so many different heroes and terrains and make the art style match?,"MOBA's and MOBA style games make a variety of heroes and terrains by blending elements from different genres, such as real-time strategy (RTS), role-playing, and action games[1].

However, some MOBA games have certain heroes which control a few specialized units, but not on a massive scale commonly found in RTS games. As is the case in real-time strategy games, structures and base defense are important, and destroying the main structure at the heart of the enemy base typically serves as the ultimate victory condition of a given match.

One interesting way that many MOBAs resemble traditional sports fields (and chess) is that they have a single standard map for all competitive play. LoL has added a couple of variant game types which each have distinct maps, but these aren’t used in professional play so the focus here will be on the core map.', 'The MOBA genre resembles role-playing games (RPGs) in gameplay, though the MOBA genre focuses on the multiplayer battle in the arena-like environment, whereas RPGs typically revolve around a single-player story and exploration of different locations.

Why does meat change colour when it's cooked?,"The colour of cooked meat is caused by the myoglobin breaking down into hemichrome during the cooking process[2][4]. Myoglobin is a red, oxygen-binding protein that is present in the muscle tissue of meat, and it gives meat its distinct pink colour. When exposed to oxygen, the iron atom oxidation level of myoglobin is +2, which makes the meat appear bright red[5]. As the meat is cooked, the myoglobin loses an electron and goes to a +3 oxidation level, resulting in the meat turning brown[5].","['Why do different types of meat get different colours when they’re cooked? Beef turns dark brown, pork light brown and chicken turns white. Most fish are also white, except for Salmon and some other red fish. What makes the difference in the colour?', 'Myoglobin breaks down during cooking and causes meat to be brownish in color when cooked to well done (170+ F). Meat at lower degrees of doneness such as rare (140 F) and medium rare (145 F) has not fully denatured and still provides some red or pinkish red color to the cooked meat. For the most part, this holds true for whole muscle fresh meat purchased at retail, however this is not always the case. The presence of oxygen and the state that the iron attached to the myoglobin protein can determine what cooked color actually appears.', 'The visibility of an uncooked color or persistent pink is influenced by the amount of pigmentation in the meat. Even at the higher end of endpoint cooking temperatures, some of the myoglobin is not heat denatured. At a high pigment concentration, the meat can appear red because a sufficient level of undenatured pigment remains. In contrast, meat with a low level of myoglobin may appear fully cooked even though the same percentage of the pigment remains undenatured.', 'So, why does it turn brown when cooked? Well, at around 140 degrees, myoglobin destabilizes and breaks down into what’s called hemichrome. Where myoglobin gives meat a distinct pink color, hemichrome is responsible for the grey-brown hue of fully cooked ‘red’ meat. This is why a medium rare steak is still quite pink on the inside -- it’s simply not hot enough for the myoglobin to break down. But as you get into the 170 degree range, you’ll find that every bit of myoglobin has turned into hemichrome, creating the well-done look of ‘brown all the way through’.', 'So how does the myoglobin end up making the meat turn brown when cooked? This darkening effect is due to the oxidation state of the iron atoms in myoglobin. When the myoglobin is exposed to oxygen, before you cook the meat, the iron atom oxidation level is +2 and it is bound to a dioxygen molecule (O2), which makes the meat appear bright red. As you cook the meat, this iron atom loses an electron and goes to a +3 oxidation level with this process ending up turning the meat brown.']"
"How can gorillas and other herbavores get so big and muscular from a diet of essentially leaves and plants, while vegan humans tend to loose muscle mass on plant based diets?","Gorillas and other herbivores can get so big and muscular from a plant-based diet because they eat a balanced diet that is designed to maximize their growth and strength[1]. They also consume a significant amount of cellulose, which builds up and turns into the bulk that we see in gorillas and other large herbivorous animals[1]. Additionally, their diet is rich in protein, which allows them to maintain their muscular mass[3]. They also stay active for most of the time, and eat kilos of food per day[1][4][5], which contributes to their muscular mass. Humans may be able to get as strong and muscular as gorillas if they were to mirror their diet and daily activity exactly, however, it is highly unlikely that a human could survive or maintain the same diet as a gorilla[2].","['Herbivores, gorillas, in particular, grow to such a large size because they eat an exceptionally balanced diet that is designed to maximize their growth and strength. However, it is important to understand the most plants are high in cellulose, which is difficult for the body to break down. Therefore, if a gorilla is enjoying nearly 45 pounds of food per day, it is not surprising that they are also consuming a significant amount of cellulose. This cellulose builds up and turns into the bulk that we see in gorillas and other large herbivorous animals.', 'In theory, if you were to look for the most muscular and robust human in the world, and mirror their diet and daily activity exactly, it is probable that you could get as strong and muscular as they are. That said, it is highly unlikely that a human could get to the same bulk and overall size as a gorilla. Quite simply, it is not probable that a human could survive or maintain the same diet as a gorilla, as gorillas mainly eat fruits, leaves, seeds, stems, ants, caterpillars, and termites.', 'The leaves that gorillas mostly subsist upon are rich in protein, which allows the gorilla to maintain their muscular mass. Roughly 16% of a gorilla’s energy comes from protein-rich nutrition, and in the winter, the gorilla will increase their protein intake to approximately 30% of their daily diet.', 'Apart from their biological structure & DNA, these mountain gorillas stay active for most of the time. This constant activity combined with herbivorous food like leaves, stems, bark, fruit and 40 different types of plants that might be one of the key reasons that can explain why these mountain gorillas are so strong & muscular.', 'And as a final bit of preamble, I’m not going to really address some of the sillier things in the film such as comparing humans to gorillas or oxen. The reason that Gorillas get enough protein to be massive while eating almost exclusively plants is that they eat KILOS of food per day. Gorillas-World.com (which are probably a pretty reliable resource for this kind of thing) puts the figure at 18-20kg of plant matter per day (2), then oxen spend most of their day eating and have four stomach compartments which is a little different to our digestive setup…']"
How do animals become domesticated and why are some not able to be domesticated?,"Domestication is the process of humans taking a plant or animal species and transforming it through selective breeding for human benefits, such as creating a ready source of food, harnessing animals for work, or creating pets and companions[1][4]. This is done by taking a wild species and selectively breeding it over 10-14 generations, so that the DNA of the animal is changed due to the selective breeding traits[4]. Animals that are easier to domesticate are herbivores that graze on vegetation, since they do not need humans to kill other animals to feed them or to grow special crops[5]. Some animals, however, are not able to be domesticated because they are too difficult to train, their behavior is too unpredictable, they are too aggressive, they are too difficult to feed, or because they are not social enough.","[""Domestication is when humans take a plant or animal species and, through selective breeding, transform the species into something beneficial for humans. Historically, there have been three major reasons why humans domesticate. The first is to create a ready source of food, such as taking the wild ancestors of cows and turning them into cattle. The second is to harness animals for work, which can range from transportation to use in war, with horses being the most obvious example of this. Then there's domestication that creates pets and companions for humans - dogs are a great example of this."", 'Dogs, sheep, pigs, cows, horses - all these animals and more have been fundamentally changed by humans to make our lives better. Domestication has fundamentally altered the course of human history, reshaping the land and other species to fit our new agricultural lifestyle. But how do you take a wild species and turn them into domesticated helpers? Why can animals like dogs or horses be domesticated while their close relatives like foxes and zebras remain stubbornly wild?', ""As a general rule, domesticated species become smaller and dumber than their wild counterparts. The underlying causes of this are simple enough. Domesticated animals expend little to no energy on gathering food, and while they always have food, it's generally of a lower quality than what they could find in the wild. This means there's no reason for the animals to grow particularly big, although they often become quite fat."", 'When an animal is considered “domesticated” it means that this animal has gone through the process of being tamed and is then kept as a pet or on a farm by humans, and over time these animals may develop traits that make them more suitable for human interaction and use. This is a process that has been going on for thousands of years! For an animal to be considered domesticated rather than merely tame the species must live in captivity and be selectively bred by humans for more than 10 generations. Beyond the 10-14 generations it takes for an animal species to be considered domesticated, the DNA of this animal must be different than its ancestors due to the selective breeding traits will change. For example, a human will only choose to breed the least aggressive of the animals and allow the more aggressive ones to die off. After continuously doing this over many generations, the gene that made the animal aggressive will no longer be present in its DNA.', 'Domesticating animals can be difficult work. The easiest animals to domesticate are herbivores that graze on vegetation, because they are easiest to feed: They do not need humans to kill other animals to feed them, or to grow special crops. Cows, for instance, are easily domesticated. Herbivores that eat grains are more difficult to domesticate than herbivores that graze because grains are valuable and also need to be domesticated. Chickens are herbivores that eat seeds and grain.']"
How come animals can eat off the ground? Does germs not effect them?,"Animals can eat off the ground because they have evolved well-adapted immune systems to fight and destroy the pathogens that would make us sick if we ate their diet[5]. Animals, like people, carry germs in their gut, which can contaminate meat or other animal products[1], and animal waste can also carry antimicrobial-resistant germs which can contaminate fruits, vegetables, and other produce[1][2]. However, the type of food and the surface it lands on makes a difference in how much bacteria it picks up[3], and food poisoning can occur when people eat meat that is still alive with bacteria, viruses, parasites, and other pathogens[4].","['Animals, like people, carry germs in their gut, which can include antimicrobial-resistant germs. These germs can spread between animals and in their environments (such as on farms, in animal markets, and during transport). When animals are slaughtered and processed for food, these germs can contaminate meat or other animal products.', 'Animal waste can also carry antimicrobial-resistant germs. Fruits, vegetables, and other produce can become contaminated through contact with soil or water containing untreated or un-composted waste from animals.', 'The type of food and the surface your food lands on can also make a difference. A piece of wet, sticky food that falls on a tiled floor is likely to pick up a lot more bacteria than a pretzel that lands on a rug.', 'Every living animal, including you, is host to a microscopic ecosystem of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Most of these microorganisms are killed when meat is cooked. But when left uncooked, meat becomes fertile ground for these and other germs within hours of death. This is often referred to as “spoilage,” but spoilage is just the beginning of decomposition. Foodborne illness, or food poisoning, occurs when people eat meat that is still alive with bacteria, viruses, parasites, and other pathogens. Though quite common, food poisoning is also quite deadly, killing roughly half a million people around the world each year.', 'Cats and other carnivores also evolved well-adapted immune systems to fight and destroy the very same pathogens that would make us sick if we ate their diet.']"
Why can't you put a cast on a horse's leg instead of killing it if it breaks it's leg?,"Horses cannot be put in a cast if they break a leg because they cannot handle only using three legs if it was put in a cast[1]. It is also difficult to heal a broken leg in horses because they have minimal chance of recovery and suffer extreme pain[2][4]. Additionally, it is unfair on a horse to try to mend a broken leg, as they will have to suffer discomfort and pain during healing and may end up damaging the other leg due to the heavy load[4]. Furthermore, amputating the broken leg is usually not an option, as horses are heavier and this weight can cause problems for the other hooves, and they must be able to get up and down from a lying position which is not possible with three legs given their weight distribution[5].","['When a dog breaks its leg it is easy to put it in cast for a few weeks and let it heal. A dog will hop along with no problem until it heals. Horses are a different matter. I have been told that they could not handle only using three legs if it was put in a split.', 'Not every horse has to be killed when it breaks its leg, but most do. The reason horses are euthanized when they break a bone in their limb is because they have minimal chance of recovery and suffer extreme pain.', 'This type is much more difficult to heal for many reasons and generally is fatal to a horse. In cases of bad breaks, an animal is quickly humanely euthanized because there simply are no treatment options (such as Eight Belles, who shattered two legs at the fetlock and cannon bone).', ""It's actually quite unfair on a horse to try to mend a broken leg, especially when the chances off it healing well are slim. The horse will have to stand in a stable for months on end (really not suitable for a horse, they need to move, especially to get blood pumping to the feet), it will have to be cross-tied, so it can't even walk around the stable. It will have to suffer pretty extreme discomfort and pain during healing, and it may end up damaging the other leg because of the heavy load."", ""You usually can't save the horse's life just by amputating the broken leg.

"Why do youtubers tend to ask for ""likes"" on their videos, when they get paid per view, and having an uninfluenced like counter could help them produce better content?","YouTube creators often ask their viewers for ""likes"" on their videos because it is a way to increase the viewers' engagement and interaction with the YouTuber, and also to gain higher views and increase viewers' positive brand attitudes[1][2]. It also helps viewers to feel a friendship-like relationship with the YouTuber, as similarity of viewers and YouTubers has a significantly positive effect on the pseudo-social interaction when viewers watch YouTube[1][3][4].

Recommending them to others will also prolong the viewing of the YouTuber’s videos and leave a good impression and evaluation, which has a positive impact on purchase intention.', 'Today, the YouTuber culture of competition on the YouTube platform is becoming fiercer, and the replacement rate is also very high. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to improving YouTubers’ attractiveness and stickiness. The ability to deepen the interaction with the viewers and hit their viewing needs can often gain more viewer stickiness and more positive brand attitude, which is also true in the results of this study. YouTubers must have good interaction and provide accurate content that viewers want to watch, which will help to gain higher views and increase viewers’ positive brand attitudes.', 'In addition, research by Ko and Wu  pointed out that when viewers perceive a beauty YouTuber’s professionalism and ability to provide viewers solutions for their needs, it has a positive impact on viewers’ pseudo-social interaction with that beauty YouTuber. In other words, if viewers found the beauty YouTuber’s task more attractive, they would be more likely to feel a friendship-like relationship with the beauty YouTuber.

"Why do we put so much effort in keeping certain species from going extinct and invasive species out of foreign areas when the more ""natural"" thing to do is let it happen? (read description for clarification)","The effort put in to keep certain species from going extinct and invasive species out of foreign areas is based on two main assumptions. The first is that extinction is a bad thing and that conservation efforts should be made to counteract and perhaps revert the losses[1][2]. The second is that introduced species might become invasive if they are able to outcompete native species for resources such as nutrients, light, physical space, water, or food[5]. Invasive species may drive local native species to extinction via competitive exclusion, niche displacement, or hybridisation with related native species, leading to the loss of biodiversity[3][5]. Therefore, conservation efforts are put in place in order to protect and preserve the native species and their respective ecosystems.[1][2]","['Throughout history, countless species have come into existence only to later become extinct. Whether extinction is caused by natural processes or human agency, environmental scientists and the general public seem to agree that extinction is a bad thing and that, therefore, conservation efforts should be made to counteract, and perhaps revert, the losses. Resources are often devoted to the reintroduction of endangered species into ecosystems in which they have long been absent. In other cases, states implement measures to protect autochthonous species (that is, species which are native to a certain natural environment, as opposed to introduced as a result of human activity) which are threatened by the presence of a foreign species by eradicating the members of the latter. There are entire organisations dedicated simply to the aim of preventing the extinction of species whose continued existence is at risk.

It is difficult to unequivocally attribute extinctions to a species invasion. Although evidence is strong that the recent extinction of about 90 amphibian species can be traced to the chytrid fungus spread by international trade, most scientific research has focused on animal invaders. Concern over the impacts of invasive species on biodiversity typically weighs the actual evidence (either ecological or economic) in relation to the potential risk.[citation needed]"", 'While all species compete to survive, invasive species appear to have specific traits or specific combinations of traits that allow them to outcompete native species. In some cases, the competition is about rates of growth and reproduction. In other cases, species interact with each other more directly.', 'An introduced species might become invasive if it can outcompete native species for resources such as nutrients, light, physical space, water, or food. If these species evolved under great competition or predation, then the new environment may host fewer able competitors, allowing the invader to proliferate quickly. Ecosystems which are being used to their fullest capacity by native species can be modeled as zero-sum systems in which any gain for the invader is a loss for the native. However, such unilateral competitive superiority (and extinction of native species with increased populations of the invader) is not the rule. Invasive species often coexist with native species for an extended time, and gradually, the superior competitive ability of an invasive species becomes apparent as its population grows larger and denser and it adapts to its new location.']"
What does it mean when the ingredients of a food product say “natural flavors” ?,"Natural flavors are flavorings that are derived from plants or animals.

Why is chicken meat so different to pork and beef? Its still muscle right?,"Chicken meat is different to pork and beef because it is much leaner and has a lower fat content. The cuts of meat from cows and pigs that contain the most fat are those that come from areas where the muscles aren't used as extensively, such as the ribs and loins[4], whereas the fat in fish is contained in the oil throughout the body[4]. Chicken, beef, and pork are also composed of muscle fibers, fascicles, myofibrils, sarcomeres, and myofilaments[1] but protein tends to digest faster than fat in the body, so leaner cuts of meat should digest more quickly[5].","['We often hear talk of muscle fibers and the “grain” of meat.

Why have elephants been tamed as war animals in the ancient world but never tamed for domestic things like farming?,"Elephants have never been domesticated like dogs or horses, and are not selectively bred due to their long reproductive cycle[5]. Instead, elephants are captured as adults—especially males—and tamed and trained for their intended functions, as adults require less resources to maintain in captivity[1]. Furthermore, there is much evidence that this process of taming and training elephants is exceptionally cruel[3]. Additionally, preservationist and segregationist arguments have prevented elephants from being domesticated for domestic things like farming, as it was believed that training them for labour would remove them from the very environment to which they were suited[4].","['Central to understanding the history of the war elephant is the fact that, while elephants do breed in captivity, they have never been domesticated. Instead, they are captured as adults—especially males—and tamed and trained for their intended functions. The reason for capturing male adults, with their greater size and larger tusks, rather than raising them from birth, was primarily economic. An elephant from birth requires over 150 kilos of food per day, large amounts of water and medical care to survive in captivity. Since elephants were believed to reach fighting peak at forty years of age, capturing and training adults had great economic advantages over rearing elephants from childhood to adulthood. Capturing adult elephants kept costs down as captured and tamed elephants would be ready for battle as soon as needed.', '-- As tamed elephants are predominantly captured wild animals with wild genes, experts are divided about whether to refer to them as “domesticated,” a term which usually means an animal has been selectively bred.

There is much evidence that this process is exceptionally cruel.', 'Although the elephants were tamed, they were never ‘civilized’. Due to a series of scientific racist ideas, preservationist and segregationist arguments proved more powerful. With domestication proposals deemed unprofitable or impossible on the grounds of race, scientists gathered momentum for the creation of the park by depicting the elephants as a ‘dying race’ that had adapted to the bush over millennia. Such discourse naturalized the bush as their ancestral home and working elephants could hardly be publicized as a spectacle of the prehistoric. The bush itself had supposedly produced their racial peculiarities and training them for labour would remove them from the very environment to which they were suited.', 'Captive Asian elephants are often misinterpreted as domesticated, because they have been kept and trained by humans for thousands of years. However, the majority have historically been captured from the wild and tamed for use by humans.

Can animals tell apart reality from their dreams?,"Recent research in dream and animal sleep has suggested that animals may be able to tell apart reality from their dreams.

Why do healthier versions of a food items cost much more than the unhealthy versions?,"There are several reasons why healthier versions of food items cost more than the unhealthy versions. One is that substitution of commonly purchased supermarket food items with a similar healthier item does not substantially alter the cost of the overall basket of food, but healthier options are more expensive for particular food items such as meat, butter and margarine, cheese, etc.[1]. Another reason is that the gap in price between cheaper unhealthy foods and more expensive but healthier options has grown significantly wider over the last ten years[2]. Additionally, research has found that healthier diet patterns are on average $1.50/day more expensive than unhealthy options[4].

Why did society's view of 'The Future' change from being classically futuristic to being post-apocalyptic?,"Society's view of 'The Future' changed from being classically futuristic to being post-apocalyptic because of the technosolutionist orthodoxy; a belief that technology is our evolutionary successor and that we can transcend all that is human. This shift in perception was driven by business interests that saw new potentials for extraction, and too many technologists being seduced by potential IPOs[2]. The current drive for a post-human utopia reduces all of reality to data, concluding that humans are nothing but information-processing objects[3]. Moreover, the event of climate change has changed the way we perceive, judge, and view things, and is predicated by our relationship to nature and the earth upon which we reside[4]. This has caused the framing of the anthropocene, or better yet the capitalocene, to be based on a set of humans being exploited as natural resources in a system of brutal, complex social forces[5]. As a result, many believe that we are already experiencing the post-apocalyptic in the face of the slow decay that is the climate catastrophe.[5]","['Ultimately, according to the technosolutionist orthodoxy, the human future climaxes by uploading our consciousness to a computer or, perhaps better, accepting that technology itself is our evolutionary successor. Like members of a gnostic cult, we long to enter the next transcendent phase of our development, shedding our bodies and leaving them behind, along with our sins and troubles.', 'Of course, it wasn’t always this way. There was a brief moment, in the early 1990s, when the digital future felt open-ended and up for our invention. Technology was becoming a playground for the counterculture, who saw in it the opportunity to create a more inclusive, distributed, and pro-human future. But established business interests only saw new potentials for the same old extraction, and too many technologists were seduced by unicorn IPOs. Digital futures became understood more like stock futures or cotton futures – something to predict and make bets on. So nearly every speech, article, study, documentary, or white paper was seen as relevant only insofar as it pointed to a ticker symbol. The future became less a thing we create through our present-day choices or hopes for humankind than a predestined scenario we bet on with our venture capital but arrive at passively.', 'There’s nothing wrong with madly optimistic appraisals of how technology might benefit human society. But the current drive for a post-human utopia is something else. It’s less a vision for the wholesale migration of humanity to a new a state of being than a quest to transcend all that is human: the body, interdependence, compassion, vulnerability, and complexity. As technology philosophers have been pointing out for years, now, the transhumanist vision too easily reduces all of reality to data, concluding that “humans are nothing but information-processing objects”.', 'Pessimism and optimism, like so many other eclectic attitudes toward climate change, are merely views; worldviews to be precise. They are lenses with which to view the world and, as such, they are also akin to what Žižek calls event frames (2014). These frames form narratives; shape as well as twist and transform them; they do not, however, alleviate oncoming and undeniable atrocities. Without stating the obvious, it is as such that the event of climate change, which unlike many events which happen suddenly, on the whole, changes the way we perceive, judge, and view things. Žižek, in reference to Heidegger, states that “[c]atastrophe is not our ecological ruin, but the loss of home-roots which renders possible the ruthless exploitation of the earth” (2014: 32). The climate apocalypse began long ago, and was predicated by our relationship to nature and the earth upon which we reside.', 'The way in which the anthropocene, or better yet the capitalocene, is framed is upon the basis of a set of humans being exploited as natural resources in a system that is made up of what Mary Gaitskill, in her humane homage to loss, calls ""brutal, impossibly complex social forces” (2020: 56) . Many believe that we are already experiencing the post-apocalyptic in the face of the slow decay that is the climate catastrophe. If that is the case, and there is more than enough empirical evidence to back up such a claim, then no matter where one stands on the pessimism/optimism divide, the day after the apocalypse is always, and always will be, day one.']"
"Why are certain animals (e.g. dogs, cats) domesticated more commonly than other animals (e.g. deer, raccoons, etc)?","Dogs and cats are more commonly domesticated than other animals because they are more tolerant of people. Dogs proved useful as guards and hunters for the hunting-gatherers[1], and cats arose much later, after humans built houses, farms, and settlements[1]. Also, domesticated animals must be docile by nature[2]. Dogs and cats have one thing in common: they are all tolerant of people, which is why they have been successful domesticates[4]. Dogs were likely domesticated before cats[5], which may explain why they are more commonly domesticated.[2]","['The domestication of dogs and cats (today’s two most popular companion animals) was a bit different from the barnyard animals. And although Darwin began Variation with a discussion of the dog and the cat, the two could hardly be more different from each other (or from contemporary barnyard domesticates) in temperament, utility, and evolutionary origin. Farm animals were food items (“walking larders”) brought into the human sphere at the transition point from hunting-gathering to agriculture (Clutton-Brock, 1999). Dogs, the earliest domesticate, proved useful as guards and as hunters for the hunting-gatherers, and perhaps offered necessary lessons for subsequent domestication of other species (Muller, 2005). By contrast, cat domesticates arose much later (≈10,000 B.P.), after humans built houses, farms, and settlements.', 'Fourth, domesticated animals must be docile by nature. For example, the cow and sheep are generally easygoing, but the African buffalo and American bison are both unpredictable and highly dangerous to humans, so the former two species have achieved widespread domestication while the latter pair have not. Similarly, the zebra, though closely related to the horse, is typically much more aggressive, and this may explain why zebras have been tamed only in rare instances. (Some evolutionary biologists do not consider docility to be a criterion of domestication, as many domestic animals are derived from very aggressive species, such as the dog from the wolf.)', 'About 11,000 years ago, humans realized there was a better place for some animals than the other end of a spear. We started coaxing them into our settlements, gradually molding their natures to better suit our needs for food, labor and companionship. Over the millennia, we dabbled with the domestication of many species. But only a few — most notably, the cow, goat, sheep, chicken, horse, pig, dog and cat — have proved themselves so useful that they have piggybacked their way across the globe, flourishing almost everywhere humans do.', 'Most of today’s domesticates began as food, but all domesticates, including dogs and cats, have one thing in common: They are all tolerant of people. Where, how, and why did this tolerance develop? To understand this phenomenon, we have to step back to a time when humans began living in settled groups.', 'Given the subjective nature of the question, there may never be an answer as to whether dogs or cats make better pets. But in all likelihood, dogs were domesticated long before cats—that is, if cats are actually even domesticated.']"
Why did the Panda species let their genes deteriorate until this bad and how are they still not extinct?,"The panda species' genes deteriorated due to humans fragmenting their natural habitats with road construction, deforestation, and the effects of climate change[2]. As a result, pandas had difficulty breeding and were at risk of extinction. Fortunately, the Chinese government banned logging and the focus is now on adding new protected areas, restoring bamboo forests, and developing corridors of those forests to link the fragmented populations[4]. Additionally, apex predators such as snow leopards, dholes, and wolves that kept taking and boar numbers in check have been reintroduced[5], which has helped to preserve the species.","['We owe it to pandas—and other creatures—to restore their habitats as best we can. But then we should wish them well and leave them alone. If they die out, at least other creatures who are better suited for procreating and sustaining themselves will survive.', 'Obviously, difficulty breeding is not necessarily pandas’ fault. Humans have made it harder for pandas to get it on by fragmenting their natural habitats with road construction, deforestation, and the effects of climate change.', '""If we downgrade their conservation status, or neglect or relax our conservation work, the populations and habitats of giant pandas could still suffer irreversible loss and our achievements would be quickly lost,"" China\'s State Forestry Administration told The Associated Press at the time. ""Therefore, we\'re not being alarmist by continuing to emphasize the panda species\' endangered status.""', 'Fortunately, habitat destruction stopped when the Chinese government banned logging, so the focus is now on adding new protected areas, restoring bamboo forests, and developing corridors of those forests to link the fragmented populations. The National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute team has worked with communities and local reserve staffers to restore bamboos plots, and they have already seen fecal evidence of pandas returning to some of those areas.', 'Giant pandas have very few natural predators, and in the past, animals such as snow leopards, a type of wild dog called a dhole, and wolves kept takin and boar numbers in check. But these apex predators have nearly disappeared, according to a 2020 study co-authored by William McShea, a wildlife ecologist at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, in Front Royal, Virginia. Most died out because of poaching and habitat loss, says McShea, who has worked in China for more than 20 years and argues for “putting these carnivores back.”']"
"how do birds mate, and why can we still eat an egg?","Birds typically mate during the breeding season in the spring[2][3]. During the mating process, birds come together with a ""cloacal kiss"" to fertilize eggs[2]. While some birds mate even when they are not planning to lay eggs[3], most birds only mate during the formal breeding season[2][3]. In terms of why birds still lay eggs, it is because they have evolved to do so in order to reproduce. Although, some domesticated birds and wild birds can lay eggs without mating[1][5]. We can still eat an egg because chickens have been bred to create eggs near-constantly without the presence of a male bird, and their hormones trigger them to lay infertile eggs, which is what humans consume as food[1].","['Birds can lay eggs without mating, though this is much more common in domesticated birds (e.g. chickens) than wild birds.

Birds come together with a kiss, a ""cloacal kiss,"" to be exact, to mate. It\'s a bit different from the way other animals and humans perform this act. While the sex act between birds is only a brief part of the courtship and pair bond—in many cases for a lifetime—coming together in sexual copulation is essential to fertilize eggs to raise young birds.', 'Some birds mate even when they are not planning to lay eggs - eagles are just one example of birds that tend to do this. Most birds do only mate in the formal breeding season, however.', 'Birds don’t give birth because they produce eggs instead. But, most animals have evolved to allow for live birth. So, why are birds still laying eggs?', 'Yes, birds can lay eggs without mating. This is very common among domesticated birds. Wild birds may produce unfertilized eggs as well. But this usually occurs due to complications rather than the absence of a mate.']"
Dietary Effect on Inflammation,"Dietary inflammation is the “black box” that helps us better understand the relationship between diet and how it impacts health outcomes in the long-term[1]. Vitamins and minerals will have a relatively minor effect on inflammation and resolution and the immune response[2]. Research suggests that a diet with appropriate calories that is low in refined carbohydrates, high in soluble fiber, high in mono-unsaturated fatty acids, a higher omega-3 to omega-6 ratio, and high in polyphenols, all have anti-inflammatory effects on the body[4]. Moreover, foods high in saturated fats, highly processed foods, and other foods with trans fat may increase inflammation[5].","['Ultimately, repeated dietary inflammation over several months and years contributes to unfavorable, low-grade, chronic inflammation, atherosclerosis, beta-cell degeneration, and may lead to weight gain.

Why/how does anyone deny climate change.,"Climate change denial is the rejection, dismissal, or doubt of the scientific consensus on climate change, including the extent to which it is caused by humans, its effects on nature and human society, or the potential of adaptation to global warming by human actions[2].

Climate change denial can also be implicit when individuals or social groups accept the science but fail to come to terms with it or to translate their acceptance into action. Several social science studies have analyzed these positions as forms of denial or denialism, pseudoscience, or propaganda.', 'The National Center for Science Education describes climate change denial as disputing differing points in the scientific consensus, a sequential range of arguments from denying the occurrence of climate change, accepting that but denying any significant human contribution, accepting these but denying scientific findings on how this would affect nature and human society, to accepting all these but denying that humans can mitigate or reduce the problems.

why is it that flies seem to appear out of thin air so quickly (even indoors) when rotten things or feces are nearby?,"Flies appear so quickly when there is rotten things or feces nearby because they are attracted to these things as a source of food. They prefer to feed on garbage, feces, and other rotting organic material, and also can contaminate food and surfaces by regurgitating their stomach contents and defecating on them[4]. In addition, blow flies are known for their larvae developing inside the bodies of dead animals, and are often attracted to garbage[5].","['A foul rotting piece of organic matter (from food, to feces, and everything in between) is probably the reason why the house flies are growing at an alarming rate in your home.

They also may contaminate food and surfaces by defecating on them.', 'Blow flies are so-called because the larvae develop inside the bodies of dead animals, causing the carrion to have a bloated appearance. They also are attracted to garbage. Blow flies are about the size of house flies or slightly larger.

Why are lactose-free products primarily targeted towards women?,"Lactose-free products are primarily targeted towards women because research has found that women are more likely to pay attention to their health and are willing to pay more to stay healthy, so they are more reliable customers of lactose-free products[1]. Additionally, the number of new product launches for lactose-free products have significantly increased between 2012 and 2016, indicating the sales growth in the dairy industry[2][3]. The wide availability of lactose-free products has also encouraged consumers to make lactose-free a preferred choice, and the excellent quality of these products has caused households to completely switch to lactose-free dairy when a single member is lactose intolerant[3]. Additionally, the correlation between sex and frequency of consumption is significant, with 71.0% of female respondents consuming lactose-free products regularly, while only 55.5% of male respondents do the same[4]. Finally, 66.7% of those who are personally affected by lactose sensitivity can be considered the target group of lactose-free products, since they (1) are really affected by this problem and willing to pay more for them, (2) regularly consume these products, and (3) consider lactose sensitive labelling also important[5].","['Our findings show that women pay more attention to their health and are willing to pay more to stay healthy, so they are more reliable customers of lactose-free products. This is due in part to the fact that more than half of the surveyed women do the shopping themselves, while most men prefer shopping together with other family members, therefore, women can be considered decision makers in food purchasing. More than half of the lactose sensitive persons declared themselves affected by self-diagnosis, thus, lack of medical diagnosis can also largely affect customer habits, therefore, emphasising the importance of medical examination would be essential.', 'The lactose-free segment drives the sales growth in the dairy industry, as demonstrated by the number of new product launches which have significantly increased between 2012 and 2016 (based on an analysis of the Mintel database ). Globally, the lactose-free claim is no longer only used for niche products; it is, in fact, among the top health claims in new milk product launches .', 'The wide availability of lactose-free products is encouraging consumers to make lactose-free a preferred choice for dairy, driven by the increasingly wide product range. Product diversity is one of the major shifts we are noticing in recent years. Lactose-free is appearing in an ever-wider range of dairy categories. Shelf-stable lactose-free dairy product sales increased only marginally, driven by launches in UHT (ultra-heat treated) lactose-free milk. This was traditionally the only lactose-free option to be found in most countries. However, the increasing number of launches in the chilled section is indicating the move to mainstream where it is easier for consumers to find it—often next to plant-based alternatives.

Regarding the education level, the ratio of non-consumers having higher education was outstanding (15.5%), while the number of regular consumers of lactose-free dairy products was the highest for respondents with high school degree (60.0%), which does not support international findings, saying that consumers of higher-priced functional foods often belong to groups with higher education (De Jong et al., 2004).', 'Therefore, it can be stated that 66.7% of those who are personally affected by lactose sensitivity can be considered the target group of lactose-free products, since they (1) are really affected by this problem and willing to pay more for them, (2) regularly consume these products, and (3) consider lactose sensitive labelling also important.

How does the resonance in a certain room make just a single string of stringed instruments vibrate and get louder and louder?,"Resonances in a certain room cause the vibrations of a single string of stringed instruments to get louder and louder. The strings of the instrument vibrate at a specific frequency based on their geometry (length, mass and tension), and these waves travel through the bridge and the sound post to vibrate the body of the instrument[4]. The air inside the body then resonates with these vibrations and the louder sound escapes to the room through small holes in the body[4]. The bridge of the instrument also transmits harmonic resonances to the surface, which amplifies the sound of the string at the expense of a shorter vibration time for the string. The combination of string, surface, and body cavity resonances also give each instrument its individual timbre[5].","['Your textbook is wrong. Stringed instruments such as guitars and violins do not depend on a specific resonance to make them loud. If they did, then they would only be able to play notes within a certain range of frequencies. Resonances exist, and do modify the response as a function of frequency, but they are not essential to the phenomenon.', 'The problem with resonances in string instruments is that we want the soundboard to be readily set in motion to make a sound (informal resonance), but we want this to happen more or less equally for all frequencies that the strings can produce. The latter requirement means that we want to avoid prominent resonant frequencies, that would amplify some notes at the expense of others. In the end, we end up with a system that does have specific resonances, but they are artistically controlled to ""sound right"", and make the instrument respond to the player. If we try to control unwanted resonances too much, this detracts from the desirable responsiveness of the soundboard amplification.', ""$\\begingroup$ Resonances are essential for the tone and projection of string instruments. That's one reason why the best instruments are so expensive: the more modes of resonance that can be built into the body, the more even the tone and greater loudness the instrument has. It's not easy to make stringed instruments that have proper resonance in their bodies, but science has shown that the resonant frequencies of string instrument bodies are significant factors in the sounds of those instruments. A guitar does still make sound with the hole covered, but it's quieter with poor tone. $\\endgroup$"", 'A stringed instrument is kind of complicated. First, the strings (the simplest part) are plucked or bowed so that they resonate with a specific frequency based on their geometry (length, mass and tension). Almost instantly, those waves travel (mostly) through the bridge (and likely a sound post) to vibrate the body (top and bottom) of the instrument. As the body of the instrument vibrates, the air inside the body resonates with those vibrations and that (louder) sound escapes to the room through small holes on the body.', 'Strings have harmonic resonances at multiples of the fundamental frequency. The bridge of a stringed instrument transmits these harmonics to a surface that has its own resonance frequencies which are usually not harmonic. The surface can move more air than a string and so acts to amplify the sound of the string (at the expense of a shorter vibration time for the string). If the instrument has a hollow body the Helmholtz resonances of the cavity contribute to the frequencies that are present. The particular combination of string, surface and body cavity resonances give each individual instrument its timbre.']"
Why do children often hate food adults enjoy and vice versa?,"There are a few reasons why children may not like the same foods that adults enjoy and vice versa. One is that children's perception of sweetness and bitterness may be different from adults, and it is likely that kids evolved to be standoffish about new foods in order to protect them from poisoning themselves[2]. Another reason is that taste, smell, and texture are important factors in determining what children eat, and good taste, appearance, and texture are the basic requirements of food consumption and indicators of whether a food is eaten or not[1]. Additionally, unfamiliarity with food and even disgust can also affect children's food choices[3], and children may increase their liking for bitter or sour foods if they first encounter them in combination with something sweet[4].","['Koivisto and Sjödén (1996) investigated reasons for liking and disliking foods in 2–17-year-old children and discovered that distaste was the main reason for disliking and good taste the main reason for liking specific foods. Other important reasons children stated for dislike were “texture” and “negative consequences” or they were not able to indicate the reason and responded with “don’t know”. The importance of taste and texture has also been highlighted in other studies [7,8,9], although a review on children’s exposure to healthy foods concluded that liking and familiarity are the most important factors determining children’s food choice. The importance of sensory properties was highlighted as one of the most influential factors determining eating behavior [9,10,11,12,13] and within these, good taste, smell and appearance [7,14,15] and texture  were shown as the basic requirements of food consumption and indicators of whether a food is eaten or not.', 'Does your child insist on eating only a few, favored foods? Does she reject vegetables? Does he refuse to try anything new? It can be maddening, but this isn’t just a battle of wills. Young children’s perceptions of sweetness and bitterness are probably quite different from ours. They may literally taste things that we can’t, and vice versa. It’s also likely that kids evolved to be standoffish about new foods, especially during early childhood. It would have protected our young ancestors from poisoning themselves.', 'The reasons of unfamiliarity, inedible, disgust, unhealthy, bad experience and religion were not very important compared to the sensory properties in the rejection of the food stimuli. However, unfamiliarity was demonstrated to be the second most important reason after the sensory attributes, which conforms with findings that taste and familiarity affect children’s food choices greatly . Research has also established a connection between dislike and the rejection of unfamiliar food [14,59,60]. Unhealthy was the third least stated reason, which contrasts previously conducted research finding that health was one of the most important determinants in adult’s food choices . Children are probably too young to understand what effects the consumption of food or its nutritional value may have .', 'In addition, experiments suggest that kids may increase their liking for bitter or sour foods if they first encounter them in combination with something sweet (Capaldi and Privitera 2008). And studies tell us that kids will eventually accept new foods if we are persistent about offering them — over and over again. But it’s important to present foods in a positive, social context…and to avoid pressuring children to eat.', 'The same seems to apply to bad consequences in children’s rejection of foods. In addition to that, many children did not know and had not tried the stimuli before, which could be an explanation as to why this reason was not relevant for the children. Inappropriateness and disgust were only of very minor importance, which contrasts former research stating that these are one of the main reasons for food rejection in children and adults [5,47]. An explanation could be that the selection of stimuli was considered “appropriate” to most of the children in the present study. Interestingly, disgust was mostly selected for blue cheese and foods from fish-origin (i.e., anchovy, caviar and herring) suggesting that children could be more disgust-sensitive towards these foods.']"
How were structures in ancient times built in water?,"Ancient structures in water were built with a variety of methods. Vertical breakwaters and quays were constructed with large concrete blocks, pilae and arched breakwaters, piling walls, cofferdams, and rubble mound breakwaters[2]. The oldest known port structures were made of ashlar in shallow waters and were used to berth ships[3]. There is evidence of a submerged seawall from approximately 5500-5000 BC in Hreiz, Israel, and the oldest known seaport structure is the Wadi al-Jarf breakwater in the Gulf of Suez, which was built around 2570 BC[4]. During the Bronze Age, corbelled arches and wheels began to be used to move heavy loads, and post and lintel construction was used to build stone temples[5].","['87The ancients often looked for estuaries to shelter from the sea and to find fresh water. In this way, they solved the problem of exposure to waves but fell into another problem: the silting-up of harbours by fluvial sediment. Sedimentation from upstream to downstream in the river, forced the ancients to move port infrastructures further downstream, inducing the construction of an access canal, like in Ephesos, or a diversion of the river by means of a dam like in Leptis Magna. In Neapolis it was worth conducting expensive dredging (Vacchi, 2019). However, 75% of silted ancient harbours were abandoned, like Sharm Yanbu (Saudi Arabia) which might be the ancient Charmotas37.', 'This paper aims to compare ancient and modern port structures hoping that the modern can help us in a better understanding of the ancient, with special focus on breakwaters and quay walls. The oldest known port structures are briefly presented. Vertical breakwaters and quays, large concrete blocks, pilae and arched breakwaters, piling walls, cofferdams, rubble mound breakwaters and river training walls are described in the ancient and in the modern world. A few geomorphological aspects of coastal harbours are also reviewed.', '19It can be seen from the list above that most early maritime structures were vertical and made of ashlar in water depths not exceeding a few meters. This can be explained by the small draught of ancient ships (i.e., ca. 1-2 m for navy ships and up to 3-4 m for freighters) and the fact that breakwaters were used not only to reduce wave action inside a protected basin, but also to berth ships10.', '8A submerged probable-seawall dated ca. 5500-5000 BC was found at Hreiz (Israel) (Galili, 2019). The oldest known seaport structure (in 2021) is the wadi al-Jarf breakwater in the Gulf of Suez (ca. 2570 BC, Khufu-Cheops). This structure is ca. 325 m long and ca. 6 m wide (Tallet & Marouard, 2016). Khufu-Cheops is therefore a precursor, not only for his Great Pyramid, but also for his maritime works. The port of Byblos (Lebanon) is from the same period, but it is located inside natural coves with no known port structures (Carayon, 2012a). Between 2400 and 2000 BC, a 4 m deep basin of 215 x 35 m was built with fired mudbrick at Lothal (India) near River Sabarmati, but this may have been a water reservoir. The smaller harbour basins of Ur were probably also built in this period (Woolley, 1974: plate 61, Blackman, 1982, Oleson, 2015).', 'During the Bronze Age the corbelled arch came into use such as for beehive tombs. The wheel came into use but was not common until much later. Heavy loads were moved on boats, sledges (a primitive sled) or on rollers. The Egyptians began building stone temples with the post and lintel construction method and the Greeks and Romans followed this style.']"

This clash of worlds echoes a broader battle currently unfolding in society: between those attached to the modern ideals of infinite growth and progress, and others who see the latter’s material impossibility. This opens critical questions for our collective imagination, including the need for a bifurcation: away from the modern imaginary, which has caused the climate crisis in the first place (Chakrabarty 2018), and towards the terrestrial (Latour 2018) in order to live within the Earth’s boundaries.', '""At this point, the inexorable increase in global temperatures is entirely predictable,"" said Sarah Green, an environmental chemist at Michigan Technological University.

"What ""Babylon"" means in Rastafari culture?","In Rastafari culture, Babylon refers to the oppressive forces of colonialism and its legacies, which are seen as corrupted, capitalist, and exploitative[2][4].

Babylon is believed to actively seek to exploit and oppress people, especially people of African descent, and forbid the use of ganja, as it opens people's minds to the truth[2]. The Rastafarian ideology is often in contrast to the materialistic nature of Ancient Babylon[1][2][4][5].","['The concept of Babylon plays a central role in Rastafarian Ideology: There is only one other word Rastafarians use with more frequency and passion, and that is the name of their Majestic Ruler, Haile Selassie. People who have even a mild interest in reggae understand what""Babylon""means, yet the roots of the word""Babylon""remain unknown to the masses. To gain a better understanding of this term, it is necessary know the full history of Babylon, which starts 6000 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia.', ""Rastafarian word referring to The State and The System: it refers equally to the British Empire which engineered the slave trade and to the modern oppressive governments of the USA and her allies, as they are considered to be one and the same imperialist evil. It's believed that the Babylon actively seeks to exploit and oppress the people of the world, especially people of African descent. It's believed that the Babylon forbids the smoking of ganja because this sacred herb opens men's minds to the truth. The term is a reference to the fact that in the Torah (AKA the Old Testament) the Babylonian Empire forcibly relocated the Jews from the Land of Israel to the city of Babylon, where they were forced to stay for around 50 years. This situation is seen as analogous to the forced deportation of Africans to the Americas by Europeans.

This delegitimation is expressed as “beating down Babylon,” and is accomplished by condemning Jamaica and the West for its historical atrocities, economic exploitation, mental slavery or cultural imperialism, and political trickery. The attempt to revitalize African culture and sensibilities focuses on the reappropriation of Africa as the spiritual and cultural home of Rastas and all Africans in the Diaspora, on the lion as the symbol of Rastafarian self‐assertiveness and confidence in response to the coward Anancyism of alienated slave personality, and on the cultivation of dreadlocks, “dread talk,” and “ital levity” (natural or organic living).', 'The materialistic nature of Ancient Babylon provides us with sharp contrasting element to the Rastafarian Ideology.

What do philosophers mean by we don't have free will?,"Philosophers generally mean that we don't have free will when they argue that our choices are predetermined and we don't have a say in how we act[1]. This view can be traced back to ancient Greek philosophical literature, where it was argued that our will is not free because nothing hinders us from doing or choosing something[3]. The term ""free will"" was introduced by Christian philosophy in the 4th century CE and has traditionally meant the lack of necessity in human will[4]. Philosophers debate whether free will is a specific faculty of an agent's will, or just shorthand for other features of persons, and whether it really exists at all[5].","['But before we ask ourselves whether we have free will, we must understand what exactly we mean by it. A common and straightforward view is that, if our choices are predetermined, then we don’t have free will; otherwise we do. Yet, upon more careful reflection, this view proves surprisingly inappropriate.', ""You might think, ‘I am consciously deciding to read this article, and if you or Sam Harris continue to baselessly claim I have no agency I might just stop.’ Well, here at Philosophy Break we hope you don't stop — but according to the viewpoint under discussion neither you nor we (nor even Sam Harris) has any bearing over whether or not that actually happens. You have no choice in how you act. You have will — but it is not free."", 'The problem of free will has been identified in ancient Greek philosophical literature. The notion of compatibilist free will has been attributed to both Aristotle (fourth century BCE) and Epictetus (1st century CE); ""it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them"". According to Susanne Bobzien, the notion of incompatibilist free will is perhaps first identified in the works of Alexander of Aphrodisias (third century CE); ""what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them"".', 'The term ""free will"" (liberum arbitrium) was introduced by Christian philosophy (4th century CE). It has traditionally meant (until the Enlightenment proposed its own meanings) lack of necessity in human will, so that ""the will is free"" meant ""the will does not have to be such as it is"". This requirement was universally embraced by both incompatibilists and compatibilists.', 'Most of us are certain that we have free will, though what exactly this amounts to is much less certain. According to David Hume, the question of the nature of free will is “the most contentious question of metaphysics.” If this is correct, then figuring out what free will is will be no small task indeed. Minimally, to say that an agent has free will is to say that the agent has the capacity to choose his or her course of action. But animals seem to satisfy this criterion, and we typically think that only persons, and not animals, have free will. Let us then understand free will as the capacity unique to persons that allows them to control their actions. It is controversial whether this minimal understanding of what it means to have a free will actually requires an agent to have a specific faculty of will, whether the term “free will” is simply shorthand for other features of persons, and whether there really is such a thing as free will at all.']"

"If we have to help animals like horses give birth, then how did they manage it themselves before humans started animal husbandry?","Before humans started animal husbandry, horses were able to give birth on their own as they are a precocial species, meaning that the newborn foals are neurologically mature at birth[4]. Humans have been involved in the domestication of animals since 8,000 BCE[3], and traditionally, animal husbandry was part of the subsistence farmer’s way of life[5]. This meant that humans would raise animals for their products such as wool, eggs, milk and blood, as opposed to killing the animals for food. The domestication of animals allowed humans to harness the muscle power of cattle, donkeys and horses, which increased the efficiency of farming and ultimately contributed to the rise of cities[3]. Horses were also tamed and trained by cowboys and other horse experts, a process which is sometimes known as ‘breaking’ a horse[2].","['The taming of wild animals to live and work with people dramatically increased the amount of energy available to humans.

Goats and sheep were tamed and raised for their meat, milk and hides (in the case of sheep, wool). By 6,000 BCE, humans had started to tame the wild ox, or aurochs, an animal that lived throughout much of Asia and Europe. Domesticated cattle proved to be much more versatile than goats or sheep: in addition to providing food, milk, and hides, cattle could be harnessed to till fields using early versions of the plow. The muscle power of cattle, and later donkeys and horses, dramatically increased the efficiency of farming, allowing for greater crop yields that supported larger populations and ultimately contributed to the rise of cities.', '10.

why are weapons used to hunt animals always piercing but those used to kill men could be hacking/slashing as well?,"Piercing weapons are typically used to hunt animals because they are less likely to hew off limbs and more likely to destroy organs, leading to a quicker and more efficient kill[1][2][3].

Why do they not like renewable industries?,"Conservatives tend to cling to the fossil fuel industry because they view it as a source of economic prosperity. They are confident in the fossil fuel industry's ability to remain an important economic driver in the future, which can undermine support for climate policies because people do not perceive a need to turn to alternative industries for economic prosperity[1]. Conservatives also oppose the transition to renewable industries because the price of fossil fuels is kept artificially low, making it difficult to compete with fossil fuels[5].","['We expand on ongoing debates about the role of economic losses and benefits for a clean energy transition. Rather than focusing on the potential economic benefits of alternative industries and energy sources, we highlight the role of economic optimism people display towards the fossil fuel industry. We argue that people’s confidence in the fossil fuel industry to remain an important economic driver in the future can undermine support for climate policies because people do not perceive a need to turn to alternative industries for economic prosperity. Instead, they continue to support the status-quo. We test our argument using survey level data collected in the spring of 2019 in the Canadian province of Alberta, an ideal case due to the province’s economic dependence on the fossil fuel industry. The results support our argument, highlighting the need for policymakers to develop communication strategies on future economic benefits of energy transition.', '“The Republican response is predictable and pathetic. It is from a very old playbook,” said Judith Enck, who was a regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency under Barack Obama. “The party will cling to fossil fuels to the bitter end. It’s so sad because so many Republican voters are damaged by climate change, if you look at deaths from the heat or wildfires we are seeing in California. But the party right now is just completely beholden to the fossil fuel industry.”', 'Yet, the picture remains incomplete without paying attention to the expected economic benefits, through jobs or tax revenues (Mayer and Malin 2019), to a region from the continued presence of incumbent companies in the fossil fuel sector. The core of our argument is that as long as people are confident that the incumbent fossil fuel companies can continue to deliver wealth and economic benefits to their communities or regions by retaining their fossil fuel business, the incentive to support policies that would facilitate a transition to a low-carbon economy remains low. In other words, a positive belief in the future economic benefits of existing fossil fuel industries manifests itself in the support of the status-quo and the opposition to a low-carbon industry transition.', 'To clarify, we do not imply that those who hold these beliefs automatically support climate policies if they were not to expect any future economic gains. Rather, these beliefs lead to more general support of the status quo over change. This implication is consistent, for example, with evidence from the United Kingdom, which suggests that residents of regions with high employment levels in the oil and gas sector do not support the expansion of fracking in their regions (Roddis et al. 2019, p. 9). The results thus point towards a broader resistance to change in general, including expanding both high-carbon and low-carbon industries. Considering how the fossil fuel industry has been at the core of economic development in many countries, regions, and communities alike, the rejection of change should reduce support of an energy transition, including one towards a low-carbon economy.', 'The transition has been sluggish because the price of fossil fuels is kept artificially low. Consumers and businesses do not pay the full cost of the climate, health, and other related costs of fossil fuel use. This could be largely solved by making consumers pay the full cost of their energy through a carbon tax or cap and trade system. If society had to pay the full costs of energy, fossil fuels would quickly disappear from the energy market.']"
How did people deal with painful teeth issues like Wisdom teeth before modern dentistry?,"Before modern dentistry, people had to rely on a variety of methods to deal with painful teeth issues like wisdom teeth. It was believed by many cultures that the toothache was caused by a fictional creature called a tooth worm[2], while others believed that wisdom teeth evolved to replace teeth that were worn out with chewing an abrasive diet[3]. People had to either travel to see a dentist or simply hope the pain would subside[5], and even if a dentist was available, the procedures available may not have been grounded in any scientific basis. In some cases, wisdom teeth impaction could cause problems[5], but in general wisdom teeth were essential for our ancestors as they needed them to grind down on bone and chew extremely tough food[1].","['Before modern dentistry, wisdom teeth were essential.

Why do anti-smoking companies spend so much money on commercials?,"Anti-smoking companies spend a lot of money on commercials in order to reach a wide audience and create a more positive public opinion about their company. These ads are often modified by the tobacco companies to weaken anti-smoking messages[1][2], and are usually limited to magazine ads and other non-broadcast media due to restrictions on advertising[3]. Anti-smoking campaigns are most effective when they evoke strong emotions and realistically depict the health consequences of smoking[4], and include testimonials from former smokers about why individuals shouldn't smoke[5].","['This study demonstrates that industry sponsored anti‐smoking ads do more to promote corporate image than to prevent youth smoking. By cultivating public opinion that is more sympathetic toward tobacco companies, the effect of such advertising is likely to be more harmful than helpful to youth.', 'Shete: Through years of litigation, the tobacco companies substantially modified the original, more potent version of the ads before they were released, weakening the anti-smoking messages. For example, the tobacco companies successfully fought to have the phrase “here is the truth” removed from the ads. When tobacco companies advertise pro-smoking messages, those ads are quite visually appealing. However, their anti-smoking ads are less engaging. The goal of these ads should be to sustain viewers’ attention, not to bore them. The media landscape has also changed since the 2006 court ruling that ordered these ads. Social media is more prevalent now and should be included in future anti-smoking campaigns.', 'American cigarette manufacturers spent more than $8 billion on advertising and promotional expenses in 2014, according to the Federal Trade Commission, though the vast majority of that was through price discounts. That year, they spent $50 million on magazine ads, while newspaper spending was too limited to report. The companies are not allowed to advertise on broadcast TV.', 'Research indicates the most effective anti-smoking media campaigns evoke strong emotions and realistically depict the terrible health consequences of tobacco use – just as the CDC ads do. We applaud the CDC for its strong leadership in the fight against tobacco use. We also thank the courageous former smokers who shared their heartbreaking health struggles with the entire country, telling the harsh truth about how devastating and unglamorous cigarette smoking truly is.', 'Chido-Amajuoyi: Another way these ads differ from more successful anti-smoking campaigns, such as Tips From Former Smokers®, is the lack of testimonials from people who used tobacco and now have cancer or other health problems. Future industry anti-smoking campaigns should include first-hand perspectives from former smokers about why individuals shouldn’t smoke.']"
why are we typically less attracted to fat people?,"We are typically less attracted to fat people because of the pervasive cultural beliefs that thin people are inherently desirable and fat people are categorically undesirable[1][2][3][4]. This has led to the idea that any attraction to fat people must speak to a darker urge or unchecked appetite[3]. Furthermore, many fat people have internalized these stereotypes, leading to binge eating, and survivors of sexual assault may also find it difficult to accept any desire for them as it reinforces messages of worthlessness. Additionally, we live in a culture where desiring fat people is seen as something deviant to be hidden and shamed[5].","['Of course, not all fat people have lived these sex and relationship horror stories. But many of us have become so acculturated to them that we come to describe the vast majority of fat attraction as fat fetishism. When fat sex and dating are discussed, there’s rarely room for simple attraction. But thin people are frequently attracted to other thin people without garnering suspicion of fetishism. They may find themselves drawn to brown-haired people, muscle-bound bodies, or tall partners. They can speak freely of the physical characteristics they like best: chiseled jawlines, long hair, slim legs. In the world of thin people, these are types, a physical attraction so universal that it is neutral.', 'While Ogas and Gaddam’s research speaks only to sexual desire (not romantic attraction or aspirations), it certainly indicates that our cultural scripts around size and desire — that is, that thin people are inherently desirable and fat people are categorically undesirable — are rooted more in perception than in research. The findings in A Billion Wicked Thoughts point to the idea that fat bodies may be among the most widely desired, but that desire may be repressed, possibly due to pervasive stigma.', 'Everyone, we are told, has a type. But if a thin person is reliably attracted to fat people, that type curdles and becomes something less trustworthy: a fetish. Fat people are so categorically undesirable, we’re told, that any attraction to us must speak to a darker urge or some unchecked appetite.', 'Fat fetishism has deep roots for many fat people, especially fat women. For some, size, desire, shame, and sex are a rat’s nest, hopelessly entangled. People who internalize anti-fat stereotypes — including the pervasive cultural belief that fat people are categorically unattractive or unlovable — are more likely to binge eat, as are survivors of sexual assault. Fat acceptance spaces frequently include heartbreaking stories of people whose partners kept their relationships secret. Worse still, some tell stories about working up the courage to share their experiences of sexual assault only to be categorically disbelieved. Given the pervasiveness of their experiences, is it any wonder that some fat people come to experience anyone else’s desire for them as predatory?', 'Then, on top of all that, messages like these. Messages that received my body like tissue: plentiful, accessible, disposable, trash. Fat people aren’t the only ones who live with the repercussions of anti-fatness in our relationships. Those messages also land hard with people who date us, love us, marry us, sleep with us. They get trapped, too. After all, in our cultural scripts, a fat partner is a failure at best, a shameful, pathological fetish at worst.

How much electricty would you need to apply to the ocean to harm animals in a larger scale?,"It is difficult to determine exactly how much electricity would need to be applied to the ocean to harm animals on a large scale, as the impacts vary depending on the type of device used and the environment. For example, chemicals used in anti-corrosion coatings or grease for machinery can leak into ocean waters and the moving parts of devices can harm resident or migratory wildlife[1]. Additionally, electromagnetic fields generated around cables can cause changes in behavior, migration or reproduction[1], while noise from devices can interfere with behavior and affect hearing or nerves[1]. Furthermore, large-scale wave energy converting devices may have impacts on local currents and ocean temperatures, which could affect the entire ecosystem. However, research has shown that up to 4 times more wind power per square meter can be extracted from open ocean farms than current land-based techniques[5], and that 3 million wind turbines in the North Atlantic ocean could produce 18TWh of energy[2][5], so it is possible to generate large amounts of energy from the ocean with minimal environmental impact.","['There are also environmental impacts to consider. Chemicals used in anti-corrosion coatings or grease for the machinery can leak into ocean waters. The moving parts of devices can harm resident or migratory wildlife; and even static installations can alter breeding and feeding behavior if animals try to avoid the devices. Entanglement in cables or moorings is also a threat to wildlife. The electromagnetic fields generated around cables can cause changes in behavior, migration or reproduction. Noise from devices can also interfere with behavior and affect hearing or nerves, as sound travels easily in water. Lighting on devices, needed to guide ships or planes, might attract creatures, impacting normal behavior.', 'A new study postulates that 3 million km2 of open ocean area in the windy North Atlantic could produce enough energy to satisfy the needs of the entire human species during the winter months, while it could cover the electricity needs of North America and Europe during the summer.', 'Brekken and his colleagues studied the environmental impacts of wave energy converting devices such as leaks of oil, electromagnetic fields, the physical device itself and mooring lines. And because anything that sits in the water gets colonized, they looked at the impact of “biofouling” on the behavior of local marine life. “There was no single thing that we found that had a deeply concerning environmental impact,” he said. “The effects were pretty typical of other marine vessel issues, like boats and navigational buoys. So the strategies to deal with the impacts are similar…such as bringing things to dry dock to clean them off, or burying or shielding lines to deal with the electromagnetic fields.”', 'Lackner is concerned about the impacts of altering local currents upon which entire ecosystems might be based. “By the time you pull some fraction of energy out of the waves, you will have an effect on the ocean currents,” he said. “Whole areas could be affected. Waves come from a long way away. If you intercept them halfway, say at Hawaii, waves at the shore will be smaller. … And with ocean thermal energy, you are bringing cold water to the surface, changing the conditions of the surface, which will have impacts on nutrients and carbon dioxide.”', 'The researchers found that up to 4 times more wind power per square meter can be extracted from open ocean farms than current land-based techniques. With this increased wind intensity, it was discovered that 3 million wind turbines, each placed in its own 1 sq kilometer area, in this North Atlantic ocean could produce an annual amount of 18TWh of energy – equivalent to humanities current needs.']"
Why do humans generally avoid eating other predators?,"Humans generally avoid eating other predators as they have not evolved ways to successfully avoid humans or reproduce fast enough to make up for human-induced losses[2]. Additionally, predators living in areas heavily populated by humans have learned to become wary of humans[3]. This fear of humans could also help prevent conflict between humans and wildlife[4]. Lastly, carnivores do kill and eat other carnivores, but this is usually an act of dominance, rather than for food[5].","[""Most animals face the risk of being eaten. It's hard to pass on your genes when you're dead; therefore, the threat of predation imposes strong selective pressure on organisms, resulting in a myriad of behavioral strategies that allow them to survive. To avoid becoming someone's dinner, an organism must be able to identify predatory threats and employ effective strategies to avoid detection by predators. In the event that avoidance fails, animals can use behaviors designed to prevent predators from attacking, and have tactics that will increase their chances of surviving attack if it does occur."", ""After a decade compiling and analyzing about 300 studies, the team came to some grim conclusions, says Chris Darimont, a conservation scientist also at the University of Victoria who helped lead the study. Humans and other predators—like lions, wolves, and grizzly bears—kill wild herbivores at about the same rate, but humans kill large carnivores at nine times the rate of other predators, Darimont, Reimchen, and their colleagues report today in Science. We kill those carnivores not for food, but for trophies and—sometimes—to eliminate them as competitors, Darimont says. Because they naturally don't face much predation, they have not evolved ways to successfully avoid humans or reproduce fast enough to make up for human-induced losses."", 'Predators living in other areas that are heavily populated by humans have faced similar problems. According to Suraci, the animals that have escaped human menace likely learned to become wary of our species. ""For very logical reasons, some of these larger predators have a healthy fear of humans in the same way that any prey species would fear its predators,"" Suraci said.', 'Suraci thinks this fear that predators have of humans could also have an upside: It could help prevent conflict between humans and wildlife. Large predators need a lot of space, and in a human-dominated world, they need to be able to live alongside humans without conflict.', 'Yet carnivores do kill and eat other carnivores. A lot of the time the consumption of a rival is an act of dominance, particularly among lions.']"
"Beef farmers, is the fatter the cow, the better? Or is there a limit beyond which the meat has such high fat content it's market value starts reducing?","It is important to consider both the market value and the nutritional content of beef when it comes to fattening cattle. Generally speaking, the fatter the cow, the higher the fat content of the beef, and thus the lower the market value. There is also a difference in the fat content between grass-fed and grain-fed beef, with grass-fed beef containing less total fat than grain-fed beef, but more omega-3 fatty acids and CLA[3]. Additionally, beef cattle raised on deforested land result in much higher greenhouse gas emissions and use more land than those grazing rich natural pasture[4], and the nutrient composition of the beef is significantly affected by what the cow eats[5]. Therefore, there is a limit beyond which the meat has such high fat content that its market value starts reducing.","['While ruminants have the distinct ability to convert cellulose into muscle protein through ruminal microbial fermentation, there remains a history of fattening cattle on feedstuffs other than forage long before the establishment of the modern confinement feedlot industry. Early fattening in America included root crops, “Indian corn”, tree fruits and brewing and distillery mash. Confinement feeding in early America also was a mechanism to concentrate manure for fertilizer. Unlike forage-finishing, grain-finishing requires less land. Depending on soil type and topography, as little as 150 square feet per calf of pen space with a feed and water trough is sufficient. Sometimes, locally grown beef producers may allow a much larger area to keep grass cover in the lot instead of allowing the pen to become a dirt lot.', 'Grass-fed beef usually contains less total fat than grain-fed beef, which means that gram for gram, grass-fed beef contains fewer calories (2).', 'Grass-fed beef may contain less total fat than grain-fed beef, but a lot more omega-3 fatty acids and CLA, which are both linked to health benefits.', 'The analysis also revealed a huge variability between different ways of producing the same food. For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land result in 12 times more greenhouse gases and use 50 times more land than those grazing rich natural pasture. But the comparison of beef with plant protein such as peas is stark, with even the lowest impact beef responsible for six times more greenhouse gases and 36 times more land.', 'What a cow eats can significantly affect the nutrient composition of its beef. This is particularly evident when it comes to fatty acid composition.']"
Why did it take European leaders a year to finally confront Putin?,"European leaders took a year to finally confront Putin due to a number of issues. For one, there was a divide among Europeans on how to approach their relationship with Russia, as well as uncertainty over what the longer-term relationship should look like and how to handle relations with China[1]. Additionally, Europeans had to address their energy dependence and uphold a strict sanctions regime[1] while avoiding diplomatic engagement with Putin that could be seen as a sign of isolation from the West[2]. This was further complicated by the fact that the EU-Russia relationship had been built on economic and energy interdependence for the past three decades, and the EU was now cutting all economic ties with Russia[3]. Furthermore, there were gaps in the multilateral institutions at the heart of the alliance – NATO and the European Union – that were not built for crisis response[4], and the future of Europe was contingent on the West's response to Putin's actions[2][5].","['But the main questions facing Europeans will linger long beyond this season. Russia and the West will remain in an adversarial relationship for some time to come; and EU leaders will need to learn to navigate this new reality. Europeans have no fixed view yet of what the longer-term relationship with Russia should look like, or what model of European order they want to shape. Nor do they yet know how to approach their relationship with China in the global web of power relations, in which Russia holds a central place. They have, however, identified their near-term priorities: addressing their energy dependence and upholding a strict sanctions regime. Such actions contain glimpses of what a stronger and more sovereign Europe looks and acts like. This will not be what Putin had in mind in February 2022 – but the violence he has unleashed may now hasten its entry onto the world stage.', 'Policymakers across the EU also harbour no illusions about the EU’s own mediation capacity. Early on in the war, the question of outreach to Putin was an issue that divided Europeans – eastern Europeans were furiously critical of President Emmanuel Macron’s and Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s phone calls to Moscow, assuming that Putin would regard these as a sign that Russia was not isolated. These differences were reflected in the survey, and the passions around them still flare up every now and then. Such was the case recently when Macron stated that the future political order needs to involve “security guarantees to Russia”, he was widely criticised in eastern European countries. Overall, though, it seems to be increasingly evident that neither diplomatic engagement nor a sense of isolation from the West will, at this point, compel Putin to roll back his war. Therefore, phone calls to the Kremlin – which in any case are now few and far between – are probably harmless, if not pointless.', 'Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that began in February 2022 has broken the post–Cold War European security order and completely rewritten the EU-Russia relationship that had formed over the last thirty years. For three decades, the foundations of those relations were economic and energy interdependence. Now, as Russia poses the biggest threat to peace and stability in Europe, all areas of relations have been securitized. Through eight comprehensive sanctions packages adopted by the EU, the union’s member states are systematically cutting all economic ties. Europe’s decoupling from Russian oil and gas ends fifty years of connectivity and mutually beneficial energy relations. This will put Russia’s economic model under pressure and push the country further toward China and Asia more generally.', '- Just as the war has revealed gaps in Russian military capabilities, it has also shown that the multilateral institutions at the heart of the alliance – NATO and the European Union – were not built for crisis response. This means that in the medium term (three to seven years), Europe will need to:', 'The future of Europe is contingent on whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is able to achieve all, some, or none of his aims in Ukraine.

"Do other animals actually have “human” facial expressions (Smiles, Frowns, Furrowed brows) or is it just our minds WANTING to see facial expressions in animals?","While it may seem like other animals have ""human"" facial expressions, such as smiles, frowns, and furrowed brows, this is likely just our minds wanting to see those expressions in animals. Research has shown that horses are able to distinguish between positive and negative facial expressions from humans, however this ability may be due to them applying an ancestral ability to read the facial expressions of their own species onto humans[3]. Additionally, research has found that the facial expressions of humans are not similar to those of chimpanzees, dogs, patas monkeys, or baboons[3][4]. While some scholars have suggested that certain facial expressions, such as the ""scream face"" and the ""disgust/rain face"" may be similar across humans and other animals[5], this has not been empirically proven.","['A University of Sussex research team, led by Amy Smith alongside the veteran animal-behavior scientist Karen McComb, showed a group of 28 horses large photographs of man’s face making either a positive (smiling) or negative (angry, brows furrowed) emotional expression. The results showed that horses were able to automatically distinguish between the two expressions, and what they meant.', 'The human neocortex is not as adept at processing facial expressions as our animal brain. In fact, when our animal brain creates a real expression, it originates from the primal area of the brain which still exists in us today. The neocortex is responsible for those false expressions that we may use to deceive others or ourselves.', 'The authors speculated that horses may simply have been applying an ancestral ability to read the facial expressions of their own species “onto a morphologically different species,” in this case, humans. These same University of Sussex scientists found last year that horses have 17 distinct facial expressions—more than dogs’ 16, or chimpanzees’ 14—many of which are similar to humans’ 27 facial movements, like creased brows or eyes widened in fear. (So far, this method of coding facial expressions hasn’t been applied to wild animals, and those that aren’t part of humans’ evolutionary lineage.)', ""The prototypical facial expression of fear in humans comprises raised eyebrows and wide eyes and mouth (AU1, AU2, AU4, AU5, AU20 and AU25; Ekman et al., Reference Ekman, Friesen and Hager2002), which reflects Darwin's (Reference Darwin1872) description of such an expression whereby ‘the eyes and mouth are widely opened, and the eyebrows raised’ (p. 289). Again, while Darwin (Reference Darwin1872) did not draw any clear comparisons with this configuration in other animals, Bolwig (Reference Bolwig1964) suggested that faces of frightened humans are similar to those of frightened monkeys (patas monkeys and baboons), chimpanzees and dogs. While there is no FACS yet developed for patas monkeys or baboons, we can assume that the comparison with chimpanzees and dogs is unfounded as there is no AU4, AU5 or AU20 present in the FACs for either species, or additionally AU1 or AU2 in dogs."", 'While Darwin (Reference Darwin1872) made the above three direct comparisons between human and non-human animal facial expression, a number of scholars have made other credible comparisons, such as the ‘scream face’ and the ‘disgust/rain face’.']"
How can cows put on massive amounts of muscle and weight from a grass diet. But not me on a grass/plant diet?,"Cows have the ability to convert grass into foods of high nutritional value such as meat and milk, thanks to one of their stomachs, rumen, which is responsible for the fermentation process that converts pasture into milk precursors[3]. Additionally, cows can eat between 25,000 and 30,000 morsels of grass in a day, and the differences in these amounts depend on how accessible the grass is to them[4]. Unlike cows, humans cannot digest plant cells, so they get fewer nutrients from the grass/plant diet and need to obtain protein from other sources. Furthermore, grass is not only difficult to digest, but time-consuming to eat, and humans would need to spend most of their day munching away on grass to get enough protein and other nutrients in their diet[5].","['When you think of protein rich foods, you probably envision meat, eggs, beans and the like. However, animals that eat almost exclusively grass, such as cows and horses, have no problem getting enough protein in their diet. Unlike humans, herbivores are capable of digesting plant cells and getting to the nutrients locked inside, like protein.', 'The grass and hay horses consume gives them all the protein, carbs, minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants they need to grow big muscles without any meat or animal products. If you want to put muscle weight back on your horse, you may need to add grain and supplements and make sure he gets plenty of exercise too.', 'Unlike humans, cows have the ability to convert grass into foods of high nutritional value such as meat and milk. This is because one of their stomachs, rumen, is responsible for the fermentation process that converts pasture into milk precursors. However, other by-products such as methane (CH4) gas is also generated, emitted into the atmosphere primarily through the cows’ belching, and contributes to climate change.', 'In one day, a cow can eat between 25,000 and 30,000 morsels of grass. What do the differences in these amounts depend on? They will depend on how accessible the grass is to them. For instance, the height of the grass could make a difference. Accordingly, a doctoral thesis conducted by Alejandra Marín, from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia and with support of the CIAT Tropical Forages team, looks at whether there is an optimal height of grass that would allow cows to consume better quality grass in less time while producing less CH4.', 'Grass is not only difficult to digest, but time-consuming to eat. Many herbivores depend on grass for a majority of their diet, but grass doesn’t contain as much protein as meat does. A predator can get enough protein by eating perhaps only a handful of meaty meals a day. However, animals who eat grass must spend most of their day munching away on grass to get enough protein and other nutrients in their diet.']"
"In theory, could we take a person and keep replacing their old/failing organs and effectively make them immortal? Why not?","In theory, it is possible to take a person and keep replacing their old/failing organs in order to make them immortal, however, it is not known if it will be possible for humans in the near-future[1]. There are also a number of ethical considerations that must be taken into account, such as the potential for a change in the world's social structures[2][3], the implications of a deceitful God[3], the ethical implications of genetic manipulation and nanotechnology[5], and the potential undesirability of immortality[4][5].","['Life extension technologies promise a path to complete rejuvenation. Cryonics holds out the hope that the dead can be revived in the future, following sufficient medical advancements. While, as shown with creatures such as hydra and Planarian worms, it is indeed possible for a creature to be biologically immortal, it is not known if it will be possible for humans in the near-future.', ""If human beings were to achieve immortality, there would most likely be a change in the world's social structures. Sociologists argue that human beings' awareness of their own mortality shapes their behavior. With the advancements in medical technology in extending human life, there may need to be serious considerations made about future social structures. The world is already experiencing a global demographic shift of increasingly ageing populations with lower replacement rates. The social changes that are made to accommodate this new population shift may be able to offer insight on the possibility of an immortal society."", 'Peter Van Inwagen has offered a somewhat extravagant solution to these problems: “Perhaps at the moment of each man’s death, God removes his corpse and replaces it with a simulacrum which is what is burned or rots. Or perhaps God is not quite so wholesale as this: perhaps He removes for ‘safekeeping’ only the ‘core person’ – the brain and central nervous system – or even some special part of it” (Van Inwagen, 1997: 246). This would seem to solve the problem of spatio-temporal continuity. The body would never cease to exist, it would only be stored somewhere else until the moment of resurrection, and therefore, it would conserve spatio-temporal continuity. However, such an alternative seems to presuppose a deceitful God (He would make us believe the corpse that rots is the original one, when in fact, it is not), and would thus contradict the divine attribute of benevolence (a good God would not lie), a major tenet of monotheistic religions that defend the doctrine of resurrection.', 'Some scientists, futurists, and philosophers have theorized about the immortality of the human body, with some suggesting that human immortality may be achievable in the first few decades of the 21st century with the help of certain technologies such as mind uploading (digital immortality). Other advocates believe that life extension is a more achievable goal in the short term, with immortality awaiting further research breakthroughs. The absence of aging would provide humans with biological immortality, but not invulnerability to death by disease or injury. Whether the process of internal immortality is delivered within the upcoming years depends chiefly on research (and in neuron research in the case of internal immortality through an immortalized cell line) in the former view and perhaps is an awaited goal in the latter case.', 'Most scientists are skeptical of the prospect of resuscitating already dead people, but some are more enthusiastic about the prospect of indefinitely procrastinating death by stopping the aging processes. Scientist Aubrey De Grey has proposed some strategies for engineered negligible senescence: their goal is to identify the mechanisms accountable for aging, and attempt to stop, or even, reverse them (by, say cell repair) (De Grey and Rae, 2008). Some of these strategies involve genetic manipulation and nanotechnology, and hence they bring forth ethical issues. These strategies also bring concern about the ethics of immortality, that is, is immortality even desirable? (See section 3 of this article).']"

The quality of fresh beef makes it a more flavorful and satisfying burger that consumers will appreciate. In addition, using fresh beef rather than frozen meat is a more environmentally friendly option because frozen meat consumes a lot of energy to maintain its frozen state. McDonald’s switching to fresh beef is a good step, but some ingredients used in its food may not be suitable for the environment. The chain’s patties, for example, contain fillers and preservatives, which can have a negative impact on the environment. Even if these ingredients are not ideal, they are better than nothing. McDonald’s made the right decision in replacing the frozen beef with fresh beef. Despite this, the chain still has a lot of work to do in terms of sustainable development.', 'McDonald’s began testing fresh (rather than frozen) beef in a handful of stores earlier this year, and considering the subpar quality of its burgers, that certainly sounds like a good thing. Or does it? A recent survey of McDonald’s franchisees suggests store owners are concerned that the introduction of fresh burger patties could end up spelling disaster for the brand.']"
How did people get horses to charge into lines of spears when horses are spooked so easily?,"Horses were trained to pull chariots, to be ridden as light or heavy cavalry, or to carry armoured knights, and were taught to accept sudden or unusual movements of humans while using a weapon or avoiding one[1]. During charges, the speed was kept to 20 km/h to prevent a break in formation and fatigued horses[2]. Horses were also trained to kick, strike, and even bite, thus becoming weapons themselves for the warriors they carried[1]. The saddle and stirrup were major innovations that revolutionised the effectiveness of mounted warriors in battle, allowing the rider to distribute their weight and protect the horse's back[4]. Finally, it was common for knights to dismount to fight, while their horses were sent to the rear and kept ready for pursuit[5].","[""Whether horses were trained to pull chariots, to be ridden as light or heavy cavalry, or to carry the armoured knight, much training was required to overcome the horse's natural instinct to flee from noise, the smell of blood, and the confusion of combat. They also learned to accept any sudden or unusual movements of humans while using a weapon or avoiding one. Horses used in close combat may have been taught, or at least permitted, to kick, strike, and even bite, thus becoming weapons themselves for the warriors they carried."", 'Mounted charges were carefully managed. A charge\'s maximum speed was 20 km/h; moving faster resulted in a break in formation and fatigued horses. Charges occurred across clear rising ground, and were effective against infantry both on the march and when deployed in a line or column. A foot battalion formed in line was vulnerable to cavalry, and could be broken or destroyed by a well-formed charge. Traditional cavalry functions altered by the end of the 19th century. Many cavalry units transferred in title and role to ""mounted rifles"": troops trained to fight on foot, but retaining mounts for rapid deployment, as well as for patrols, scouting, communications, and defensive screening. These troops differed from mounted infantry, who used horses for transport but did not perform the old cavalry roles of reconnaissance and support.', 'They could get in amongst men, they would trample men and they made the most excellent platform. From the horse, you could stab down to the left, stab down to the right, you could cut, you could scythe, hacking all about you.', ""Two major innovations that revolutionised the effectiveness of mounted warriors in battle were the saddle and the stirrup. Riders quickly learned to pad their horse's backs to protect themselves from the horse's spine and withers, and fought on horseback for centuries with little more than a blanket or pad on the horse's back and a rudimentary bridle. To help distribute the rider's weight and protect the horse's back, some cultures created stuffed padding that resembles the panels of today's English saddle. Both the Scythians and Assyrians used pads with added felt attached with a surcingle or girth around the horse's barrel for increased security and comfort. Xenophon mentioned the use of a padded cloth on cavalry mounts as early as the 4th century BC."", 'The heavy cavalry charge, while it could be effective, was not a common occurrence. Battles were rarely fought on land suitable for heavy cavalry. While mounted riders remained effective for initial attacks, by the end of the 14th century, it was common for knights to dismount to fight, while their horses were sent to the rear, kept ready for pursuit. Pitched battles were avoided if possible, with most offensive warfare in the early Middle Ages taking the form of sieges, and in the later Middle Ages as mounted raids called chevauchées, with lightly armed warriors on swift horses.[note 3]']"
Why is it socially/morally unacceptable to eat a certain animals?,"Eating certain animals is socially and morally unacceptable because it is viewed as an unnecessary taking of life, especially when done for convenience or out of habit[3]. Ethicists and non-ethicists alike have argued that killing an animal, like killing a human, can only be justified in extreme circumstances[3]. Some have argued that animals have a distinctly different moral standing from humans, and that it is not wrong to eat meat if it is not essential to nutrition[3][5]. Additionally, people may feel that it is morally wrong to eat animals in comparison to the hypothetical situation of an alien species more advanced than humans landing on Earth and locking humans in cages to be served as dishes in their restaurants[1].","['Some ask us to confront the circumstance of an alien species more advanced than humans landing on Earth. If we’re justified in eating less intelligent animals because they have less cognitive capacity than we do, would we also argue that it’s perfectly moral and okay for the smarter-than-us aliens to lock humans in cages and then usher them to the slaughterhouse to serve us as dishes at their restaurants?', 'On the “yes it is ethical” side of the debate, people have a pretty simple argument: Animals eating animals is a fact of life and always has been—it’s the food chain at work—and humans eating other animals is no less ethical than a lion or a shark or a venus fly trap doing so. When Benjamin Franklin opened up a fish and saw a smaller fish inside of it, he reasoned, “If you eat one another, I don’t see why we mayn’t eat you.”[footnote2]Source.[/footnote2]', ""Ethical vegetarians say that the reasons for not hurting or killing animals are similar to the reasons for not hurting or killing humans. They argue that killing an animal, like killing a human, can only be justified in extreme circumstances, such as when one's life is threatened. Consuming a living creature just for its taste, for convenience, or out of habit is not justifiable. Some ethicists have added that humans, unlike other animals, are morally conscious of their behavior and have a choice; this is why there are laws governing human behavior, and why it is subject to moral standards. Ethical vegetarian concerns have become more widespread in developed countries, particularly because of the spread of factory farming, more open and graphic documentation of what human meat-eating entails for the animal, and environmental consciousness. Reducing the worldwide massive food waste would also contribute to reduce meat waste and therefore save animals."", 'In a 2014 survey of 406 US philosophy professors, approximately 60% of ethicists and 45% of non-ethicist philosophers said it was at least somewhat ""morally bad"" to eat meat from mammals. A 2020 survey of 1812 published English-language philosophers found that 48% said it was permissible to eat animals in ordinary circumstances, while 45% said it was not.

Adjunct professor Timothy Hsiao argues that “sentience is not sufﬁcient for moral status.” He puts eating an animal in the same bucket as cutting a flower from his garden, explaining that “although animals experience pain as it is physically bad, their experience of it is not in itself morally bad. They are harmed in feeling pain, but this harm is not of a moral kind … Since animals lack moral status, it is not wrong to eat meat, even if this is not essential to nutrition.”']"
Have plants evolved to become more human dependent?,"Yes, plants have evolved to become more human dependent over the years. Humans have been interacting with plants since before the dawn of our species, and plants have been evolving in response to human selective pressures since long before people began consciously altering them through breeding[1]. Plants have also evolved certain traits to better use humans as seed dispersers[2]. Additionally, plants produce chemicals that alter human brain chemistry, physiology, and behavior[3], and this tight co-evolution and reliance of humans on plants has led to the question of who actually domesticated whom[3]. Furthermore, a new view of higher plants as intelligent organisms that actively manipulate their environment to serve their needs has been proposed[5], and plants are a crucial factor for addressing our environmental and social challenges[5].","['The plants we consume for food have changed drastically in the 10,000 years since humans began practicing agriculture, but hominids have been intensively interacting with the plants and animals around them since before the dawn of our species. As humans became aware of the ability to modify crops through selective breeding, the evolution of new traits in plants greatly increased. However, plants have been evolving in response to human selective pressures since long before people began consciously altering them through breeding.', ""During the Early and Mid-Holocene, plants in specific locations around the world started to evolve new traits in response to human cultivation practices. As human populations increased in size and became more concentrated, the selective pressures that people placed on these plants increased. In the wild, plants often evolve mutualistic relationships in response to heavy herbivory pressures. The same evolutionary responses, Spengler argues, can be seen in farmers' fields during the early steps towards domestication, with plants developing traits to better use humans as seed dispersers."", ""Albert Seward in his book Plants: What They Are, What They Do was among the first to speculate that plants might in fact be superior to many animal species. Ian T. Baldwin suggested that higher plants overcome their immobility constraints by their plant‐specific environmental intelligence (see Further Reading). Humans are not excluded from plants’ manipulative behaviour either. From the plant's perspective, domestication is not just subservience but rather co‐evolution whereby both partners benefit from each other 6, 7. Crops and many medicinal plants produce chemicals that alter human brain chemistry, physiology and behaviour 6, similar to flowering plants that manipulate insects to become their pollinators and bodyguards. Our tight co‐evolution and the reliance of humans on plants to provide food, medicines and recreational drugs might raise the question of who actually domesticated whom 7, 8."", 'In a new study published in Trends in Plant Science, Dr. Robert Spengler examines these evolutionary responses and theorizes that all of the earliest traits to evolve in the wild relatives of modern domesticated crops are linked to human seed dispersal and the evolutionary need for a plant to spread its offspring.', 'A new view of higher plants as cognitive and intelligent organisms that actively manipulate their environment to serve their needs 7, 8, 9, 10 could therefore dramatically change our understanding of life on Earth and help us to better cope with climate changes. Better understanding of plant intelligence is relevant not only for maintaining life‐supporting ecosystems and climate patterns, but also for understanding their co‐evolution with insects and animals, as well as with humans since our modern, sophisticated civilization is utterly dependent on crop plants 7. As history shows, failing crop production and resulting famines can easily spark social unrest, wars or even a total collapse of societies. Plants are therefore a crucial factor for addressing our environmental and social challenges 1, 7, 8, 9, 10.']"
Are bees in danger? What does that mean to us? What are actions that an everyday person could do to help?,"Yes, bees are in danger. This means that their role in the environment and their contribution to our food supply is in jeopardy. Without bees, many of the food sources we rely on would not be able to reproduce and would become rare and inaccessible to most people[4]. To help save the bees, everyday people can take multiple actions such as reversing the major threats to bees, like pesticide use and habitat destruction[2]. They can also pay attention to the message that bee’s endangerment sends, and shift their perspectives of their environment and food chains to include the other organisms that support plants’ lives[5]. Finally, they can also recognize the importance of bees on World Bee Day (20 May) and raise awareness of their contribution to the environment[5].","['For example, researchers have suggested that studying the actions of bees could help experts develop emergency plans to evacuate people from an overcrowded environment.', 'That brings us to how we can save the bees. Just like there are multiple threats endangering bee populations, so too there are numerous actions one can take to help. We can start by reversing the major threats to bees we’ve already covered.', 'Bees are a fantastic symbol of nature. That they are in trouble is a sign that our natural environment is not in the good shape it should be.', 'The ecological issue of the possible extinction of the bees is also a humanitarian issue, as the stability of human populations largely depends on the stability of bee populations. Considering the crucial role of bees’ pollination activities in supporting our agricultural systems, their disappearance would likely result in a food crisis for humanity. Supplies of foods such as apples, berries, avocados, coffee and onions would fall drastically since they require the help of pollinators to reproduce. With plummeting supplies, the prices of these foods would skyrocket, making them rare and inaccessible to most people.', 'On World Bee Day (20 May), we recognise the importance of these beautiful and small creatures, whose activities help preserve and perpetuate life on Earth. The decimation of their populations should remind us of the destabilising nature of human activity, which is possible to prevent and correct. Our perspectives of our environments and our food chains must shift from focusing solely on the plants we eat to including the other organisms that support plants’ lives - and by extension, our lives as well.']"
"During the Cold War, nations changed their inventory of ordnance regularly, now they use weapons/vehicles/aircraft decades old. Why?","Nations use weapons/vehicles/aircraft decades old during the Cold War due to availability and cost. Older equipment is often cheaper and more readily available than newer equipment. For example, the M113 has been produced in large quantities and is being replaced in some U.S. units by the armored multipurpose vehicle, making it available for transfer[2]. The United States could also temporarily equip some artillery batteries with fewer howitzers than usual in the case of a major conflict[3]. Additionally, the United States has had to conserve its inventory of Javelin missiles[4]. Furthermore, the United States has destroyed much of its chemical weapons stockpile[5], making it difficult to obtain newer weapons systems.","['Even if declines in available inventories restrict transfers and new production cannot keep up with demand, the United States and allies could provide older equipment or equipment from third parties. Although these weapons can be effective, such an approach would be a change from the practice up to now of providing top-of-the-line equipment equivalent to what first-line U.S. and NATO forces use. That would likely engender concerns from those who advocate maximum support for Ukraine.', 'These tracked vehicles are used as “battlefield taxis,” which give some protection to troops as they maneuver. However, they do not have the heavy armor of a tank or the weapons of a fighting vehicle. The United States produced about 80,000 in many configurations and variants since the original version entered the force in the early 1960s. Dozens of foreign countries use either the U.S. or domestically produced versions. The M113 is being replaced in some U.S. units by the armored multipurpose vehicle. Because the number of M113s produced is so large, and many are being replaced, the United States could provide many more to Ukraine. The constraint will the time required to repair these older vehicles and get them fully functional prior to transfer, as well as training maintainers and operators.', 'For weapons, inventory concerns arise because the United States needs to have enough systems to equip operational units and an amount for maintenance pipelines and training organizations. In theory, the United States could take some systems from late-deploying units. For example, the U.S. Army could temporarily equip some artillery batteries with four howitzers instead of the customary six or eight. In the unlikely event of a major conflict, these units could get additional systems from overhead or new production. Because the units are late deploying, there would be enough time to redistribute assets.', 'Reportedly, the United States has given about one-third of its inventory to Ukraine, and reports have emerged that the military has raised concerns about having enough for other conflicts. Surprisingly, the August 19 arms package includes another 1,000 Javelins despite the low inventory. The current production rate is about 1,000 a year. Although DOD is working to increase that, it will be many years before the inventory is fully replenished.', 'By the late 1980s, in response to pressure from the Soviet Union and various NATO allies, the United States began the wholesale destruction of much of its chemical weapons stockpile (at places such as the army arsenal at Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and the Johnson Atoll in the South Pacific) in an effort to disarm, as well as destroy older weapons that had become unstable. Research continued in the United States on various chemical weapons systems through the 1990s and on into the new millennium. At present, the United States maintains a large and sophisticated arsenal of chemical and nerve agents for tactical and strategic use.72']"
I get the feeling that meats from fish  &  birds are generally more healthy than meats from mammals like pigs or cows. Is that even true and why?,"Eating fish and birds is generally more healthy than meats from mammals like pigs or cows because fish contains essential omega-3 fatty acids and unsaturated fats which are beneficial for those with iron deficiencies or pregnant moms to be[2]. However, replacing pigs and cows with birds and fish leads to the slaughter of more animals because birds and fish are smaller[3]. Additionally, while meat usually refers to muscle tissue and associated fat, many people around the world make use of the whole animal, including all sorts of other edible tissues such as organs[4]. Meat typically comes from cows, pigs, and chickens[4][5].","['It’s clear that what separates fish from meats—meats as we know of as beef, poultry, pork, and game makes it the healthier of the two choices, and the most convenient. Adding the right portions of fish to your diet can benefit your physical and mental well-being greatly.', 'Generally, we consume land-meats far more than we do fish. The main difference between meat and fish is that consuming more fish has a long list of health benefits that tend to outweigh consuming just beef, poultry, pork or game in general. For those with iron deficiencies or pregnant moms to be, still eating red meat is important but balancing that with at least 2-3 servings of fish every week ensure you are getting the right amount of essential omega-3 fatty acids and unsaturated fats.', 'Replacing pigs and cows with birds and fish, though, usually leads to the slaughter of many more animals, because, with a few exceptions, birds and fish are smaller. If you were to eat a pound of beef a day — say a huge steak or four beef patties — you might take a year to consume a single animal. If you were instead to eat a daily pound of chicken or salmon, you might eat hundreds of animals per year.', 'The meat you eat on a regular basis probably comes from just a few animals, such as cows, pigs, and chickens.

Why do bugs that breed and nest in certain types of trees colonize houses made of a different material?,"Bugs that breed and nest in certain types of trees may colonize houses made of a different material because the wrong material used can be detrimental to the insects. For example, wild bees can injure their wings in the nesting box on wood that is too rough or the wrong material[3], and transparent plastic or glass tubes can become a death trap[3]. Also, among the wood-destroying insects, some attack healthy, living trees, but many more attack trees that are weakened by disease, fire, or old age, or are blown down or felled for lumber[4]. Furthermore, Dominik (1966) found that some species of beetles attacking building timbers attack wood heavily infected with fungi, some attack sound, uninfected wood, and others attack either infected or uninfected wood[5]. This means that the insects may be attracted to the house because of the materials used, even if they are not the same type of material they would normally use in their natural environment.","['You have set up an bug hotel and after some time you realise that there are still no inhabitants? Unfortunately, this happens again and again because various sources of error can make the nesting aid unattractive to insects. Now it is important to identify which factor interferes with the colonization of their insect house. The most common mistakes in the construction and installation of an insect hotel are as follows:', '1. Wrong material used: Plastic, glass tubes, pine cones or fresh wood are poorly accepted or not accepted at all by most insect species. Softwoods are also not ideal for many wild bee species. Therefore, better suited for the construction of an bug hotel hardwoods such as oak, elm, oak, beech, hazelnut, chestnut or fruit woods.', 'In particular, the choice of the wrong materials can do more harm than good to the insects. For example, wild bees can injure their wings in the nesting box on wood that is too rough or the wrong material. Even transparent plastic or glass tubes can become a death trap. Although these are often offered with insect hotels, as they allow very good observations, the bee brood often fungi due to the high humidity inside. Therefore, always make sure to set up an bug hotel that is as species-appropriate as possible.', 'Among the wood-destroying insects there are a few species that attack healthy, living trees, but many more attack trees that are weakened by disease, fire, or old age, or are blown down or felled for lumber. Included among these insects are the bark beetles and ambrosia beetles (Scolytidae and Platypodidae), some weevils and snout beetles (Curculionidae), the flatheaded borers (Buprestidae), most roundheaded borers (Cerambycidae), some caterpillars (Cossidae), and the woodwasps (horntails) of the family Siricidae. The larvae of some of these pests require many years to develop, and the adults may emerge from seasoned wood in buildings or furniture long after construction. However, none of the above insects, except the cerambycid Hylotrupes bajulus (L.) (the oldhouse borer), reinfests seasoned lumber from which the adults have emerged.', 'Dominik (1966) found that, among the species of beetles attacking building timbers, some attacked wood heavily infected with fungi, some attacked sound, uninfected wood, and others attacked either infected or uninfected wood. He observed that a single genus (Anobium) contained species that required and species that shunned fungus-infected wood. Anobium punctatum (De Geer) occurs outdoors in Great Britain where wood has resisted fungal attack, possibly because of sheltered location or good drainage. Old branch scars on trunks of trees or areas of exposed sapwood are almost always infested, and the freedom from fungal decay in such situations led Hickin (1963a) to suspect that some fungicidal material had been secreted into the wood by the developing larvae.']"
"If we extract oil from underground ""reservoirs"", why don't we dump toxic waste in them after they've been emptied?","It is dangerous to dump toxic waste into underground reservoirs that have been emptied of oil because of the risk of contamination to the environment and drinking water. Many of the wastewater from extraction is still too salty to be dumped into rivers, and is instead recycled for use at other wells or held in ponds or tanks. Furthermore, the process of extraction involves drilling and pushing the canister filled with steel into the rock[4], which can cause unintentional releases and transmission of wastewater and hydraulic fracturing solutions to streams[5]. As a result, it is not safe to dump toxic waste into previously emptied underground reservoirs.","[""For a while, the wastewater was dumped directly into rivers, untreated. Some drillers shipped it to municipal water treatment plants, which weren't equipped to handle the toxic material in the waste. A current practice is to pump it temporarily into man-made, lined holding ponds. But some of those ponds have leaked. Trucks leaked wastewater as well. And there are the claims, most noticeably made in the HBO documentary Gasland, that backyard drinking water wells were being polluted by drilling."", 'Much of the Earth’s crude oil is trapped in underground reservoirs, but some leaks to the surface, and has been doing so for millions of years. It is estimated that about half of the oil entering the world’s oceans today comes from these natural seeps and the rest from human activities. Oil enters waterways not only when an offshore rig blows up, a pipeline ruptures, or a tanker runs aground, but also when it is rinsed off roads and parking lots, spilled at marinas and discharged by outboard motors, released during offshore oil operations, or washed out of ships’ ballast tanks.', ""Then drillers take the water — still too salty to go into rivers — and use it again to fracture shale at another well. What isn't recycled goes to waste wells in Ohio or into holding ponds or steel tanks in Pennsylvania. The solid material left over is shipped to landfills, as regulated by state law."", 'At 11.30am, the crew of oil workers used a wire cable to lower an 80cm-long, 20cm-wide, 64kg canister — filled with steel rather than radioactive waste — down a previously drilled borehole. Then, using a tool called a “tractor” invented by the industry to reach horizontally into mile-deep oil reservoirs, they pushed it 120 metres farther away from the borehole through the rock.', 'Fears of contamination stemming from intentional discharges were compounded by uncontrolled releases of fracking fluids, drilling fluids, and wastewater into the environment. Leaks from flow lines, storage pits, and storage tanks were the most common causes of uncontrolled releases at drill sites. Trucking accidents and illegal dumping led to offsite releases of fracking fluids and wastewater. Nearly 1,300 spills, releasing more than one quarter of a million gallons of various fluids, were reported to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection between 2005 and 2014. Evidence from forensic analyses, though not definitive, suggests that contaminants from some of these spills leached into groundwaters tapped for residential drinking water supply. Moreover, a small fraction of unintentional releases resulted in the transmission of wastewater and hydraulic fracturing solutions to streams.']"
"How come animals can sense, or pre-tell of natural disasters, but humans can't?","Animals may be able to detect natural disasters before humans because they can detect sound and vibrations at low frequencies that humans cannot[1]. This may be because they can hear and feel things that humans cannot[2], and they may also be able to pick up infrasonic sound pulses created by storms and earthquakes[3]. It is also possible that animals have learned to associate these low frequency sounds with danger, and have developed a fight-or-flight response when they sense them. Despite decades of research, scientists have not yet been able to figure out how to predict earthquakes and tsunamis[1], and the U.S. Geological Survey has stated that changes in animal behavior cannot be used to predict earthquakes[2].","['“Animals have the ability to detect sounds and vibrations at low frequencies that human being can not detect , allowing them to sense impending earthquakes.

Despite decades of research , scientists do not know how to predict earthquakes and tsunamis, but animals can do better. From many natural disasters ,many stories emerge of predictive pets who have known beforehand and alerted humans of impending disaster. Many animals show signs of restlessness before a natural disaster such as tsunami, hurricane, volcanic eruption or earthquake. There are numerous anecdotes about how dogs often start behaving abnormally right before an earthquake, how elephants seem to lose their mind before a landslide, or how sharks movement patterns change before a hurricane or a cyclone .', 'So what does science have to say about the possibility of animals having psychic powers or their ability to predict disasters? Many scientists are skeptical and dismiss these as anecdotal accounts, attributing it to a “psychological focusing effect” that people report after the disaster occurred.

But nonetheless, many scientists do agree that animals can hear and feel things that humans can’t.', 'Still, researchers like Liz Von Muggenthaler — who appears in NATURE’s Can Animals Predict Disaster? — believe animals can pick up the “infrasonic” sound pulses created by storms and earthquakes, and get a head start on fleeing to safety.

Why is it socially acceptable to boil lobsters alive?,"Boiling lobsters alive is socially acceptable because it is currently legal in many countries and reduces the risk of food poisoning from bacteria in their flesh, as well as making them tastier and better presented on the plate[2].

Why are white rats mainly used for studies instead of other rodent species?,"White rats are mainly used for studies instead of other rodent species because they have a genetic makeup and physiology similar to humans, which has allowed scientists to explore a variety of physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms that would not be possible in a mouse model[3]. Additionally, rats are more widely used in studying cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, as well as the onset of conditions that relate to the brain, digestive system and various health problems related to behavior[1]. They are also larger in size than mice, making handling, sampling and performing procedures easier[5]. The historical importance of this species to scientific research is also reflected by the amount of literature on it[4].","['In terms of the diseases that they are used to study, rats are usually not the model of choice when it comes to disorders related to neoplasms, blood and immune function. However, they’re more widely used in studying cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, as well as the onset of conditions that relate to the brain, digestive system, and various health problems related to behavior. Researchers are often advised to begin their studies using rat models in these areas, not only because they are a suitable model, but also due to the fact that rats have already helped scientists reach a few significant breakthroughs in these areas. Some of the disadvantages of choosing a different animal model for these fields could be difficulty in collecting accurate data, comparing data from previous studies that used rat models, and drawing definitive conclusions that could apply to future studies.', 'Rats were the first mammalian species specifically domesticated to be used in the laboratory. Two centuries ago, the brown rat Rattus norvegicus was used by scientists to understand human physiology and medicine, concentrating on the effects of food and oxygen deprivation. Rats have since been used to answer a wide range of basic science questions related to common human diseases in the fields of physiology, immunology, pharmacology, toxicology, nutrition, behavior and learning.', 'Research scientists worldwide agree that the use of rat models for disease research and experimentation has become more relevant in the past few years. While species such as saccharomyces cerevisiae, fruit flies, and zebrafish have been used for the study of cancer, organ development, recombination or large scale mutations, the rat model offers insights into human disease that the study of other species will not allow. When animals such as mice or rats are selected as models for genetic experimentation, the main reason is the similarity of their genetic makeup to human DNA. In the case of rats specifically, their particular DNA and physiology has allowed scientists to explore a variety of physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms that would not be possible in a mouse model.', 'The historical importance of this species to scientific research is reflected by the amount of literature on it: roughly 50% more than that on laboratory mice. Laboratory rats are frequently subject to dissection or microdialysis to study internal effects on organs and the brain, such as for cancer or pharmacological research. Laboratory rats not sacrificed may be euthanized or, in some cases, become pets.', 'Researchers will choose rats over mice when it comes to their use in research for a number of reasons. They are larger in size which makes handling, sampling and performing procedures easier.']"
Why did humans evolve to eat cooked meat?,"Humans evolved to eat cooked meat because cooking increased food efficiency, which enabled our prehuman ancestors to spend less time foraging, chewing, and digesting[2]. Cooking also had other effects on how the human body evolved, such as making food softer and easier to digest, and increasing the energy they can get from the food they eat[5].","['Eating meat and cooking food made us human, the studies suggest, enabling the brains of our prehuman ancestors to grow dramatically over a period of a few million years.', 'Humans (species in the genus Homo) are the only animals that cook their food, and Wrangham argues Homo erectus emerged about two million years ago as a result of this unique trait. Cooking had profound evolutionary effect because it increased food efficiency, which allowed human ancestors to spend less time foraging, chewing, and digesting. H. erectus developed a smaller, more efficient digestive tract, which freed up energy to enable larger brain growth. Wrangham also argues that cooking and control of fire generally affected species development by providing warmth and helping to fend off predators, which helped human ancestors adapt to a ground-based lifestyle. Wrangham points out that humans are highly evolved for eating cooked food and cannot maintain reproductive fitness with raw food.', ""Anthropologists have long debated about the importance of meat-eating and cooking in human evolution. One prominent Harvard primatologist, Dr. Richard Wrangham, proposed in 1999 the idea that cooking is the most important adaptation that allowed humans to evolve into who we are today – but what if we didn't need to cook meat to make it more easily digestible? What if simply letting it break down naturally, as it starts to do almost immediately after an animal dies, made it similarly digestible?"", 'Both sets of researchers said their conclusion — that cooked food and meat were necessary for human brain development — is not a statement of how the human diet must have been, but rather how it likely was in order to make humans ""human.""', 'All known human societies eat cooked foods, and biologists generally agree cooking could have had major effects on how the human body evolved. For example, cooked foods tend to be softer than raw ones, so humans can eat them with smaller teeth and weaker jaws. Cooking also increases the energy they can get from the food they eat. Starchy potatoes and other tubers, eaten by people across the world, are barely digestible when raw. Moreover, when humans try to eat more like chimpanzees and other primates, we cannot extract enough calories to live healthily. Up to 50 percent of women who exclusively eat raw foods develop amenorrhea, or lack of menstruation, a sign the body does not have enough energy to support a pregnancy—a big problem from an evolutionary perspective.']"
"We make leather from cows, sheep and pigs. Why not horses?","Although leather can be made from the skins of horses, it is not as common as leather from cows, sheep, pigs, goats, and other animals[1]. Research has shown that 65% of leather comes from cows, 15% comes from sheep, 11% from pigs and 9% from goats[3], with less than 0.2% of leather coming from any other type of animal. Also, some cows are raised specifically for their skin to meet demand[3][5], making leather from cows more accessible.","['While the large majority of leather comes from cows, it also can come from slaughtered pigs, sheep, kangaroos, goats, deers, horses, countless other animals, even including cats and dogs.', 'Most leather produced and sold in the U.S. is made from the skins of cattle and calves, but leather is also made from sheep, lambs, goats, and pigs.

the sensation of spicy. Do people who like spicy food have fewer or more taste buds that react to spice?,"People who like spicy food do not necessarily have more taste buds that react to spice, but they may have different sensitivity to the chemical capsaicin, which activates a receptor found in your mouth and on your tongue called a TRPV1 receptor[2]. Additionally, there may be a psychological element at play in which spice enjoyers find the burning sensation to be a pleasurable experience, rather than a painful one[2]. Spicy foods are actually detected by a different system than the one for taste, known as the trigeminal nerve, which sends touch, pain, and temperature feelings from your face to your brain[5].","['Connoisseurs know that the sensation of eating spicy foods varies, depending on the strain of heat that\'s being consumed. Sometimes the ""pain"" will be described as a numbing of the body; other times you might feel something in your ears. Dave Dewitt says the reaction to black pepper and horseradish is different than, say, a haban\u200bero because of chemical make-up—specifically due to the presence of isothiocyanates in the first two examples, which can be found in other root crops. ""They react upon your tongue in a different manner. It feels spicy but it\'s not a burning sensation—rather, it affects your nasal and sinus passages, not your tongue,"" says Dewitt. ""That\'s why the burning sensation is on the upper inside part of your mouth.""', ""Spicy foods contain a chemical called capsaicin, which activates a receptor found in your mouth and on your tongue called a TRPV1 receptor. There is some variation in the sensitivity of these receptors, and even the amount of them, from person to person. This variance may be one reason some of us can’t handle the spice, and others love it. Studies have shown that repeated exposure to capsaicin raises the amount needed for a similar effect, so it may also be that the more spicy food you eat, the more you can handle. Lastly, there is likely a psychological element at play in spice-lover's obsession- studies have shown that many spice enjoyers do feel the burn like spice haters, but find it a pleasurable experience, rather than a painful one. Indeed, it seems that to love spicy food is to take pleasure from the pain."", 'What\'s interesting is that folks who eat a lot of spicy food don\'t have numbed or otherwise inured receptors or taste buds than people who can\'t stand the stuff. As Rozin wrote in 1980, ""Chili likers are not insensitive to the irritation that it produces. They come to like the same burning sensation that deters animals and humans that dislike chili."" The difference is a ""hedonic shift,"" meaning that they\'re more used to the burning sensation, with stronger associations between pain and pleasure, than those who don\'t really eat it. This is why people theorize that those who were exposed to spicy foods in their childhood are more likely to like it. (Rozin\'s research also indicates that those with thrill-seeking personalities might be more inclined to go heavy on the hot stuff, which makes sense when you compare the thrill of going on a rollercoaster to that of successfully crushing a bag of Flaming Hot Cheetos.)', ""Spicy isn't a taste , but a physical reaction sensed by nerve endings, not taste buds, on the tongue. Thomas M. Evans on Unsplash"", 'Our bodies detect spice using a completely different system than the one for taste. The trigeminal nerve, which is the part of the nervous system that sends touch, pain, and temperature feelings from your face to your brain, interprets it. In this way, spicy isn’t a taste so much as it is a reaction. Spice actually irritates the tongue and thus sends signals to the brain that the mouth is interacting with something potentially harmful, such as a toxin. The brain then responds by temporarily numbing the tongue, which is the sensation we get when we eat spicy food, as it’s a potential protection mechanism.']"
"If Sheep have to be sheered, and if they escape, they become overgrown to the point they are immobile, how can they survive without humans?","Sheep can survive without humans if they have access to shelter, such as a building, shed, or portable shelter, tree lines, bales, or the lee of a hill[2]. However, without shearing, sheep can develop wool blindness, which impairs their sight, and become so heavy with wool that they have trouble walking or running, eating, and keeping up with the flock for protection, or running from predators[1]. Furthermore, if not shorn, sheep can overheat and die in the summer months and become the target for parasitic species[3]. Lastly, shearing is important to keep the land healthy, as it is part of the ancient relationship between people, grasslands, and grazing animals[5].","['Without shearing, overgrown wool can even develop into “wool blindness” which is a condition that impairs the animal’s sight —and because sheep are prey animals, their sight is necessary for survival. If shearing is neglected, sheep become so heavy with wool that they have trouble walking or running, their ability to graze becomes compromised, and they cannot keep up with the flock for protection, or run from predators. Shearing is also critical to the survival of lambs, particularly in longwool breeds whose lambs need to quickly find their mother’s teats to nurse — sadly, lambs can die of starvation when there is too much wool in the way.', 'Sheep must have access to shelter. Shelter can be provided by any natural or man-made structure that acts as a barrier to wind. This can be provided by a building, shed, or portable shelter. Tree lines, bales, the lee of a hill, etc. can also provide windbreaks.', 'Shearing is crucial to sheep’s health, as a large animal veterinarian will tell you. Dr. Jen Burton, a vet with 10 years of experience specializing in the health and welfare of sustainable livestock, explains “I can’t imagine a veterinarian suggesting that wool be left to grow on a domestic sheep, because that would put the animal at risk for overheating, discomfort and disease. The animal would also be at increased risk for skin disease and parasites. Over time, unshorn wool could eventually impede movement.” Sheep can overheat and die in the summer months if not shorn, and become the target for parasitic species such as ticks, lice, mites, and the maggots that cause fly strike, a gruesome and even deadly condition. Shearing provides both prevention and treatment of any of these infestations.', 'Most of our rescued sheep are wool breeds—or wool/hair crosses—and can’t regulate this excess weight on their own. So we shear them to keep them from overheating and to improve their quality of life. This excess wool isn’t natural—and sheep are the ones who pay the price.', 'Recently some fashion brands have advertised the idea that shearing is unsafe for sheep, in order to market their synthetic fiber products. In California, as in many places, the land we live on depends upon the ancient relationship between people, grasslands, and grazing animals. Many Californians still do not realize they live in a grassland ecosystem or an oak woodland ecosystem, and are only beginning to realize the vulnerability to the cycles of fire with which we coexist.']"
Why is Japan receiving the most hatred for whaling when other countries such as Norway and Iceland is doing it as well ?,"Japan is receiving the most hatred for whaling when compared to other countries such as Norway and Iceland because Japan is using its influence in a heavy-handed way and is trying to use science to justify their whaling activities[2]. Japan also views whaling as a cultural tradition and does not like the idea of foreigners interfering[5]. Furthermore, Japan is ignoring the voices of the Japanese people who are against whaling[4][5].","['In the same way, Japan certainly deserves criticism for its whaling activities and defiant actions. But their critics also need to be fair and at the least, explain clearly why European countries such as Norway and Iceland don’t receive nearly the same level of condemnation.', 'It is disappointing that Japan continues to support whaling and I can see that they seem to be compounding the antagonism against them by trying to use their influence in a heavy-handed way. At the same time, I also find it a little disturbing that virtually all of the criticism against whaling is directed at Japan, with little mention of Norway and Iceland.', 'Specifically, both Norway and Iceland hunt whales as well, in much the same way that Japan does — for commercial, not “scientific” reasons and in defiance of international agreements. Therefore, we have to ask the question, why is Japan singled out for international criticism when few also mention Norway and Iceland’s whaling activities?', 'Fynn is puzzled that Japan is relying heavily on science, but at the same time very emotional when talking about whaling. This can also be observed within the public: most Japanese are not pro-whaling but have an “anti-anti-whaling” attitude according to Fynn for not liking to be criticized by the outside on Japan’s whaling practices. Still nowadays, it remains an emotional topic with all Japanese parties being pro-whaling. Fynn confirms the possible theory that Japan may have given up its financially disastrous scientific missions in return of commercial whaling in their zones in order not having to give in to international pressure on their controversial whaling programs. If there are no subsidies for the sector in the future, according to Fynn whaling will likely disappear in the next 15 years.', ""I also think there is more than a little bit of stubbornness here. Japan sees whaling as a cultural tradition, akin to pottery making, kimonos, and so on. They don't like the idea of foreigners coming in and interfering, which is how they see the IWC and countries like Australia and the US who criticize Japan on whaling. However, they are ignoring that a lot of the opposition about whaling is coming from inside Japan. Why are the voices of the Japanese themselves being ignored by their own government?""]"
Why did most of the mammals from the Ice Age go extinct?,"There are four main theories as to why most of the mammals from the Ice Age went extinct. The first is that a warming climate and expansion of vegetation created unsuitable habitat for the animals[2][5]. The second is that humans caused the extinction, either directly by hunting, or indirectly by burning vegetation needed for survival[4]. The third is that environmental changes combined with hunting caused the extinction of the ice age mammals[2][3]. The fourth is that the last ice age was a major extinction event, and the animals were unable to adapt to whatever changes happened at the end of the Pleistocene Epoch[2][3][5].","['About 10,000-12,000 years ago most of the large mammals from the Ice Ages went extinct. Paleontologists are trying to understand why this happened. There are two possible ideas.', 'A new study has shed new light on why large mammals died out at the end of the ice age, suggesting their extinction was caused by a warming climate and expansion of vegetation that created unsuitable habitat for the animals. The findings, published in the journal PNAS, have major implications for proposals to prevent the soils in the Arctic today from thawing by re-introducing animals such as bison and horses.', 'Although the last ice age was not a major extinction event, roughly 35 different types of large mammals went extinct. Did humans cause the extinction or perhaps a combination of environmental changes and hunting working together rubbed out the ice age mammals? One of the problems is that the evidence paleontologist and scientists collect is rarely complete. Whatever the reason or reasons, large animals were unable to adapt to whatever changes happened at the end of the Pleistocene Epoch. Scientists just cannot seem to put a “bulls-eye” on any single event causing this mini extinction event.', 'As the ice melted at the end of the Pleistocene epoch about 12,000 years ago, large mammals (greater than 10 kilograms) such as the woolly mammoth, the giant sloth, cave dwelling lions, etc. began dying off, eventually disappearing altogether. The cause of the extinctions has, in many cases, been blamed on changing environmental conditions, despite a lack of evidence. In this new effort, the research team has found some evidence to suggest the die-offs were more likely caused by humans—either directly by hunting, or indirectly by burning vegetation needed for survival.', 'Fast forward to 13,000 years ago and what are the theories that explain why the ice age animals went extinct? What was different during the Pleistocene Epoch when giant sloths, giant armadillos, and huge cave bears dominated places like Florida? Most of the animals that perished at the end of the last ice age were called the megafauna or animals over 100 pounds. Huge multi-ton animals like mastodons and mammoths disappeared along with apex predators like saber-toothed tigers and dire wolves. Most of these ice age animals had endured at least 12 previous ice ages and did not go extinct. Why was this one different? Scientists have grappled with this question for over 150 years. Scientists have developed four scientific theories to address this conundrum.']"
How do they get animals to act?,"Animals in films and TV shows are trained to act and behave in a certain way in order to complete a scene. Trainers use positive reinforcement methods such as rewarding the animals with food, a toy, or a hug immediately after a trick is done correctly, or by using a clicker to let the animal know that their treat is coming. Animals need to feel comfortable with their surroundings and with others in order to act[4], and they will take direction from their handlers[5]. Trainers do not use any painful methods such as bullhooks, whips, tight collars, muzzles, electric prods, and other tools of the trade to get animals to act[2].","['For tricky scenes, trainers try to reward the animals immediately after with food, a toy or a hug. But, this isn’t always possible, says Tottman.

Can animals commit suicide ?,"While there is evidence that animals can experience stress, depression, and other mental health issues that can lead to suicide in humans[2], there is not enough data and evidence to conclusively determine whether animals are capable of intentionally putting an end to their own lives.

Animals can feel stressed and can also get depressed. These are factors that can contribute to or leads to suicide in humans. We also know that some behaviors that were once thought to be unique to humans are now being seen in other animals. But is suicide one of those? Do animals really attempt suicide and know they’re doing it?', 'However, there’s still not enough data and evidence to indicate a clear conclusion because committing suicide implies understanding numerous other concepts. For instance, if an animal is capable of committing suicide, it means it’s conscious of its mortality, of the possibility that it can die, of choosing to die, and of having or not having a future. But, above all, this means the animal has will and intention. Some studies focused on these aspects individually, and many found evidence showing that some animal responses were relevant to human emotional behaviors. Nevertheless, there’s still no conclusive evidence showing they are simultaneously aware of all of them.', 'If humans exhibit these behaviors, they’ll definitely be considered suicidal.

Why can other animals eat raw meat from a corpse but humans cannot?,"Humans cannot safely eat raw meat from a corpse because of the risk of parasites, bacteria, and chemical rot, which become more dangerous the longer the flesh has been rotting[5].

First: Can animals eat raw meat without problems? The answer is no — plenty of animals contract diseases or, more commonly, parasites from eating the flesh of other animals. This is one reason that carnivores are eaten so much less commonly than herbivores: not only are they harder to keep and farm, but they are harder to keep healthy via their food source.', 'So, animals can eat raw meat and still be fine because they have become good at separating good meat from the bad type by smelling.', 'The second assumption is that we, humans, cannot eat raw meat. This is also untrue. A blue rare steak is functionally raw everywhere but the edges, and steak tartare is literally nothing but raw, spiced beef. It’s not so much that we can’t eat raw meat — as it is, raw meat is quite risky, and for the exact same reasons as for a lion. The major difference between us and a lion is that a lion tends to chow down immediately after the kill; only humans have taken to storing meat for long periods of time, applying the squirrel’s hoarding strategy to flesh. Most problems with meat, from parasites to simple chemical rot, become more dangerous the longer the flesh has been rotting.']"

Why do governments allow car makers to advertise diesel cars as CO2 friendly (less than 100 g/km) if they pollute far more than similar petrol engines?,"Governments allowed car makers to advertise diesel cars as CO2 friendly (less than 100 g/km) because diesel engines emit less CO2 and greenhouse gases than petrol engines[4]. This is because the fuel used in diesel engines has a higher compression ratio than petrol and it also performs better than petrol engines, allowing to save more CO2[4]. However, they also emit potentially toxic particulate matter that has been shown to significantly impact public health[3], and heating air in an engine produces nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) which include the toxic nitrogen dioxide (NO₂)[5]. Despite the known issues with toxic emissions, governments promoted diesel cars due to their lower CO₂ emissions and climate impacts[1].","['The near EU-wide plan to encourage people to buy diesel vehicles in the past number of years is another example of the lack of connection between air pollution policy and climate change policy, and the difficulties of considering CO₂ emissions separately to the many other thousands of compounds that human activities emit. Replacing petrol cars with diesel ones does result in lower CO₂ emissions and climate impacts but it has clearly been worse for human health.', 'Diesel cars have recently become subject to considerable negative publicity thanks to the amount of toxic emissions they produce. Some governments are planning to discourage their use or even ban them from urban areas altogether. Yet some diesel car owners have reacted angrily, arguing they bought the vehicles because they were supposedly the environmentally friendly option.', 'Diesel vehicles burn less carbon dioxide (CO2) than gasoline cars to cover the same distance in highway conditions. However, they also emit potentially toxic particulate matter that has been shown to significantly impact public health.', 'Diesel engines emit less CO2 and greenhouse gases than petrol engines. This happens because of the particular type of fuel and the internal efficiency of the diesel engine. More specifically, the fuel used in diesel engines has a higher compression ratio than petrol and it also performs better than petrol engines. As a result, less fuel is used to travel the same distance, allowing to save more CO2. Most estimations indicate that diesel engines emit about 10% less than the petrol engines of the same category.', 'But even when governments were promoting diesel cars, we knew there were issues with toxic emissions (those immediately harmful to humans, not CO₂). Heating air in an engine produces nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) which include the toxic nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N₂O) and nitric oxide (NO), which reacts with oxygen to form NO₂. In a petrol car, these can be cleaned up by a three-way catalytic converter so that it emits on average around 30% less NOₓ than a diesel car, without after-treatment.']"
"Why and what are puppy mills and why are they bad? Why don't ""ethical"" breeders sell to pet stores?","Puppy mills are commercial breeding facilities that prioritize profit over the ethical treatment of animals[1][4]. Animals in puppy mills are treated as nothing more than a profit-making commodity and are often denied necessary medical care, leading to ill and suffering puppies being passed off as fit[1]. Inbreeding practices in these mills can also result in birth defects or other genetic disorders[1]. Furthermore, puppies from puppy mills often suffer from health issues and genetic defects[3]. Ethical breeders do not sell to pet stores because they want to ensure their puppies are not going to be used to support these substandard facilities.","['Animals in puppy mills are treated as nothing more than a profit-making commodity. It is hence very obvious that the mill runners do not bother about treating diseases in these animals. Ill and suffering puppies are often passed off and sold as fit, or meet their death in the mills itself. Sickness in breeding dogs that could pass on to the litter isn’t treated either. The rampant inbreeding practice gives birth to a variety of birth defects or other genetic disorders.', 'Puppy Mills are yet another man-made mess to meet his greed. Both, the breeder and the buyer are to be blamed for engaging in something so heinous. Puppy Mills are a societal evil whose effects go beyond pet-owning families. The responsibility to have them function in order and in compliance with laws, hence, lies on the shoulders of all of us, not just animal lovers or pet owners.', 'It can be common that pet stores source their puppies from puppy mills, which is why it’s best to avoid purchasing puppies from these shops. Because no care is given to the breeding process, puppy mill puppies often suffer from health issues and genetic defects.', 'Puppy mills are commercial breeding facilities that prioritize profit over the ethical treatment of animals. JethuynhCan / Getty Images', 'Most puppies in pet stores come from puppy mills. It\'s very common for people to view purchasing a puppy from a pet store as rescuing them from poor conditions, but this is not true. In most cases when a puppy is bought in a pet shop, the money is going to a puppy mill. While you are providing a home for the puppy you purchased, you are also most likely keeping a puppy mill in business and allowing them to keep other puppies and their parents in horrendous conditions. The pet store might also tell you that the puppy comes from a ""licensed breeder."" This does not mean that the puppy is from a responsible or ethical breeder. All it means is that the breeder has completed the necessary paperwork that allows them to operate as a business.']"
Why do people hunt rhinos for their horns? What do the horns have that you can't get elsewhere?,"People hunt rhinos for their horns because the horns are worth a lot of money due to their rarity and the fact that they are made of keratin, a protein found in our hair and fingernails, which is also able to grow back if trimmed. Additionally, the demand for rhino horns is independent of price[3][4]. Studies also suggest that humans have been killing rhinos with the largest horns, creating a selective pressure against more prominent outgrowths[2]. Lastly, illegal trafficking in rhino horn is pervasive throughout the industry, with people being blinded by greed and private sector complicity with gangs supplying horn to Asia[5].","['""Rhinos evolved their horns for a reason – different species use them in different ways such as helping to grasp food or to defend against predators – so we think that having smaller horns will be detrimental to their survival,"" explains Wilson.', 'The authors suspect that over time, humans have been killing rhinos with the largest horns, creating a selective pressure against more prominent outgrowths.', 'Additionally, studies done by illegal wildlife trade organisations show that the demand for rhino horn is independent of price, meaning people will buy it no matter how expensive it is.', 'The horn of a rhinoceros is the world’s most valuable appendage in an exotic marketplace that values nature’s oddities, such as elephant ivory, tiger penis, and giraffe tail. Unlike the horns of many species, including cattle, rhino horn is not made of bone. It is made of keratin, a protein also found in our hair and fingernails, and if you trim a rhino’s horn, it grows back. Although selling rhino horn is illegal, in South Africa if you have a permit, you can cut off a rhino’s horn. Every year or two South African rhino farmers tranquilize their animals with darts, cut as much as four pounds of horn from each rhino, and store it all in bank vaults and other secure locations, hoping for a day when it’s legal to sell horn.', 'Illegal trafficking in rhino horn does not seem to be confined to a single criminal syndicate or game farm. “A lot of people are gobsmacked by how pervasive that behavior is throughout the industry,” said Traffic’s Milliken. “People are just blinded by greed—your professional hunters, your veterinarians, the people who own these game ranches. We have never seen this level of private sector complicity with gangs supplying horn to Asia.”']"
"why do so many different Rx and OTC drugs, with wildly different purposes, all cause drowsiness?","One of the main reasons why so many different Rx and OTC drugs, with wildly different purposes, all cause drowsiness is because many of them contain antihistamines like diphenhydramine and doxylamine, which have undesirable anticholinergic effects and cause daytime sedation. These drugs are widely used for the induction of sleep and can have serious adverse effects, especially in older people[1][2]. Additionally, increased access to medications due to the Rx-to-OTC switch can lead to inaccurate self-diagnosis and lack of pharmacist vigilance, potentially leading to inappropriate use of OTC medications[3]. Stimulants like pseudoephedrine, phenylpropranolamine, and caffeine, which are also found in OTC medications, can cause insomnia[4]. Lastly, CNS depressants can be very dangerous when taken with other medications or alcohol, and can even lead to death[5].","['OTC sleeping medications are widely used for the induction of sleep. The active ingredients in these agents are antihistamines (diphenhydramine and doxylamine), and these drugs represent the most common use of antihistamines in OTC preparations. These histamine1 blockers have undesirable anticholinergic effects (e.g., dryness of the mouth, palpitations, dilation of pupils, tachycardia, difficulty in urination) and cause daytime sedation.', 'OTC drugs are not always better tolerated than similar prescription drugs. For example, the OTC sleep aid diphenhydramine can cause adverse effects that are just as serious as those associated with many prescription sleep aids, especially in older people.', 'One of the probable reasons for OTC abuse is increased access to medications. This is because medications for common illnesses are made accessible by prescription (Rx)-to-OTC switch.16 Most switches are driven by firm’s patent expiration. However, in case of prescription antihistamines like Claritin, Zyrtec, and Allegra, Blue Cross and their parent company petitioned the switch to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).17 Providing patients with autonomy, diagnosis of the condition on the patient’s judgment and the absence of a physician may lead to inaccurate self-diagnosis.5 For example, the availability of treatment for dyspepsia masks the presence of a severe gastrointestinal disease, which may not be diagnosed by patients.16 Lack of pharmacist vigilance may lead to long-term inappropriate use of OTC medications and hamper the health of patients.5', 'OTC medications include nasal decongestants and anorectics, which are stimulants (e.g., pseudoephedrine, phenylpropranolamine) and will cause insomnia. Caffeine, which is present in coffee, tea, colas, and chocolates, also is a stimulant and may promote wakefulness by blocking adenosine A2a receptors. As little as 150 mg of caffeine, which is the equivalent of 1–2 cups of coffee, may disturb sleep quality by increasing sleep latency and reducing total sleep time. During sleep deprivation, high doses of caffeine reduce total sleep time, increase stage 1 NREM sleep, and reduce SWS but do not affect neurocognitive functions.', ""CNS depressant abuse is risky too. Abruptly stopping or reducing them too quickly can lead to seizures. Taking CNS depressants with other medicines, such as prescription painkillers, some over-the-counter cold and allergy medicines, or alcohol can slow a person's heartbeat and breathing — and even kill.""]"
Domestication of animals,"Animal domestication is the process of selectively breeding and genetically adapting animals over generations to live alongside humans. It can be divided into three main groupings: domestication for companionship, animals farmed for food, and working or draft animals[1]. Generally speaking, domestic animals have to follow certain criteria[4], and since 2012, a multi-stage model of animal domestication has been accepted that details the slow, gradually intensifying relationship between humans and animals[5].","['Animal domestication falls into three main groupings: domestication for companionship (dogs and cats), animals farmed for food (sheep, cows, pigs, turkeys, etc.), and working or draft animals (horses, donkeys, camels).', 'The domestication of animals is the mutual relationship between non-human animals and the humans who have influence on their care and reproduction.', 'Domesticated animals are animals that have been selectively bred and genetically adapted over generations to live alongside humans.

Why are people worried about using growth hormones on animals to be eaten?,"People are worried about using growth hormones on animals to be eaten because there is a concern that adding natural and man-made hormones to the food supply may increase cancer risk, although this has never been studied[2]. There is also fear that manipulating growth hormones in animals may increase another hormone, insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which could mimic the effects of human growth hormone in harmful ways[3]. Additionally, growth hormones are not allowed in the food supply in the European Union[2][4], and there is confusion and concern about the potential effects of hormones on humans[2][3][5].","['Growth hormones are a central part of meat production. They are used to control growth, the amount of feed an animal requires, an animal’s milk production, as well as the production of fat and muscle. Treating animals with hormones can increase the worth of the meat and make animals cheaper to raise.', 'There are concerns that adding natural and man-made hormones to the food supply may increase cancer risk, but this has never been studied.

The actual fear is that manipulating growth hormones in cows—or salmon—may increase another hormone, insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which could mimic the effects of human growth hormone in harmful ways. In fact, research has found that milk from rBGH-treated cows contains up to 10 times more IGF than other milk."", 'In Canada, only cows used for beef are given growth hormones. Growth hormones are not used in dairy cows, pork, chicken, turkey or other meats. In the US, growth hormones are used in meat production and in dairy cattle. The use of growth hormones in food production is banned in the European Union.', 'Confusion and concern often surround the use of hormones in beef production. These “chemical messengers” are substances produced in the body that travel through the bloodstream to regulate body functions such as reproduction, metabolism, and growth. Hormones such as estrogens or androgens are often administered to growing cattle intended for slaughter to promote growth by complementing the effects of naturally occurring hormones. These growth-promoting hormones are generally administered to cattle in the form of small pellets, termed ‘implants’, that are placed under the skin in the animal’s ear. The boost in growth rate created by hormone implants allows for cattle to be finished earlier thereby requiring less time on feed and fewer resources per pound of meat produced.']"
"Why can't the prison system agree on a ""painless"" execution method, when any veterinarian in the country can painlessly put down a dog?","There are a number of reasons why the prison system cannot agree on a ""painless"" execution method when any veterinarian in the country can painlessly put down a dog. One reason is that the method relies on the cooperation of the prisoner, whereas the euthanasia of animals does not. Another reason is that there is no requirement for a state to demonstrate that a method of execution is not “cruel and unusual punishment”[2], so states can make up any method they want. Additionally, the lethal injection process has created a false distance between the reality of capital punishment and the public perception of capital punishment[3]. Furthermore, nitrogen hypoxia is not a quick method and can take at least seven minutes to put to death a pig[4], making it an inappropriate method for both animal and human euthanasia. Finally, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that prisoners failed to identify a less painful option[5], making it difficult for a ""painless"" execution method to be found.","['One of the primary issues is that the method relies on the cooperation of the prisoner: if they hold their breath, or their breathing is too shallow, it might take much longer to kill them. “I understand, of course, the theory behind it, that suggests it would be a humane method,” says McCracken. “But that is a far cry from how it would actually be performed in an execution chamber.”', 'There is no requirement for a state to demonstrate that a method of execution is not “cruel and unusual punishment,” as defined by the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, Lain says. Instead “the burden is on the condemned inmate to show that it is torturous rather than the burden being on the state to show that it’s not,” she says. “So the state can make up anything it wants.”', '“The lethal-injection process, in many respects, created a myth that what you had was a simple medical procedure in which the prisoner was put to sleep,” Dunham says. “That created a false distance between the reality of capital punishment and the public perception of capital punishment.”', 'Robert Dunham, a litigator and the Executive Director of the Death Penalty Information Center, certainly thinks so. “The American Veterinary Medical Association and World Animal Protection both say that nitrogen hypoxia is inappropriate for veterinary euthanasia,” he says. “It’s not quick as has been advertised – cats and dogs are aware of their impending death before they lose consciousness and it takes at least seven minutes to put to death a pig.”', 'There have been court cases in several states brought by prisoners claiming that lethal injection violates the Eighth Amendment. In the highest-profile case, four Oklahoma prisoners contended that using midazolam constituted cruel and unusual punishment because it “fails to render a person insensate to pain.” But in a 2015 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5–4 against the inmates, in part because, the justices said, they had failed to identify a less painful option.']"
"When cloning an animal (let's say a dog), how much of that cloned animal is exactly the same as the original animal?","A cloned animal has a very good chance of looking like the original animal, but it is impossible to guarantee that it will look exactly the same. Even if two animals have the same genes, the living thing's environment can affect how its looks and behavior develop[2]. Additionally, cloning can increase the variability associated with some traits[3], and there is no way to guarantee that a clone will have the same personality and behavior as the original animal[2][4][5]. Furthermore, many scientists remain uncomfortable with the whole premise of pet cloning, since the resulting animals will not have the same behavioural characteristics and personalities as the original creature[5].","['A clone is an identical copy of an organism created using the original organism’s DNA—a molecule that carries hereditary information—as a blueprint. Scottish scientists cloned the first mammal in 1996. It was a sheep, named Dolly. The cloning of other mammals, such as mice, pigs, and cats, soon followed (see Cloning Timeline). The first dog was cloned in South Korea in 2005. Scientists there soon began cloning pet dogs.', 'Some might argue that people gain a huge benefit. They get the chance to reconnect with an animal just like the one they once loved so dearly. But after people pay the high price to re-form this bond, they could end up disappointed. A cloned animal has a very good chance of looking like the first dog. But no one knows if a clone will look exactly the same. Units of hereditary material, called genes, can work in different ways. That’s true even between animals with the same genes. A living thing’s environment can also greatly affect how its looks and behavior develop.', 'In the physical study, the pigs were compared using a series of physiological and genetic parameters. The results indicated that while cloning creates animals within the normal phenotype – the appearance of an organism with respect to a group of characters – it increases the variability associated with some traits. ""That means that you can\'t use cloned animals to reduce the size of groups involved in animal experiments,"" Piedrahita said.', 'Such complications also suggest why it might not be a good idea to clone a beloved pet. Even if a clone is nearly genetically identical to the original, it will still grow up with its own personality and behavior. Because of differences in diet before birth and as it grows up, it could end up a different size and have a different pattern of coat color. There’s really no way to get a favorite pet back through cloning.', 'However, many scientists remain uncomfortable about the whole premise. Lovell-Badge argues that there is ""no justification"" for pet cloning as while the resulting animals will be genetically identical, they will not have the same behavioural characteristics and personalities as all creatures are a product of both genes and their environment.']"
"If a person's heart stops, and blood stops going to their organs, they become brain dead, and then dead dead; why can't we just pump oxygenated blood through them artificially after an hour or so, to revive them? Why do they stay dead?","Even if a person is put on a ventilator, which allows the body and heart to be artificially oxygenated, they won't regain consciousness or be able to start breathing again[1]. When the heart stops, the flow of oxygen to the organs, including the brain, is cut off, resulting in brain damage within minutes[2][4]. Although research has suggested that organs could be saved and used for transplants after one hour postischemia[3], this is not the case when it comes to reviving a person who is brain dead. Brain death occurs when a critically ill patient dies sometime after being placed on life support[4][5], and the heart can continue to beat while the ventilator delivers oxygen to the lungs, but the person is still considered dead[5]. Therefore, it is not possible to revive them.","[""Confirming death is now more complex, because it's possible to keep the heart beating after the brain stem has permanently stopped functioning.

So we chose to try it in the whole body, one hour postischemia [after blood flow stops], and we can basically replicate the cell-saving findings of the original study. It’s still in its inception, but there is at least an idea now that these organs could be saved and used for transplants.', ""Over the past 15 years, as the shortage of organs for transplantation has become more acute, there has been an increasing emphasis on donation after cardiac death (DCD). Patients who have severe brain injuries but who are not brain dead may still be organ donors if the patient, by advance directive, or the patient's family decides that life support should be withdrawn. After that decision is made, consent for organ donation is obtained. The patient is brought to the operating room, life support is withdrawn, and when the heart stops after a few minutes to an hour without ventilation or other support, the physician observes the patient for a few minutes to ensure that the heart does not start beating again spontaneously. If there continues to be no circulation for 2–5 minutes, the physician pronounces the patient dead. At this point, the transplant team enters the operating room and removes organs, usually the kidneys and liver, from the now dead patient.9"", 'Brain death is not the same as coma, because someone in a coma is unconscious but still alive. Brain death occurs when a critically ill patient dies sometime after being placed on life support. This situation can occur after, for example, a heart attack or stroke. The heart continues to beat while the ventilator delivers oxygen to the lungs (the heart can initiate its own beating without nerve impulses from the brain) but, despite the beating heart and warm skin, the person is dead. Since the brain has stopped working, the person won’t breathe if the ventilator is switched off.']"

How do aquired tastes work?,"Acquired tastes are flavors that humans aren't predisposed to like, such as broccoli, hot sauce, beer, pickles, ginger, dark chocolate, miso, and yogurt[2]. People are born liking sweet foods and drinks and show an innate aversion to heat, bitterness, and other strong flavors[2]. Acquired tastes are acquired through cultural and social learning, meaning if all the people around us are enjoying a certain food, we want to enjoy it too and are more willing to try it[4]. Adolescence is a critical time for taste preferences because of peer influence[4][5]. Basically, acquired taste is a mind game, and if you try something a bunch of times, you can condition yourself to like it[4].","['Acquired tastes are part of practically every culture’s cuisine and some of the world’s most beloved dishes. Without expanding beyond innate preferences in their diet, humans wouldn’t be able to get the nutrients they need to survive. But there’s a good reason people aren’t born with a taste for bitter vegetables and fermented foods. Without knowing any better, seeking out these flavors could be deadly.', 'Humans are born liking sweet foods and drinks, and they show an innate aversion to heat, bitterness, and other strong flavors. In other words, acquired taste isn’t limited to durian, liver, anchovies, and other foods that are polarizing among adults. Any food preference that doesn’t appeal to our most basic, ingrained desires has been acquired. That means broccoli, hot sauce, beer, pickles, ginger, dark chocolate, miso, and yogurt are all acquired tastes.', 'Paul Rozin, a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, defines acquired taste as any taste that humans aren’t predisposed to like. ""You\'re starting out with a little library of innate preferences and aversions,"" he tells Mental Floss. ""So most of the rest of what you have are acquired likes and dislikes.""', ""There's rarely spicy or funky foods on a kids menu, so young ones are not familiar with these flavors and believe they don't like them. According to Mental Floss, if humans didn't acquire tastes outside of the sweet flavors we are all born to love, we wouldn't get enough nutrients to survive. Luckily, most acquired tastes happen passively via cultural and social learning. If all the people around us are enjoying a certain food, we want to enjoy it too and are more willing to try it. Mental Floss explains that adolescence is a critical time for taste preferences because we are most susceptible to peer influence. Basically, acquired taste is a mind game. If you think you don't like something and avoid it, nothing will change — but if you try it a bunch of times, you can condition yourself to like it."", ""People can acquire tastes at any age, and not much research has been done into when these preferences tend to evolve. Anecdotally, at least, adolescence seems to be a critical time. At this point in life, people are very susceptible to peer influence, which may be one of the biggest factors driving acquired taste. “If people you like like a flavor, that tends to make you like it,” Rozin says. “If your peers do it, that's very important. If heroes like Hollywood people do it, it tends to make you like it. Not always, but it tends to.” So if you grew up watching your older brother eating hot wings, or Anthony Bourdain eating offal, that could explain why you enjoy those foods as an adult.""]"
How do animals have multiple births at a time and humans(most of the time) only have one,"The frequency of multiple births in humans is relatively rare compared to other animals[1][2][3]. This is because most animals have high fecundity, or the ability to produce a large number of offspring[3]. This is an adaptation that increases the chances of having at least one offspring survive to adulthood to carry on the genetics of the parent[3]. Animals that produce multiple offspring at a time are usually fraternal twins (or triplets, quadruplets or quintuplets) and not identical twins[4]. For example, sheep, goats, and deer all regularly give birth to fraternal twins[5]. Humans, on the other hand, usually only give birth to one baby at a time.[3][5]","['A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy, wherein the mother gives birth to two or more babies. A term most applicable to vertebrate species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets. In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter, and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.', 'multiple birth, the delivery of more than one offspring in a single birth event. In most mammals the litter size is fairly constant and is roughly correlated with, among other features, body size, gestation period, life span, type of uterus, and number of teats. For example, a large mammal with a normal pregnancy of more than 150 days, a life span of more than 20 years, a simple (or unicornuate) uterus, and two breasts rarely bears more than one young (a singleton) at a birth. The great majority of primates, humans included, fit into this category; multiple births among them are exceptional and occur with decreasing frequency from twins on.', 'Having high fecundity is an adaptation of many wildlife species. It is unusual for humans to have more than one baby at a time. However many wild animals have multiple babies at once. In fact, all animals produce more offspring than can survive long enough to reproduce themselves. This increases the likelihood that at least one offspring will survive to adulthood to carry on the genetics of the parent.', 'So that’s humans covered, but what about twins in the animal kingdom? Keeping in mind these different categories, the answer should be fairly obvious. Whenever an animal gives birth to multiple young, the offspring are fraternal twins. Well, if not twins then fraternal triplets, quadruplets or quintuplets. You get my point!', 'On the other hand, some animals rarely give birth to litters, and instead nearly always bear two young with each pregnancy. In these animals, two babies born at the same time are called twins, not littermates. However, these are usually fraternal, not identical twins.

Why are mammals (seemingly) so much more intelligent than other animals?,"There is no clear correlation between absolute or relative brain size and intelligence[4], so it is not necessarily the size of the brain that determines intelligence. Other factors such as evolutionary quotient (EQ) must also be taken into account[4]. Mammals are generally considered more intelligent than other animals due to our cultural and personal biases. Humans are arguably the most intelligent creatures on Earth, as we are able to solve novel problems[3][4], while other animals are mainly able to solve problems related to their particular habitats[3]. It is believed that all biological organisms have some level of intelligence, as they all need to solve the problems they face in life[5].","['Our understanding of, and feelings for and against different species seem to be linked to our cultural and personal prejudices. We have compassion for those closely related to us. Mammals are viewed smarter than birds and reptiles, while we think of less related species, like insects, as non-thinking machines.', 'Within mammals, monkeys have much smaller brains than ungulates, and humans have much smaller brains than whales and elephants, while they are, without any doubt, more intelligent . However, there are groups like primates, where ‘bigger is better’ appears to hold. Nevertheless, there remains the question: why are bigger brains not uniformly smarter?', 'Even though we humans write the textbooks and may justifiably be suspected of bias, few doubt that we are the smartest creatures on the planet. Many animals have special cognitive abilities that allow them to excel in their particular habitats, but they do not often solve novel problems. Some of course do, and we call them intelligent, but none are as quick-witted as we are.', 'There is no clear correlation between absolute or relative brain size and intelligence. Assuming that absolute brain size is decisive for intelligence, then whales or elephants should be more intelligent than humans, and horses more intelligent than chimpanzees, which definitely is not the case. If it were relative brain size that counted for intelligence, then shrews should be the most intelligent mammals, which nobody believes. If we take the EQ into account, some inconsistencies are removed; then humans are on top, but many other inconsistencies remain, for example that gorillas have a rather low EQ, but are considered highly intelligent, while capuchin monkeys and dolphins have unusually high EQs, but are not considered to be as intelligent as gorillas. Thus, other factors have to be considered.', 'From our closest relatives, like other primates and mammals, to animals far from us on the evolutionary tree, like birds and insects, all biological organisms have some level of intelligence. To be successful, they all need to solve the problems they face in life.']"
Why is tap dancing so ubiquitous in old musicals?,"Tap dancing was ubiquitous in old musicals because it was the quintessential style of American theatrical dance[2]. It was popularized by early tappers like Fred Astaire who provided a more ballroom look to tap dancing, while Gene Kelly introduced ballet elements and style into tap which created the Broadway style that is popular in American culture today[4]. Tap was used as a symbol of razzle-dazzle and insincere corruptness[1][5] and also as a sparkly outfit and symbol of Broadway's past[1][2][5].","['By the 1970s, tap seemed passé and out of place in musicals, unless someone like Bob Fosse used it as a symbol of razzle-dazzle, insincere and corrupt. Since then, except for incursions by Gregory Hines and Savion Glover, who temporarily reconnected tap on Broadway both with its African-American roots and with contemporary coolness, tap in musicals has been almost exclusively a period dance.', 'hroughout much of the 20th century, tap dancing was the quintessential style of American theatrical dance. Edwin Denby, America’s foremost ballet critic, wrote in 1943 that “tap dancing is what we think of as a natural way of dancing in this country.” But while it continues to be seen on Broadway, it is no longer predominant in theatrical choreography and is now all but invisible (and inaudible) in movies and on TV. The diminished cultural status of tap was underlined by the 2015 Broadway revival of Dames at Sea, a 1966 homage to the tap-oriented movie musicals of the 1930s. Unlike the original off-Broadway production, which ran for 575 performances, this one received lukewarm reviews and closed after two months.', 'But even if tap continues to remain marginal to American popular culture, we will still have the studio-system film musicals in which its possibilities were documented for all time. To see Astaire, Bill Robinson, or the Nicholas Brothers performing on screen is to know that tap dancing at its best is not merely a skill but a true art.', 'Early tappers like Fred Astaire provided a more ballroom look to tap dancing, while Gene Kelly introduced ballet elements and style into tap. This style of tap led to what is today known as Broadway style, which is popular in American culture. It often involves high heeled tap shoes and show music, and is usually the type of tap first taught to beginners. Examples of this style are found in Broadway musicals such as Anything Goes and 42nd Street.', 'But to complain about insufficient originality is almost to miss the point. Tap isn’t being used as a dance language here, much less as music. It’s being used as a sparkly outfit, and as a symbol of Broadway’s past.']"
What exactly makes different type of animal meat taste different than the other animals?,"The taste of different types of animal meat varies due to several factors. The evolutionary origin of the animal is one factor, as suggested by Joe Staton of the Museum of Comparative Zoology[1]. This is why certain tetrapods, such as amphibians, reptiles, and certain birds, largely taste like chicken. The relatedness of species also affects their meat's taste[1], so the meat from two different placental mammals would likely taste more similar than poultry. Wild or older animals tend to have different sources for fat, which gives them a more distinctive (""gamey"") flavor[3]. Fish meat tastes different mostly due to fats/oils distributed throughout the body, and the structure of the muscles tends to create a flaky texture[3]. Reptiles and amphibians can also ""taste like chicken""[1][4], and expectations can also have a great impact on our experience of flavor in food[5].","['Another suggestion, made by Joe Staton of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, is that meat flavors are fixed based on the ""evolutionary origin"" of the animal. Specifically, he noted that certain tetrapods, particularly amphibians, reptiles and certain birds, largely taste like chicken, whereas other animals usually do not. Accordingly, birds (the most numerous form of meat by type) would (in most cases) naturally taste more like chicken than mammals.[clarification needed] Furthermore, because dinosaurs are ancestral to birds, their meat would hypothetically have also tasted like chicken. However, the meat of other fowl often tastes nothing like chicken; for example, pheasant meat is described as a ""unique"" flavor and ostrich meat is considered very similar to beef. In fact, duck is often considered a red meat. Birds of prey are reported to taste different.', ""Does the relatedness of species affect their meat's taste? For example would the meat from two different placental mammals taste more similar to each other than meat from poultry?"", 'Thus, wild or older animals are more likely to have different sources for fat (and more marbled fat mixed into muscle), which gives it a more distinctive (""gamey"") flavor. Fish meat tastes a lot different mostly due to fats/oils distributed throughout (instead of in pockets like most higher vertebrates), and the structure of the muscles tends to create a flaky texture due to different usage and less connective tissue. There are also distinctive chemicals (particularly in the fat) that give fish its characteristic ""fishy"" flavor, but when you encounter very ""mild"" fish, it\'s the texture and fat distribution that makes it most different from another white meat.', 'There\'s a reason that many people say lots of random meats taste like chicken. Since muscle structure is often quite similar even in very unrelated animals, a lot of reptile and amphibian meat can ""taste like chicken."" The texture is often different, because muscles may be used in different ways, but if you put the meat through a meat grinder, the flavor wouldn\'t be as varied. (Thus alligator sausage is not as adventurous or odd tasting as you might think at first.)', 'One last thing I would mention is expectations. Many, many studies have shown that pre-existing assumptions can have a great impact on our experience of flavor in food. (Expensive food tends to be rated as ""tasting better,"" for example, even if the same exact dish is sold at different prices.) The combination of a ""weird meat"" expectation and a slightly different texture can often make the distinctions between meat flavor seem greater than they are. If you put the various meats (of similar color) through a grinder and then prepare them the same way, you might be surprised at how small the differences are between various animals.']"
How animals seems to have the sense from birth that fire is bad but humans often have to get burned before realising?,"Animals have an instinctive sense from birth that fire is dangerous, whereas humans often have to get burned before realising that it is dangerous. This is because animals can respond to fire in a number of ways such as avoiding it, associating with its aftermath, habituating to it, or interacting with it[3]. Chimpanzees, orangutans, and other animals are capable of pyrocognition and using fire in various ways, such as lighting cigarettes with matches, removing cloth that had been set alight, and raking objects from it[2]. Furthermore, some birds like black kites have even been observed to pick up burning embers and drop them elsewhere, which might increase their chances of catching a meal[5]. This suggests that humans may have learned to manage landscapes with fire by watching birds.[5]","['Yet it seems humans weren’t alone in our use of fire. Evidence is mounting that other animals are capable of pyrocognition, the behavioural and cognitive abilities required to harness the potential of fire. This means that examining the way nonhuman animals interact with and live alongside fire can help us shed light on how our long-extinct ancestors managed this dangerous phenomenon, and how it went on to shape the creatures we are today.', 'The few kinds of animals that interact with fire provide clues about how our ancestors might have done it. In the middle of the 20th century, when chimpanzees living in zoos were often given cigarettes, they would light the correct end with burning matches, avoid combustible materials, extinguish cigarettes in wet patches, remove cloth that had been set alight, and use fruit peels to handle hot residues. They also used sticks to inspect fire and rake objects from it. After observing humans, an orangutan even attempted to light a stick by holding a burning one against it, and put fuel and sticks on glowing embers.', 'Animals can respond to fire in a number of ways: they avoid it; they associate with its aftermath; they get used to it (‘habituate’); or they interact with it. Fire is fast and destructive, so why don’t all animals avoid it? In fact, some gain advantages from associating with burned landscapes. For instance, wolves benefit from the reduced vegetation cover and increased abundance of prey, which are attracted to new sprouts taking root. Habituation, on the other hand, means the more animals are exposed to fire, the more normally they behave when close to it. Savannah chimpanzees and vervet monkeys frequently experience wildfires, for example, and travel, groom and forage close to it while remaining calm. Wildfires open up the landscape, which makes it easier to forage, travel and spot predators.', 'But attitudes to fire don’t account for how it is controlled and understood. Anatomically modern humans, with their large brains and adaptations for cooked food, are not ideal analogues for the first hominins who began to use fire. Instead, we might look to the behaviour of animals, particularly primates, which share many cognitive, ecological, social and morphological similarities with extinct hominins. This cross-species approach has examined the shared roots of hominin abilities such as language, culture, sociality, and tool use – but very little has been done on fire-related behaviour. Examining and teasing apart the response of animals and humans to fire can therefore inform our understanding of how extinct hominins behaved towards fire – and eventually learned to use, control, and create it.', 'These anecdotal observations suggest that great apes can at least grasp the ‘dos’ and ‘don’ts’ of fire. Some birds can, too. Black kites and other Australian raptors follow smoke trails and gather near wildfires in large numbers to hunt escaping insects, reptiles and mammals. Some of them even pick up burning embers and drop them elsewhere, which might increase their chances of catching a meal by causing animals to flee. The most complex fire-related behaviour in the wild, in fact, comes not from our primate cousins, but from our distant feathered relatives, with whom we share a last common ancestor some 320 million years ago. The unique behaviour of these ‘firehawks’ is featured in traditional Indigenous stories, which raises the possibility that humans learned to manage landscapes with fire by watching birds.']"

"what's stopping me from naming random people as my heirs, in my will, when i pass and leaving my debts to them?","It is not possible to name random people as your heirs in your will and leave your debts to them.

"Why is it that sometimes I'll wake up congested and sneezy even when I'm not sick, and it'll go away as the day goes on?","Waking up congested and sneezy even when you're not sick can be caused by allergies, sinusitis[3], nonallergic rhinitis[4], or the flu[1][2][3][5]. Allergies can cause the immune system to overreact and cause the tiny capillary blood vessels in the nose to leak fluid, leading to congestion. Pollen counts are at their highest in the morning, so if you're outdoors during this time you may start sniffling and sneezing[1]. Nonallergic rhinitis can also trigger morning allergy symptoms like congestion[4]. The flu can also lead to head congestion by infecting your nose, throat, and lungs, and causing nasal swelling[5]. The symptoms may go away as the day goes on because the allergen or virus may not be present during other parts of the day.","['Allergy is a very common cause for people to wake up with a blocked nose, or nasal congestion as it might be called. If air pollution such as pollen, dust, mould spores or traffic soot is being inhaled, they can cause an over-reaction of the immune system - which can then manifest itself into allergy symptoms. In this response, antibodies are produced and cause the symptoms of congestion because they make the tiny capillary blood vessels in the nose leak fluid. Your nose feels blocked up, it becomes harder to breathe and you might wake up with a blocked nose, and sometimes even a headache.', 'This is because pollen counts are at their highest in the morning. So, if you’re outdoors during this time of day — walking the dog, going for an early morning run, or getting ready for work — you may start sniffling, sneezing, and coughing upon stepping outdoors.', 'Some of the non-allergic causes that might make you wake up with a blocked nose, are sinusitis, colds and flu, nasal polyps and a condition called vasomotor rhinitis.', 'Allergy symptoms in the morning aren’t only caused by allergens, though.

Can animals become feral?,"Yes, animals can become feral. Feral animals are domesticated species released into the wild. Examples of animals with feral populations are horses, dogs, goats, cats, rabbits, camels, and pigs[1][3]. Feral animals can cause serious problems, such as competing with domestic livestock, degrading fences, water sources, and vegetation, and passing on transmissible infections to domestic herds[4].","['Pets and feral animals can be a hazard for wildlife. Feral animals belong to a domesticated species like cats and horses, but live wild. Often they are the offspring of animals that belonged to people but were either let loose or escaped from confinement. Feral animals have few predators, and their populations can grow quite large. There are an estimated 50 million feral cats in the United States.', 'When animals become feral due to human neglect or accidental release, they can cause serious problems. Feral animals are domesticated species released into the wild. Many land managers in the West (including the Black Mountain area of northwest Arizona, a fragile desert environment susceptible to over-grazing) consider burros to be one of those problem species.', 'A feral animal is one that has escaped from a domestic or captive status and is living more or less as a wild animal, or one that is descended from such animals. Other definitions include animals that have changed from being domesticated to being wild, natural, or untamed. Some common examples of animals with feral populations are horses, dogs, goats, cats, rabbits, camels, and pigs. Zoologists generally exclude from the feral category animals that were genuinely wild before they escaped from captivity: neither lions escaped from a zoo nor the white-tailed eagles re-introduced to the UK are regarded as feral.', 'Feral animals compete with domestic livestock, and may degrade fences, water sources, and vegetation (by overgrazing or introducing seeds of invasive plants). Although hotly disputed, some cite as an example the competition between feral horses and cattle in the western United States. Another example is of goats competing with cattle in Australia, or goats that degrade trees and vegetation in environmentally-stressed regions of Africa. Accidental crossbreeding by feral animals may result in harm to breeding programs of pedigreed animals; their presence may also excite domestic animals and push them to escape. Feral populations can also pass on transmissible infections to domestic herds. Loss to farmers by aggressive feral dog population is common in India.', 'Certain familiar animals go feral easily and successfully, while others are much less inclined to wander and usually fail promptly outside domestication. Some species will detach readily from humans and pursue their own devices, but do not stray far or spread readily. Others depart and are gone, seeking out new territory or range to exploit and displaying active invasiveness. Whether they leave readily and venture far, the ultimate criterion for success is longevity. Persistence depends on their ability to establish themselves and reproduce reliably in the new environment. Neither the duration nor the intensity with which a species has been domesticated offers a useful correlation with its feral potential.[citation needed]']"
"Are honeybees in danger? If so, how much danger are they in, and why should I care?","Although honeybees are not endangered, their rapid decline is a cause for concern.

Wouldn't it be wonderful if our company was first to produce a cancer-free cigarette. What we could do to competition!’ Another remarked on how fortunate it was ‘for us’ (ie, for cigarette manufacturers) that smokers were engaging in ‘a habit they can't break’.24 The mid-1950s cancer consensus was clearly (albeit privately) shared by the companies; and the reality of addiction was also starting to be conceded—at least in internal industry documents."", 'There is a treasure trove of bogus old ads, viewable online, featuring claims by tobacco companies that cigarettes pose no health risks, or even that they’re beneficial in aiding digestion . This was the tobacco industry’s response to the research surfacing in the 1940s linking smoking to cancer. Their answer was to fund “studies” of their own to “prove” that tobacco smoking was safe. Some companies paid doctors to claim their cigarettes were somehow “healthier” than the competition . This history exposes how disingenuous marketing and fake research can mislead the public for decades.

New technology allowed cigarettes to be produced on a large scale, and advertising glamorized smoking. The military got in on it too – giving cigarettes out for free to soldiers during World Wars I and II.', ""A similar kind of tedium can be observed in the expert testimony of historians working for the industry, which tends to centre around the establishment of two key principles: (1) everyone has always known about tobacco hazards, meaning of course that people have only themselves to blame for taking up the habit; and (2) no one was ever really able to prove that cigarettes are harmful, or at least not until quite late, say, with the Surgeon General's Report of 1964 or even later.

"Mosquitos are key vectors in the spread of many (malaria, West Nile virus, dengue, etc.). How would wiping them off the face of the earth negatively affect various ecosystems?","Wiping mosquitos off the face of the earth would have a significant impact on various ecosystems, as mosquitoes are key vectors for the spread of many diseases, such as malaria, West Nile virus, and dengue[1]. Mosquitoes act as a link between humans and animals, allowing diseases to be transferred between them. Temperature is a key driver in the transmission of these diseases, as it affects the physiology and life histories of mosquitoes, which in turn affects the mosquito biting rate and probability of becoming infectious[3]. Mosquitoes also play an important role in the transmission of West Nile virus, as their host preference and host density are important drivers of the virus’s transmission dynamics[5]. Removing them from the equation could have disastrous consequences for human and animal health.","['Mosquitoes can transmit diverse infectious pathogens and parasites that cause diseases such as dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, West Nile fever, or malaria. Therefore, the mosquitoes are so-called disease vectors. In order to do so, though, a mosquito must bite a sick human first, thereby infecting itself with the pathogen. After some time (usually around ten days), the mosquito itself becomes infectious. However, not every mosquito can transmit every pathogen. For example, the malaria pathogen can only be transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito species, whereas tiger mosquitoes are the vectors of dengue fever. Naturally, the specialization in different hosts has an influence on the diseases that a mosquito species can transmit. For example, the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, is strongly specialized in humans and their surroundings. That is why it is a highly efficient vector of various diseases affecting humans: yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are among these.', 'Livestock are main reservoir/amplification hosts, and suffer mortality and abortion after being infected by mosquitoes. Most transmission to humans occurs via direct contact with infected livestock. Vertical transmission in vectors (via dormant eggs) can initiate epidemics. In eastern and southern Africa, there are large epidemics every 5–15 years driven by rainfall and blooms of Ae. spp. from low-lying flooded areas known as dambos.', 'Temperature is a key driver of transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. Both mosquitoes and the pathogens they transmit are ectotherms whose physiology and life histories depend strongly on environmental temperature (Johnson et al., 2015; Mordecai et al., 2019; Mordecai et al., 2017; Mordecai et al., 2013; Paull et al., 2017; Rogers and Randolph, 2006; Shocket et al., 2018; Tesla et al., 2018). These temperature-dependent traits drive the biological processes required for transmission. For example, temperature-dependent fecundity, development, and mortality of mosquitoes determine whether vectors are present in sufficient numbers for transmission. Temperature also affects the mosquito biting rate on hosts and probability of becoming infectious.', 'Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection and is endemic in many tropical and subtropical regions in the world . Since 1970 dengue has rapidly spread and can be found in more than 100 countries in regions of the world including the Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asian and Western Pacific . Temperature affects the extrinsic incubation period of the Aedes mosquito  and rainfall is also one of the most important environmental factors that affects the vector’s reproduction cycle. The vector abundance can be influenced by rainfall events by increasing the availability of mosquito juvenile habitats (e.g., containers in the patio with standing water)  and drought conditions can increase the larval habitat by increasing household water storage .', 'We agree that mosquito host preference and host density are important drivers of mosquito-borne disease in general, and West Nile virus transmission dynamics specifically. Our model isolates the direct (physiological) effects of temperature on vectors and viruses alone and does not incorporate these host factors. We have now expanded our discussion of this issue (Discussion section), quoted below:']"

"If humans are natural predators, why don't most possess a natural desire to hunt? And why do some feel remorse after taking an animals life?","Humans have evolved to understand and empathize with animals, and in some cases, feel remorse after taking an animal's life. This is likely because, unlike other natural predators, humans have a rich history of hunting and gathering and have had the opportunity to develop an emotional connection with animals. Additionally, anti-hunters often rely on timeworn myths when they react so negatively to hunters[3]. Also, while animals may appear to endure suffering calmly, predators deliberately target sick and injured individuals, which means those prey that appear sick or injured are the ones killed most often[4]. Finally, humans are unique in that they nurture some animals in order to eat them, and in doing so, may even do better than God[5].","['Similar studies have shown that animals react very strongly to the perceived presence of spiders, hawks, sharks, and wolves. But what about humans? We kill many animals at much higher rates than their other natural predators, and we’re unusual in taking out those predators too. “We might expect animals to fear us, as any prey fears its predators,” says Suraci.', 'It does seem strange, if you’re unfamiliar with us, to think that hunters could both love animals, yet shoot them and eat them. Hundreds of years ago, feeling affection for animals was probably a luxury that most people couldn’t afford. People were too busy hunting and gathering to think about or subscribe feelings and emotions to animals. They just saw their next source of a meal.', 'Now, why anti-hunters don’t want any animals to die, ever, is a much more complex story. It’s pretty safe to say that most of them don’t understand the natural world the way devoted hunters do. Anti-hunters probably haven’t seen the violent way predators like coyotes, bobcats, and wolves bring down their prey. In fact, it is safe to say that anti-hunters rely on some timeworn myths when they react so negatively to hunters.', ""And while many animals appear to endure such conditions rather calmly, this doesn't necessarily mean they aren't suffering.[BourneEtAl] Sick and injured members of a prey species are the easiest to catch, so predators deliberately target these individuals. As a consequence, those prey that appear sick or injured will be the ones killed most often. Thus, evolutionary pressure pushes prey species to avoid drawing attention to their suffering.[Nuffield, ch. 4.12, p. 66]"", 'Human beings are in fact a rare light in the darkness of the animal kingdom when we nurture some animals in order to eat them. Many domesticated animals are bred and raised for food in conditions that should be the envy of wild animals. The daily life of some of the animals we eat is almost like a spa! If vegetarians and vegans are the natural enemies of domesticated animals, carnivorous human beings are their natural friends. Indeed, in nurturing and caring for animals that we raise for food or other purposes, human beings seem to do better than God.']"
When sheep run away from their herd they grow several pounds of wool. So how do wild sheep now get weighed down and die?,"Wild sheep can become weighed down and die when their overgrown wool impedes their movement and prevents them from grazing or running from predators[1]. Additionally, unshorn wool can cause the sheep to overheat in the summer months and make them the target for parasitic species, like ticks and mites[3]. Moreover, wild sheep are more vulnerable to predation and starvation since they are not in a protected environment and have limited access to food[5].","['Without shearing, overgrown wool can even develop into “wool blindness” which is a condition that impairs the animal’s sight —and because sheep are prey animals, their sight is necessary for survival. If shearing is neglected, sheep become so heavy with wool that they have trouble walking or running, their ability to graze becomes compromised, and they cannot keep up with the flock for protection, or run from predators. Shearing is also critical to the survival of lambs, particularly in longwool breeds whose lambs need to quickly find their mother’s teats to nurse — sadly, lambs can die of starvation when there is too much wool in the way.', 'Sheep in the wild often grow thicker coats to keep them warm. In this case, they don’t need shearing. The wool can be so thick that it keeps the sheep too warm, so they shed their extra wool when the weather is warm.', 'Shearing is crucial to sheep’s health, as a large animal veterinarian will tell you. Dr. Jen Burton, a vet with 10 years of experience specializing in the health and welfare of sustainable livestock, explains “I can’t imagine a veterinarian suggesting that wool be left to grow on a domestic sheep, because that would put the animal at risk for overheating, discomfort and disease. The animal would also be at increased risk for skin disease and parasites. Over time, unshorn wool could eventually impede movement.” Sheep can overheat and die in the summer months if not shorn, and become the target for parasitic species such as ticks, lice, mites, and the maggots that cause fly strike, a gruesome and even deadly condition. Shearing provides both prevention and treatment of any of these infestations.', 'Sheep usually live in herds of about 20-30 individuals. It makes them targets for predators, such as wolves and coyotes who hunt in packs. When there’s a threat nearby, sheep will rush towards the center of the herd where it’s harder for predators to attack an individual animal.', 'Wild sheep don’t have a long lifespan as compared to domesticated sheep. But, most species live for about ten to twelve years in the wild. Domestic sheep live longer than their wild counterparts. It’s because they are better protected from predators and have more access to food. Wild sheep are more likely to die from predation or starvation than natural causes.']"
Why does Japan practice whaling?,"Japan practices whaling for several reasons. One is the country's long-stated goal of 'food security'[1]. Another is regulatory capture, which is the process by which a regulatory agency is controlled by those it is meant to regulate. Japan's whaling industry also continues due to its being a political constituency issue for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his allies[3]. Additionally, Japan argues that hunting and eating whales are part of its culture[4], and the government insists that eating whale is an important part of Japan's food culture[5].","['Another explanation for whaling given by the industry is Japan’s long-stated goal of ‘food security,’a notion supported by the University of Adelaide’s Rathus.', '‘Regulatory capture is the reason Japan’s whaling industry continues, and it’s hard to see it escaping this,’ he says.‘As a share of government spending, the whaling subsidies are very, very insignificant, and clearly certain districts in the whaling areas near the coast which are held by the ruling party have a strong domestic political interest in keeping it going.', '‘Indeed this move is more about propping up a nationalistic agenda by Japan’s leaders, with whaling being a political constituency issue for the Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his allies.’', 'Like other whaling nations, Japan argues hunting and eating whales are part of its culture. A number of coastal communities in Japan have indeed hunted whales for centuries but consumption only became widespread after World War Two when other food was scarce.', 'The country has been whaling for hundreds of years and the government insists eating whale is an important part of Japan’s food culture.']"
Why do are some areas or towns have the name Kill or Kills in them? Was it old tyme English for slaughterhouse areas or the industry that started the town?,"The term ""Kills"" or ""Kill"" originates from Old Norse and was used to describe a place where animals were slaughtered, usually for food. The term ""slaughterhouse"" is derived from the same root and refers to a place where animals are killed on a large scale[1][3]. In some societies, traditional cultural and religious aversion to slaughter led to prejudice against the people involved[2]. The slaughterhouse emerged as a coherent institution in the 19th century due to health and social concerns, as well as criticisms of the practice on the grounds that the effect that killing had, both on the butchers and the observers, ""educated the men in the practice of violence and cruelty""[5].","['Until modern times, the slaughter of animals generally took place in a haphazard and unregulated manner in diverse places. Early maps of London show numerous stockyards in the periphery of the city, where slaughter occurred in the open air or under cover such as wet markets. A term for such open-air slaughterhouses was shambles, and there are streets named ""The Shambles"" in some English and Irish towns (e.g., Worcester, York, Bandon) which got their name from having been the site on which butchers killed and prepared animals for consumption. Fishamble Street, Dublin was formerly a fish-shambles. Sheffield had 183 slaughterhouses in 1910, and it was estimated that there were 20,000 in England and Wales.', 'In some societies, traditional cultural and religious aversion to slaughter led to prejudice against the people involved. In Japan, where the ban on slaughter of livestock for food[specify] was lifted in the late 19th century, the newly found slaughter industry drew workers primarily from villages of burakumin, who traditionally worked in occupations relating to death (such as executioners and undertakers). In some parts of western Japan, prejudice faced by current and former residents of such areas (burakumin ""hamlet people"") is still a sensitive issue. Because of this, even the Japanese word for ""slaughter"" (屠殺 tosatsu) is deemed politically incorrect by some pressure groups as its inclusion of the kanji for ""kill"" (殺) supposedly portrays those who practice it in a negative manner.', 'In order for people to eat meat, animals have to be slaughtered, or killed, and the place where this happens on a large scale is a slaughterhouse. Sometimes it\'s also called an abattoir. The word stems from a Scandinavian root and is related to the Old Norseslatr, ""a butchering."" The word slaughterhouse can also refer to a violent situation. In Kurt Vonnegut\'s novel ""Slaughterhouse Five,"" war prisoners are housed in an abandoned slaughterhouse, which is also a metaphor for war itself.', ""People on the cut lines work with a mindless fury. There is tremendous pressure to keep the conveyor belts moving, to pack orders, to put bacon and ham and sausage on the public's breakfast table. There is no clock, no window, no fragment of the world outside. Everything is pork. If the line fails to keep pace, the kill men must slow down, backing up the slaughter. The boxing line will have little to do, costing the company payroll hours. The blacks who kill will become angry with the Mexicans who cut, who in turn will become angry with the white superintendents who push them."", 'The slaughterhouse emerged as a coherent institution in the 19th century. A combination of health and social concerns, exacerbated by the rapid urbanisation experienced during the Industrial Revolution, led social reformers to call for the isolation, sequester and regulation of animal slaughter. As well as the concerns raised regarding hygiene and disease, there were also criticisms of the practice on the grounds that the effect that killing had, both on the butchers and the observers, ""educate[d] the men in the practice of violence and cruelty, so that they seem to have no restraint on the use of it."" An additional motivation for eliminating private slaughter was to impose a careful system of regulation for the ""morally dangerous"" task of putting animals to death.[citation needed]']"
why do catholics worship the virgin Mary?,"Catholics worship the Virgin Mary because they believe that she is the most beautiful and lovely creation of God[1][2][4][5], who was chosen to be the mother of Jesus[2][4]. Catholics don't actually worship Mary, they honor her because she is the mother of Jesus[2]. Catholics believe that Mary was free from sin and was an Advocate of all graces, a Great Wonderworker, and the New Eve[4]. They also believe that they can ask Mary to intercede on their behalf before God in heaven[1][5], which is not considered a type of “sacrifice”, but a simple request between two creatures[5].","[""When asked why they worship Mary, Catholics will reply that through her they believe in one God, praising the marvelous creation that God has made. They regard Mary as God's most beautiful and lovely creation, and in worshipping her, they also praise God. For Catholics, this is comparable to applauding a sculptor or painter for his work. It is a dilemma because God forbids us to worship Him with anything we have created. Christians are instructed not to worship the form of anything, whether it is in heaven or on Earth."", 'First of all, Catholics do not worship Mary. We honor her because she is the mother of Jesus. God himself honored Mary, by finding her worthy to be the mother of His only son. God sent the angel Gabriel to Mary to tell her: ‘Hail, Mary, full of grace! The Lord is with you. Do not be afraid Mary, for you have found favor with God. Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus.’ Mary said ‘Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your word.’', 'At first glance, Catholics appear to be worshipers of the Virgin Mary when they kneel down before her statues and ask for her intercession. To the outsider, Catholics are disobeying the first of the 10 Commandments, “Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.”', 'Catholics believe that the Virgin Mary was free from sin, as was Jesus. Mary herself prayed to God, the Father in heaven. She is called the Queen of Heaven, Advocate of all graces, Great Wonderworker, Mother of all Christians, Mother of Mankind, Mother of the Church, and New Eve.', 'Catholics believe that adoration and worship are due to God alone. When Catholics pray to a specific saint, such as the Virgin Mary, they do so asking the saint to intercede for them on their behalf before the throne of God in heaven. The prayer is not meant to be a type of “sacrifice” directed to the saint, but a simple request made between two creatures.']"
Why are ants considered to be especially dangerous to other arthropods?,"Ants are considered especially dangerous to other arthropods because they are abundant generalist predators that can spread pathogens, increase the density of honeydew-producing pest species, reduce the abundance of other natural enemies and pollinators, and reduce pollination services, leading to fruit formation[1]. Additionally, some species of ants may carry and transmit bacterial and fungal organisms that are serious disease pathogens[5]. Furthermore, certain types of ants can pose a potential health risk[2]. Finally, ants have the potential to transfer pathogenic agents from contaminated matrices to food[4].","['Ants are considered as natural enemies of arthropods because they are abundant generalist predators [14–18]. As predators, ants perform services on crops such as reducing pest abundance and plant damage (e.g. lost leaf area, fruit and seed damage), leading to an increase in crop yield [18,19]. However, the role of ants in agriculture is not yet completely clear because they can also cause disservices . For example, ants can spread pathogens, increase the density of honeydew-producing pest species (e.g. mealybugs, soft scales, aphids, psyllids or whiteflies among others), and reduce the abundance of other natural enemies and pollinators [18,20]. For instance, pollinators are able to detect and avoid flowers if ants are present, decreasing pollination services and compromising fruit formation [21,22]. Therefore, it is essential to understand the net effects of ants on biological control.', 'Another danger you need to worry about is the potential health risk certain types of ants can cause.', 'Ants communicate and cooperate by using chemicals that can alert others to danger or lead them to a promising food source. They typically eat nectar, seeds, fungus, or insects. However, some species have diets that are more unusual. Army ants may prey on reptiles, birds, or even small mammals.', 'Taken together, this study highlights the significance of ants as systematic carriers of fungi, frequent carriers of coliforms and Bacillus spp., and sporadic carriers of Salmonella and L. monocytogenes. Moreover, this study demonstrated that ants have the potential to transfer pathogenic agents from contaminated matrices to food. This issue is further compounded by the general behavior of Mauritians towards ants, which varied from mild concern to total disregard leading the society to believe that there is no need for ant monitoring and control. In fact, most consumers approached in the study were not aware of any health implications associated with ant infestation of kitchens and exposed food, making them more vulnerable to foodborne illnesses. Since ants are prevalent in homes, particularly in food preparation and storage areas, concern about their impact on food quality and safety is certainly warranted.', 'While ants are not nearly as significant as mosquitoes and other medically important insects, they do carry and transmit bacterial and fungal organisms that are serious disease pathogens.']"
"If elephants are being slaughtered for their tusks, why don't reseves remove them without injuring the elephant so the poachers have nothing to slaughter for?","It is not possible to safely and humanely remove an elephant's tusks, as the tusk is part of the boney skull processes[1]. Removing the tusks from a large population of elephants would be a logistically impossible task, could cause a lot of distress to the animals and their families, and would likely result in a high number of deaths. Furthermore, although an absence of tusks might help protect elephants from poaching, tusklessness is not necessarily a positive thing[3]. Finally, some governments have adopted the policy of destroying seized illegal ivory instead of storing it, as it reduces the supply and eliminates the potential for the 'disappearance' of the stockpiles[5].","['Elephants tusk removal is also not possible as the tusk is part of the boney skull processes – hence the reason why poachers have to kill elephants to remove the tusks. To cut the tusks shorter would be a logistical task. However, although the stump is only 7-10% of the whole, this “small” bit of ivory still means big money on the black market.', 'Capturing, sedating and dying the tusks of as many as 400,000 elephants is logistically impossible; the disruption and distress caused to these elephants could be detrimental to individuals and families; the number of elephants killed in the process would likely be sizeable; and the process would have to be repeated every few years or so.', 'A lack of tusks might save elephants from ivory poachers but an increase in tusklessness is not necessarily positive', 'Interesting, that in the face of the Chinese led slaughter of African wildlife, killing their native elephants in Yunnan Province is a death penalty offense. Quote from a New York Time’s article April 25, 2014 “”Since 1995, when four people were executed by firing squad for killing an elephant, only a handful of domestic elephants have been poached for their tusks, according to the state news media, and not one in the past decade.', 'Once a Customs officer seizes elephant ivory tusks, there are different views on what action governments should take. Increasingly, many governments are opting for destruction of stockpiles through incineration or crushing rather than storage. Part of the rationale is that since the damage has already been done, it is best to reduce the supply. In addition, it negates the potential for the ‘disappearance’ of confiscated ivory stockpiles, which happens from time to time. Do you have a view on what governments should do with ivory seizures, and would you suggest that Customs administrations adopt a policy of destroying seized illegal ivory?']"
"If utilities infastructure was created through taxpayer dollars, then why do people have to pay private companies for their utilities?","People have to pay private companies for their utilities because utilities are “regulated monopolies” in which public officials guarantee the companies a monetary return on their investments while also fixing prices for consumers[1]. Partnerships with private financing can help state and local governments issue tax-exempt bonds for a water utility partnership, which is less expensive for state and local taxpayers than the increases in user fees and other costs associated with private financing[2]. Additionally, municipalities may be concerned that water and wastewater fees would increase as a result of a greater private-sector role and that, as a result, low-income households would find it difficult to purchase those services[3]. Furthermore, private water companies received an estimated $1.9 billion in 2018 dollars to design, build, operate, or maintain water utilities for municipalities and the federal government[4], and utilities earn profits on the investments in the assets that are used to provide the service, such as the pipes, substations, and transmission lines[1][5].","['Utilities do not operate in a normal free market system where prices and profits are determined by the willingness of consumers to pay. Instead, they are “regulated monopolies” in which public officials guarantee the companies a monetary return on their investments while also fixing prices for consumers. In practice, that means before a utility can earn money, it needs to convince regulators how much it should make. In public proceedings called “rate cases,” utilities appear before a dedicated state agency known as a utility commission (it’s the Utilities and Transportation Commission in Washington and the Public Utility Commission in Oregon) and lay out their argument for how much money they need to bring in to run their business and make a reasonable profit, namely the “revenue requirement.”', 'Partnerships With Private Financing. State and local governments have shown little interest in private financing because federal tax regulations allow a private entity to assume long-term responsibility for a water utility—including capital projects—without compromising the tax-exempt status of the municipal owner’s debt. As a result, state and local governments can issue tax-exempt bonds for a water utility partnership, which is less expensive for state and local taxpayers than the increases in user fees and other costs associated with private financing, without taking into consideration the costs of federal interest rate subsidies, risk, and transaction costs. Consequently, the values of design-build contracts for water utilities are much lower than those for transportation, especially water utility contracts with private financing (see Figure 1).', 'Control Over Fees. One reason water utilities do not partner with private companies more often is that municipalities want to control the pricing of water and wastewater services. Clean drinking water and sewerage are often viewed as basic goods that contribute broadly to public health and should be available to everyone. Municipalities may be concerned that water and wastewater fees would increase as a result of a greater private-sector role and that, as a result, low-income households would find it difficult to purchase those services. (Some contracts with the private sector have limited how much rates can change in the future.) Higher water and wastewater treatment fees were also a concern when utilities were fully privatized because state regulators allowed the private entity to increase rates—even when those rates incorporated a subsidy from general tax revenues.38', 'In 2016, private water companies received an estimated $1.9 billion (in 2018 dollars) to design, build, operate, or maintain water utilities for municipalities and the federal government (in particular, for combined water and wastewater systems on military bases). The bulk of those revenues came from contracts of eight or more years, long enough in CBO’s assessment to transfer a substantial amount of risk to the private partner and be considered here as public-private partnerships. Almost all those payments were for operating and maintaining water utilities, with less than $100 million coming from design-build services.', 'Utilities’ profit doesn’t come from the natural gas or water or electricity they provide to customers. That’s right, utilities do not earn profits on the products they sell—gas, water, and power are provided “at cost” to consumers—but rather from the investment in the assets (the pipes, substations, transmission lines, etc.) that are used to provide the service. In short, the more infrastructure that a utility builds, the higher the profits it can generate.']"
"With potentially millions of different species available, why has humanity only fully domesticated a small handful?","There are several reasons why humanity has only fully domesticated a small handful of species out of the potentially millions of species available. One reason is that only 14 large mammals have ever been domesticated because they were the only 14 to fulfill all four basic criteria for domestication[1]. Another reason is that the domestication of species has helped create our modern society by creating a world with stable food production, which enabled the human population to boom worldwide[2]. Additionally, the domestication of plants and animals represents a key turning point in human history and the development of agricultural economies based on domesticates is arguably the central factor in the loss of global biodiversity[3]. It is estimated that about 40 species around the world that directly or indirectly contribute to agriculture are domesticated, with several of these species having a distinct scientific name than their wild ancestors[4].

It fueled a population explosion of agro-pastoralists and has been a cornerstone of increasingly complex societies around the world.

At what point does a fertilized egg or an embryo gain consciousness or awareness that its alive?,"There is no consensus among scientists as to when a fertilized egg or an embryo gains consciousness or awareness that it is alive[1][3]. Some scientists believe it is at fertilization, where the zygote gets a new genome, where the sperm and egg combine, their nuclear materials[3].

Still others say it is at week 24 to 28 when you see the beginnings of the human specific electroencephalogram[3], or at birth or during the perinatal period where a successful birth is possible[3]. The embryonic stage reveals that the fertilized egg is a clump of cells with no brain, and the processes that begin to generate a nervous system do not begin until after the fourteenth day[4]. No sustainable or complex nervous system is in place until approximately six months of gestation[4].","[""The question is tricky because it implicitly involves the definition of consciousness, a red herring. If we define consciousness as awareness of one's own state, it will be much later. Even teenagers sometimes seem confused as to why they did or said this or that. (I guess some adults too.) However, a fetus in her third trimester will manifest left and right-hemisphere integration under an EEG, thus displaying the foundation for consciousness. Possibly, the major shock of being born, when the umbilical cord is cut and the baby is forced to breathe and to face a completely different environment, is what jolts the brain into consciousness. At this point the baby is obviously alive, kicking and crying."", ""The first one is that the instructions for development and heredity are all in the fertilized egg.

Some scientists will say it's at implantation, where you get a pregnancy. Other scientists will say it's at day 14, gastrulation, where the embryo becomes an individual, where you can no longer form twins and triplets, so that you have one embryo giving rise to, at best, only one adult. Some scientists will say it's at week 24 to 28 when you see the beginnings of the human specific electroencephalogram, and saying if we're willing to say that death is the loss of the EEG, perhaps personhood is the acquisition of the EEG.

How food or sleep can help relieve migraines,"Eating certain foods can help relieve migraine symptoms. Studies suggest that a low-fat, high-fiber plant-based diet may be beneficial for migraine relief.

"If our bodies are supposed to be able to run on fat reserves, why do we feel weak and are unable to think clearly when very hungry?","When we don't eat for a while and our body relies on fat reserves for energy, we may feel weak and unable to think clearly because our body first reaches out for sugar for energy, not fat.

Is it as dangerous for animals to eat raw meat as it is for us humans?,"Yes, it is as dangerous for animals to eat raw meat as it is for us humans. Eating raw meat increases the risk of a range of health problems for both humans and animals, and people at increased risk, such as children, pregnant or nursing women, and older adults, should avoid consuming raw meat altogether. Animals also can contract diseases or parasites from eating the flesh of other animals[2], and the risk becomes higher the longer the flesh has been rotting[1].","['The second assumption is that we, humans, cannot eat raw meat.

The major difference between us and a lion is that a lion tends to chow down immediately after the kill; only humans have taken to storing meat for long periods of time, applying the squirrel’s hoarding strategy to flesh.

First: Can animals eat raw meat without problems? The answer is no — plenty of animals contract diseases or, more commonly, parasites from eating the flesh of other animals.

"Why are some types of animals just naturally aggressive, while others are docile?","Aggression is a complex behavior that can be caused by a variety of factors. Genetics has been shown to play an important role in the development of aggression, as some animals are naturally more aggressive than others due to their genetic makeup. Pain-induced and irritable aggression can also be triggered by pain, frustration or deprivation, and can be directed toward people, animals and objects[2]. In pet cats, aggression can range from cats who hiss and avoid the target of their aggression to cats who attack[3]. Additionally, aggressive behavior can be reinforced by providing animals with repeated positive aggressive experiences, as this can increase their aggressiveness[4]. Lastly, the sudden and unpredictable omission of reinforcement just before a confrontation with an opponent can also enhance aggressive behavior in animals[5].","['Aggressive behavior is an ancient and conserved trait, habitual for most animals in order to eat, protect themselves, compete for mating and defend their territories. Genetic factors have been shown to play an important role in the development of aggression both in animals and humans, displaying moderate to high heritability estimates. Although such types of behaviors have been studied in different animal models, the molecular architecture of aggressiveness remains poorly understood. This study compared gene expression profiles of 16 prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples from aggressive and non-aggressive cattle breeds: Lidia, selected for agonistic responses, and Wagyu, selected for tameness.', 'Pain-induced and irritable aggression are triggered by pain, frustration or deprivation, and they can be directed toward people, animals and objects. Any animal—including humans—can aggress when in pain. So even a well-socialized, normally docile cat can lash out when he’s hurt, when someone tries to touch a painful part of him (for example, to medicate his infected ears), or when he’s in pain and he anticipates being handled because someone is approaching him. Cats with aggression problems should always be examined for underlying medical problems, especially painful diseases such as arthritis, dental pain and abscesses from fighting. Painful punishment is not only ineffective for changing cat behavior, it can also trigger pain-induced aggression and worsen other types of aggression, like fear and territorial aggression. Body postures will usually be defensive.', 'Aggression is threatening or harmful behavior directed toward a person, another cat or other animals. Virtually all wild animals display aggression to guard their territories, defend their offspring and protect themselves if attacked. Aggression refers to a wide variety of complex behaviors that occur for different reasons under various circumstances. In pet cats, aggressive behavior can range from cats who hiss and avoid the target of their aggression to cats who attack.', 'Similarly, animals are motivated to perform an operant (nose-poke or lever-press response) where the opportunity to get access to an opponent and display aggressive behavior serves as the reinforcer (Miczek et al., 2002). This indicates that, even though aggressive confrontations may be extremely stressful or anxiogenic, the performance of aggression can function as a potent positive reinforcing event (Miczek et al., 2002, 2004; Couppis and Kennedy, 2008). Providing an animal with repeated positive (i.e., winning) aggressive experiences in its home cage generally leads to an increase in aggressiveness (Kudryatseva, 2000; Kudryatseva et al., 2000). After extended repeated winning experiences, certain individuals may start to attack with very short latency, high intensity and high frequency and without regard to signals of submission, often leading to severe wounding of the opponent (Hsu et al., 2006).', 'The sudden and unpredictable omission of reinforcement just before confrontation with an opponent enhances aggressive behavior in animals. One of the first studies was carried out by Pavlov (1927), who conditioned dogs to associate the arrival/withholding of food with a specific geometrical shape. However, when the different shapes presented were manipulated to look alike, the subject became confused and eventually aggressive, apparently out of frustration. A resident animal can also be provoked by placing an instigator or opponent into its home cage behind a protective screen for a short time prior to the actual physical confrontation. This is known to accelerate and/or enhance aggressive attacks. This so-called social instigation/provocation or priming procedure has been successfully demonstrated in mice (Fish et al., 1999), rats (Potegal, 1992) and hamsters (Potegal et al., 1993).']"

"How come so few species feel ""good"" when having sexual actions and why/how did it develop (in humans)?","The development of feeling good during sexual actions in humans likely developed as an evolutionary function. It is thought that orgasm serves as a secondary reinforcer linking sexual behaviors and partner affiliation, which could have been a way for women to choose good mates[2]. Additionally, cues of courtship and reproduction that were consistently associated with higher reproductive success recurrently throughout evolutionary history likely became primary reinforcers[3]. This could explain why humans, like other vertebrates, have internal fertilization and an external male penetrating organ and an internal female reception area[5]. All of these features would increase the likelihood of successful reproduction and could be reinforced through the release of pleasure-inducing hormones.","['And no matter which partner is on top, face-to-face positions occur much more frequently than otherwise in acts of human copulation (according to the discussion and drawings in biologist Alan Dixson’s Sexual Selection and the Origins of Human Mating Systems). So although we are an objectively and exceptionally adventurous species when it comes to sex and seeking its pleasures, we also have our typical behaviors—like all species do. And our typical procreative positions do not include an “inverted 69.”', 'If evolution designed a woman to have sex with a man for his superior genetic complement or a man to have sex in order to conceive offspring, they need not be motivated to engage in sex longer than is needed for fertilization and certainly would not be motivated to engage in non-reproductive sex. Indeed, for many researchers, bonding is seen as the primary function of female orgasm; ‘orgasm serves as a secondary reinforcer linking sexual behaviors and partner affiliation’ (Prause, 2011). However, others see sire choice as its primary mechanism (Puts, Dawood, & Welling, 2012). In practice, because the characteristics of good genes, good mates, and good social partners often overlap (e.g. strength, empathy, health), it is often difficult to disentangle these influences.', ""Consider evolution as an agent that calibrates the subjective pleasure of behavior based on how adaptive it is for the organism. It's no wonder that finding and consuming food and sex are primary reinforcers as they facilitate survival and reproduction. However, considering sex as reinforcing can be taken one step further. According to an adaptationist account of conditioning, any cues of courtship or reproduction that are consistently associated with higher reproductive success recurrently throughout evolutionary history can become a primary reinforcer. This can include practicing courtship skills (e.g. telling stories), the attention one gets from potential mates (e.g. eye contact, smiling), initiating sexual behavior (e.g. intimate touch, kissing) all the way up to penetration, orgasm, and seeing one's partner indicating intense pleasure and orgasm."", 'There are multiple answers to the question of where we come from: early hominins, monkeys, primordial goo, or the Big Bang, to name a few. Today’s answer, though, has probably, just a split second ago, popped into many readers’ minds. Today’s answer is sexual intercourse, a.k.a. “bleeping.” So let’s go back to the beginning, hundreds of millions of years before we invented euphemisms and censorship, and let’s ask: How in the evolutionary world did sex begin?', 'But after the origins of sex, it took another 1.5 billion years for sexual intercourse—as we vertebrates know it—to come about. I’m talking about the kind of reproductive sex that humans and other mammals, as well as some birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, have—with an external male penetrating organ and an internal female reception area. In other words, I’m talking about bleeping. With internal fertilization, unlike with moss sex and flower sex, weather and middlemen are irrelevant (but they can still play a role—for humans anyway). The seemingly more dependable but deceptively complex process of internal fertilization is nearly 400 million years old among vertebrates.']"
What are the effects of Austerity and why does Germany allegedly profit from this policy?,"Austerity is a policy of restraining government spending and taxation in order to reduce a budget deficit[1][4]. In the early 1930s, austerity measures in Germany worsened social suffering, contributed to political unrest, and led to the rise of the Nazi Party[2][3][5]. Germany allegedly profits from austerity by refusing to correct trade imbalances and growing at the expense of other EMU participants, which have to go through painful internal devaluations and fiscal austerity[4]. The demise of Weimar Germany and the rise of Nazi fascism reveals that too much harsh austerity can trigger social unrest and unintended political consequences[3][5].","['Let’s start with the criticism. People concerned with wage policy argue that Germany has undergone a substantial internal devaluation of its real unit labour costs: real wages have fallen behind productivity rates in both the private and public sector, thus yielding a cost and price competitiveness premium to the German export sector. Those who point at fiscal policy stress the German budget surplus, bemoaning the lack of government spending. Deflationary wage policies are said to deter household consumption at home and imports from abroad. An austere fiscal policy contains the government’s final consumption and contributes to keeping imports artificially low. At any rate, the combination of a restrictive wage and fiscal stance represses total domestic demand (public and private), leads to relatively low inflation, real exchange rates competitiveness and trade surpluses – which prevent the possibility of other EMU participants adjusting via an export-led recovery.', 'We also study the impact of austerity on Nazi electoral gains in relation to different types of expenditure. Here we find that most of the electoral impact of austerity was driven by cuts to social spending on health and housing, two of the budget lines severely affected by austerity. These cuts in social spending plausibly exacerbated the suffering of many Germans. Indeed, we find that the localities experiencing relatively severe austerity experienced relatively high suffering (measured by mortality rates) and electorates in these areas with higher mortality were often more likely to vote for the Nazi Party. This is in line with the views of commentators at the time. For instance, by the fall of October 1930, Hjalmar Schacht (former head of the Reichsbank) gave an interview to the American press warning that “if the German people are going to starve, there are going to be many more Hitlers” (The New York Times, 3 October 1930).', 'Many Western countries pursued deep austerity measures in response to debts from the financial crisis of 2007-2008, and may again do so in the wake of COVID-19 stimulus packages. This column reviews how in the early 1930s, austerity measures worsened social suffering and contributed to political unrest paving the way for the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany. The authors argue that the absence of a coherent response to social suffering from the Weimar government worsened the slump, contributing to the radicalisation and polarisation of the German electorate.', 'German policy makers, the argument goes, should rein in the country’s trade surplus and allow for symmetric adjustments in the EMU. Germany is accused of engineering economic growth at home by free-riding on other European countries’ aggregate demand. Some even go as far as to argue that Germany is “artificially” and “purposefully” repressing domestic household consumption, government spending and private investments to sustain a mercantilist model. Germany allegedly refuses to correct trade imbalances and – given fixed exchange rates – grows at the expense of other EMU participants, which have to go through painful internal devaluations and fiscal austerity. What is thus being asked of Germany is to reduce its trade and budget surpluses to provide a more symmetric adjustment mechanism to the single currency via the expansion of its domestic demand for EMU exports.', 'The demise of Weimar Germany and the rise of Nazi fascism reveals that too much harsh austerity can trigger social unrest and unintended political consequences. Even after correcting for alternative explanations, including the economic downturn, it is clear austerity played a critical role. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that austerity led to substantial human suffering and exacerbated inequality and inequity. At a time when people needed the most from their government, the government failed them, and they were lured by the siren calls of radical populist parties.']"
Why does white bread crisp quicker compared to brown bread when toasted?,"White bread crisps quicker compared to brown bread when toasted because it contains more starch than whole wheat bread[1][4]. This means that the body metabolizes white bread faster than whole wheat bread and can spike blood sugar levels, which can be harmful for people with diabetes or a risk of diabetes[4]. In contrast, brown bread is healthier and more nutritious than white bread[1][2][3][4][5], and is a better option for adults and people focusing on losing weight[2][3][5].","['Considering the nutritional value, whole wheat bread is a better option than white bread. One of the ways to recognize whole wheat bread from white is the color. However, there may be instances when white bread may have added caramel coloring to give it a brown look. This is the reason why it is advisable to make whole wheat bread at home. With the help of KENT Atta and Bread Maker, you can easily bake fresh, soft, and aromatic brown bread right at home.', 'Off Late people are switching to brown bread and giving up the consumption of white one. The more nutrition in brown bread is attracting the people towards it and opting for brown bread instead of the white one. Multigrain bread is also a great option when it comes to choosing between white bread and brown bread as it is better than brown bread too but a little less tastier as it is composed of different types of edible grains. The brown bread proves itself superior in terms of health and nutrition in comparison to the white one in many aspects therefore in most cases brown bread should be chosen. White bread can also be eaten in moderation by healthy and young people who are on a regular balanced diet and exercise.', 'CONCLUSION - Brown bread is definitely healthier and more fulfilling in terms of nutrition and calories. The nutritional values of brown bread suit adults and people focusing on losing weight. However white bread can be consumed by young people.', 'White bread contains more starch than whole wheat bread. This is the reason why the body metabolizes white bread quickly as compared to whole wheat bread. In short, your body converts white bread into sugar at a faster rate and spikes your blood sugar level. This can be very harmful to people who suffer from diabetes or have the chance of getting diabetes. Not just white bread, but any food that spikes the blood sugar level can lead to inflammation and spike blood sugar levels.', 'Bread is an important part of our breakfast routine. Starting from crispy toast, and stuffed sandwiches to break pakoda, there is a lot you can make with bread. Gone are the days when white bread was the only option available. With a number of options such as atta bread or whole wheat bread available on the shelves of the stores, picking something that is healthy and tasty is difficult. Among the different variants of bread available, wheat bread has gained a lot of popularity. However, a question that many people have in their minds is whether wheat bread is better than the age-old white bread. Read on to find out.']"
Why do stimulants cause some people with ADHD to feel drowsy?,"Stimulants like Adderall can cause some people with ADHD to feel drowsy because of the way it interacts with the dopamine levels in their body. People with ADHD may not feel the sense of reward or accomplishment after completing a task that neurotypical people do, which can make it hard to persist with challenging tasks and cause them to seem sleepy or disinterested. Stimulants can also cause sleep deprivation, leading to mood issues and an ""Adderall crash"" when the medication wears off[4]. Furthermore, ADHD is linked to symptoms such as increased sleep latency, daytime somnolence, and reduced REM sleep[5], which can be improved through the use of stimulants like methylphenidate.","['For some kids, difficulty falling asleep is truly a side effect of stimulant medication. But other kids are kept awake at night by a lack of medication. That is, once the last dose of the day wears off, these children return to “being” ADHD. They feel restless, hear every sound, and find it impossible to “turn off” their brain.', 'Some people with ADHD have a paradoxical or reverse response to stimulant medications. Instead of being further revved up, the stimulant medications shut off the mental and physical restlessness caused by ADHD and allow normal sleep. Many ADHD clinicians suggest a trial after the optimal dose of medication by asking the patient to nap about 30 minutes later. People with ADHD who cannot normally nap during the day may find that stimulant medication turns off the chatter in their heads and allows them to fall asleep. For these patients, it is clear that the ADHD medication helps with ADHD-based sleep problems rather than making sleep more difficult. The person may still have difficulty with sleep, but the cause is not the stimulant medication.', '- Reward deficiency: Dopamine helps neurotypical people feel a sense of reward or accomplishment after completing a task. People with ADHD may not feel this sense of reward. This can make it hard to persist with challenging tasks and may cause a person to seem sleepy or disinterested even after an important accomplishment.', 'Stimulants like Adderall are often prescribed to people with ADHD to help them concentrate better on home, work or school tasks. However, when Adderall results in sleep deprivation, it can have opposite effects on productivity, leading to a lack of focus and mood issues in many. In fact, when the medication begins to wear off, people can experience what is often referred to as an “Adderall crash,” resulting in irritability and insomnia.', 'Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is linked to symptoms such as increased sleep latency and daytime somnolence and reduced REM sleep. Adult patients may benefit from the use of central nervous stimulants such as methylphenidate to aid sleep. Sleep is a significant issue for many adults with ADHD, and poor sleep habits can worsen daytime symptoms and create a vicious cycle.']"
"If two different species can't breed with each other, how do we have things like the liger? (Lion + Tiger","Ligers are possible because of a process known as introgression, which occurs when one species contains some of the genes of another species[2]. Ligers are a hybrid between a lion and tiger, and have 50% of their genes from the lion and 50% from the tiger[1][2][5]. Backcrossing, when hybrids mate with either of their parent species, also helps to maintain the percentage of lion genes, even if it decreases over time[2]. It was also discovered in 1943 that ligers can successfully mate with a lion, producing offspring[4]. Additionally, it is thought that ligers are healthier than purebred animals due to the varied gene pool[4]. Ligers are also distinct from a similar hybrid called the tigon, as they typically grow larger than either parent species[5].","['- This lion-tiger hybrid has 50% of its genes from the lion and 50% from the tiger. If the hybrid then mates with a tiger (bottom left), that offspring, called a backcrossed hybrid, will have lower percentage of lion genes. (A) Is a cartoon, and in reality, ligers, and tigons are mixed all over their bodies as we see in (B). Which is an example of two ligers living in a zoo.', 'When hybrids mate with either of their parent species, their offspring are known as backcrossed hybrids . In Figures 2A,B, we see a liger, a hybrid between a lion and tiger that has mated with a tiger. The baby from this mix, the backcrossed hybrid, still has some lion genes. If backcrossing continues for many generations (the backcrossed hybrid mates with a tiger, then its offspring does the same) the percentage of lion genes will get smaller and smaller, but they are not lost completely. This means that lion genes can eventually become part of the tiger species’ gene pool. When one species contains some of the genes of another species, it is known as introgression. This is a powerful evolutionary force, because these new genes may code for new traits or behaviors that could help the parent species .', 'Ligers and tigons were long thought to be totally sterile. However, in 1943, a fifteen-year-old hybrid between a lion and an island tiger was successfully mated with a lion at the Munich Hellabrunn Zoo. The female cub, though of delicate health, was raised to adulthood.', ""While I am oppose to the commercial breeding of this animal or any animal for the sole purpose of sport/entertainment, I find this article questionable despite the good intentions. The liger is a hybrid that is NOT born sterile which is highly unusual for hybrid species produced in captivity which leads many scientists to believe that there was a possibility at one time long ago when geography and man was not an obstacle for these animals to breed. It isn't uncommon in evolutionary cycles for animals of subspecies to breed for survival. It should also be noted that hybrids…mutts in general tend to be HEALTHIER because of the varied gene pool. Just look at purebred dogs and cats and the genetic health risks that come along with many of the breeds. As for the existing ligers, they should definitely be protected by law. But seeing the near extinction of both tiger and lion species in the future, perhaps we can learn something from ligers after all."", 'The liger is a hybrid offspring of a male lion (Panthera leo) and a female tiger (Panthera tigris). The liger has parents in the same genus but of different species. The liger is distinct from the similar hybrid called the tigon, and is the largest of all known extant felines. They enjoy swimming, which is a characteristic of tigers, and are very sociable like lions. Notably, ligers typically grow larger than either parent species, unlike tigons.']"
"why are birds and butterflies so brightly colored and patterned, with blues and greens and reds, but not any mammals?","Birds and butterflies are brightly colored and patterned because of co-evolution with their pollinators[1]. They have adapted specific shapes and colors to attract their pollinators, such as red flowers for butterflies and pink, yellow, blue, and distinctly marked flowers for bees[1]. The colors of butterflies also serve as a defensive signaling[2][3]. The colors of animals are determined by pigment groups, such as melanin, hemoglobin, carotenoids, guanine, and ingested pigments[5]. Blues and greens are rare in animals, as there is no blue or green pigment, and are caused by the interaction of light waves, which is why they are found in iridescent colors[5]. Mammals, however, are covered in hair to protect them from the sun’s ultraviolet radiation, which does not allow for the display of iridescent colors[5].","['Our beloved wildflowers have attained their color because they have co-evolved with their pollinators by adapting specific shapes and displaying certain colors that attracts them to their blooming flower. For example, butterflies prefer red flowers that have a platform for landing. “Bees are attracted to pink, yellow, blue, and distinctly marked flowers, many of which reflect ultraviolet light, sometimes in a bull’s-eye pattern . . .” (Williams, E.H. 2005. Pg 2) Flies, which have poorer vision, prefer saucer-shaped white flowers. “Night feeding moths are attracted to heavy fragrance, but because colors are not visible at night, moth-pollinated flowers are usually pale green or white.” (Williams, E.H. 2005. Pg 2) Bats choose large, pale, and fragrant flowers while beetles go for brightly colored flowers usually with an unpleasant or carrion scented fragrance. “Hummingbirds often choose red, tubular, hanging flowers with abundant nectar.” (Williams, E.H. 2005. Pg 2)', 'Butterflies are some of the most colorful animals on the planet. The diversity of their wing colors and patterns has not only inspired human artistic expression but it has also made these animals prominent study systems in biology. For example, butterflies have become leading model animals for the study of evolution and development, particularly of how wings are patterned. Equally, our understanding of defensive signaling is based largely on butterflies, for example, mimicry in Heliconius species where two butterflies unpalatable to predators resemble one another in color and pattern. Butterflies also play an important ecologic and economic role by pollinating flowers and orchard crops, where they utilize vision among other senses to find sources of nectar. Understanding vision in butterflies therefore gives us a fascinating insight into how these animals might see their surroundings, their own wing colors, and may also inform us on their patterns of habitat use and pollination.', 'While the role of some pigments are obvious, such as the green of chlorophyll, other colors play different roles in nature. While taking in the glory of a meadow in summer, vibrating with colors from wildflowers, butterflies, and other living organisms, keep in mind that in many cases, colors are “. . .signals, colorful communications from one organism to the other.” (Murphy, P. and Doherty, P. 1996. Pg 20) The flash of yellow from a flitting orange sulfur butterfly, the iridescent blue from a beetle’s wing, that flash of red from a red winged blackbird, and the pink and white stripe from hedge bindweed are all sending signals to each other in one of the most basic of means. Survival has no room for extra and, especially with living organisms, wastes no energy on superfluous displays; all fulfills a vital function.', 'The colorful wing patterns of butterflies, a prime example of biodiversity, can change dramatically within closely related species. Wing pattern diversity is specifically present among papilionid butterflies. Whether a correlation between color and the evolution of these butterflies exists so far remained unsolved.', 'Most mammals are covered in hair to protect them from the sun’s ultraviolet radiation. Color in animals is determined by pigment groups. Melanin produces browns and blacks. It is the most abundant surface pigment of animals and so creates a high frequency of dark coloration. Hemoglobin produces reds and carotenoids produce yellow, oranges, reddish orange, and pink. Guanine produce whites. Blues and greens are rare in animals, since there is no blue or green pigment, are caused by the interaction of light waves, especially in iridescent colors. Just a few animals, such as the pink of salmon and flamingoes, gain their coloration from the foods they eat. This is known as ingested pigments. (Williams, E.H. 2005. Pg 64) Flamingos gain their pink color from carotenoids found in shrimp. Should shrimp be removed from their diet, they would turn white. (Murphy, P. and Doherty, P. 1996. Pg 36)']"

The study was conducted in collaboration with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), an Australian federal research agency.', 'We first analyzed this problem in a 2019 study, the first such research that was conducted in cattle rather than in a laboratory. In that work, we showed that supplementing dairy cows’ feed with about 10 ounces of seaweed a day reduced methane emissions by up to 67%. However, the cattle that ate this relatively large quantity of seaweed consumed less feed. This reduced their milk production – a clear drawback for dairy farmers.', ""Kebreab said the methane emissions could be lowered even more by increasing the seaweed concentration used from about 1 percent to 2 percent of the cow's diet.""]"
How do such large objects get lodged so deeply in the noses of sea turtles?,"It is believed that the objects, such as plastic forks and straws, get lodged so deeply in the noses of sea turtles because the passageways for food and air are connected in a turtle just like they are in people[3]. It is possible that the object was initially ingested orally, but it was regurgitated and passed through the nasal cavity instead of the mouth[3]. Another possibility is that when the turtle was rummaging through the seafloor looking for food, it could have impaled itself on the straw[5].","['There has been two recent events related to objects stuck in the nostrils of sea turtles which are the product of accumulating plastic debris in the ocean, specifically in the waters of northwest Costa Rica.', 'The researchers saw an object protruding from the nostril of a olive ridley sea turtle as they were collecting epibionts from nesting turtles. They firmly gripped on the protruding end of the object with a Swiss Army knife and after a short pull, the object came free from the turtle’s nose and it became clear that the foreign body was a plastic fork.', 'The researchers believe that instead of the straw being driven into the sea turtles nose from the outside, it was initially ingested orally but was later regurgitated. The passageways for food and air are connected in a turtle just like they are in people. When the straw was regurgitated it did not pass out the mouth but passed through the nasal cavity. The nasal cavity in sea turtles is linked directly to the buccal cavity through a long nasopharyngeal duct (Wyneken 2001).', ""She's been campaigning against plastic straws for years, but never expected to find one lodged up a sea turtle's nose.

Why have humans evolved to need omega fats from fish if not all previous civilizations had access to fish?,"Humans have evolved to need omega fats from fish because these essential fatty acids are necessary for human neurological development[4], and consumption of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in correct proportion is necessary for intellectual, cognitive and social skills development in humans[3][4]. Early humans instinctively pursued the highly unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids found in greater amounts in animal organ meats and marine life[4]. In addition, over time, good fats have been stricken from our diets and replaced with seed oils, which are a source of omega-6 fatty acids[5]. This has caused an imbalance in the ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s, which is necessary for our bodies to fight inflammation.[5]","['During prehistoric evolution, hominins obtained the essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), omega-6 and omega-3 by consuming fruit, vegetables, seeds and nuts, and animal organ meats including marine life respectively. Twentieth-century findings indicated that the essential fatty acids contained in such foods were necessary for human neurological development  .', 'Some fascinating theories have traced the development of our brains to early humans who lived near water sources and so began to eat more fish and marine animals, which are rich sources of omega 3 fatty acids.', 'Consumption of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in correct proportion is necessary for intellectual, cognitive and social skills development in homo-sapiens  . Findings of two large studies (Sydney Diet Heart Study (1966-1973) and Minnesota Coronary Experiment (1968-1973) indicated that replacement of naturally evolved dietary saturated fats with oils rich in linoleic acid (omega-6 fatty acid) increased the chance of mortality from', 'We established firstly that early humans instinctively pursued the very highly unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids found in greater amounts in animal organ meats and marine life. Consuming vegetables and fruit gave them alternative access to the more abundant polyunsaturated class of essential fatty acids that had higher omega-6 content. Early hominins were omnivorous and able to simultaneously utilize the neurological and endocrinal advantages, by accessing the highly volatile omega-3 essential fatty acids primarily from animal and marine sources. These identifiable essential fatty acids were a necessary component of human physical, cerebral and ocular/visual development.', 'Our animal fats were once derived from leafy greens, and now our livestock are fattened with corn, soybeans, and other seed oils. (Even the majority of the salmon, catfish, and shrimp in our supermarkets are raised on farms and fattened with soy-enriched pellets.) So not only have good fats been stricken from our diets, but these cheap, widely available seed oils are the source of another, far less healthy family of fatty acids called omega-6s, which compete with omega-3s for space in our cell membranes. Omega-6s are essentially more rigid fatty acids that give our cells structure, while omega-3s are more fluid and help our bodies fight inflammation. Our ancestors ate a ratio of dietary omega-6s to omega-3s of approximately 1:1. The Western diet (the modern American and European eating pattern characterized by high intakes of red meat, sugar, and refined carbohydrates) has a ratio of about 20:1.']"
"What’s the difference between good sugars (ie. fruit) and bad for you sugars (candy, soda, etc.)?","The main difference between good sugars (fruit) and bad for you sugars (candy, soda, etc.) is that the sugars in fruit are packed less densely than in a candy bar and generally cause a lower spike in blood sugar levels than sweets[1]. Fruits also contain vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants, whereas processed or refined sugars do not have any significant nutritional value[4]. Additionally, fruit juice can lead to a spike in blood sugars in a similar fashion as soda or other sweetened beverages due to the lack of fiber[5].","['There are lots of kinds of sugar. Fruits have fructose, glucose and a combination of the two called ""sucrose,"" or ""table sugar."" But the sugars in fruit are packed less densely than in a candy bar, according to Elvira Isganaitis, a pediatric endocrinologist at Joslin Diabetes Center and a Harvard Medical School instructor. This difference is important for people with diabetes, a disorder which interferes with regulating sugar in the blood. When people eat something sweet, they usually have a spike in blood sugar levels. Then the spike plateaus and the amount of sugar in the blood eventually drops back to normal. Fruits generally cause a lower spike than sweets, Isganaitis says, making it less dangerous for people with diabetes monitoring their sugar levels.', 'But even for people without diabetes, sugar in fruit is a healthier option than sugar from other sources, according to nutritionist Wright. A can of soda, for example, has about 40 grams of sugar. ""And what else are you getting with that?"" Wright asks. ""You\'re getting no protein, no minerals and no fiber. You get nothing but the sugar and the calories.""', 'So, what’s the difference between fruit sugar and other sugars? “Refined, or processed, sugars come under many names, including white sugar, brown sugar, cane sugar, coconut sugar, palm sugar, invert sugar, high-fructose corn syrup—the list goes on!” Fleming says. “These sugars come from mainly plants but have been processed in some way to a simple, sweet form.”', 'Though refined sugar may be devilishly addictive, Fleming says it lacks any significant nutritional value—unlike fruit sugar. Fruits have vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants. In other words, the fruit you eat is more nutritious than a bag of candy.

Yes, fruit juice is still more nutritious than soda pop because of the antioxidants and vitamins, but in the end, it is essentially sugar water.']"
Jazz has a long history of contrafact. How does copyright law handle this?,"According to copyright law, contrafacts are protected under copyright because they are compositions that juxtapose original melodies over existing harmonic structures. However, improvisation, which represents the bulk of creative expression in jazz, remains unprotected by copyright[2]. To improve the standing of jazz musicians in copyright law, some arts attorneys have suggested alternatives such as redefining the scope of copyright law to include improvisation[5].","['However, the contrafact is not an exclusively jazz phenomenon, the tradition of taking an existing song and altering it started in the 16th century. During this time the lyrics for secular songs were often replaced with religious text. In doing so the harmonic backdrop was preserved while a more “meaningful” text was applied.', 'In the 1940s, Black musicians developed a new jazz style called “bebop”. With its complex harmonies and rhythms, bebop “transformed jazz into a modern art form” and firmly grounded it in improvisation. However, this music was not protected under copyright because it was not written down nor precomposed. Contrafacts are jazz songs characteristic of the bebop style that juxtapose original melodies over existing harmonic structures. These compositions allowed musicians to improvise melodies over popular songs, creating new works that attracted copyright protection. This reflects the fact that under copyright law, melody is most readily recognized as protected expression. Contrafacts sidestepped the need to obtain licences and streamed royalties back to jazz musicians. In this way, bebop musicians created new property rights while developing an innovative style through improvisation. To stretch Professor Parker’s earlier remark, bebop musicians created their own “rules” around copyright.', 'Improvisation represents the bulk of creative expression in jazz but remains unprotected by copyright. And yet, contrafacts show that altering one variable (melody) fundamentally shifts property rights allocation. This highlights the malleable nature of intellectual property – invoking what Story J called the metaphysics of law. Whereas traditional property rights tend to preserve the socio-economic status quo, intellectual property rights provide more egalitarian entry points insofar as such rights are constrained only by human imagination. But of course, that is only partially true; the law must recognize value in that expression. Canadian copyright law does not recognize jazz improvisation as a valuable property interest, instead, perpetuating traditional notions of composition through the dominant paradigm of pre-existing works. This flows in part from a limited understanding of jazz improvisation.', ""The whole point of a contrafact is to avoid copyright and royalty concerns. A chord progression can't be copywritten."", 'So, are there any alternatives that can improve the standing of jazz musicians in copyright law? The world of copyright law is awash in legalese. I’ve tried to write in clear language, but I need to trot out some of that legalese to show there are a couple of alternatives being pursued by arts attorneys.']"
Why can the same numeric temperature feel different at different times?,"The same numeric temperature can feel different at different times because of several factors. One is that reactions to the same weather conditions are all relative based on a person's location and related cultural norms[1]. Another reason is that our bodies get used to feeling a certain way and the process of acclimatization[3]. Also, temperature doesn't tell the whole story of human experience, and factors such as humidity, air speed and direction, how hot it usually is compared to right now, and even how much the air cooled during the previous night, all play a role in determining whether a temperature feels comfortable or crushing[4]. Additionally, the heat index is used in the US to measure the difference between real and perceived temperature and account for the effect of humidity on how a temperature feels[4][5].","['FiveThirtyEight published an interesting article (“Why The Same Temperature Can Feel Different Somewhere Else”) discussing how reactions to the same weather conditions are all “relative” based on a person’s location and related cultural norms.', 'In summer, I feel comfortably warm when the thermometer in my living room reads 20°C. Yet in winter, I feel cold at the same temperature. What causes this?', 'MEMPHIS, Tenn.

This process is called acclimatize.', 'Most of the time, when you check the daily weather report, you’re looking at the air temperature — a measurement of heat in the air around you. But that measurement doesn’t tell the whole story of human experience. What you feel like when you open the door — and how the situation you find outside affects your body — depends on more than temperature, said Margaret Sugg, a professor of geography and planning at Appalachian State University. Humidity, air speed and direction, how hot it usually is compared to right now, and even how much the air cooled during the previous night: These factors all play a role in determining whether 88 degrees Fahrenheit feels comfortable or crushing. How we talk about our thermal comfort is both cultural and scientific.', 'For example, we use the heat index in the United States to measure the difference between real and perceived temperature. This is a formula that combines air temperature and humidity to give people a better indication of when they might be at risk of heat stroke. The heat index tells us that 88 degrees with 40 percent humidity feels like 88 degrees, and while there is risk there if you’re out in the sun being active for a long time, it’s not a huge deal. In contrast, 88 degrees with 90 percent humidity feels like 113 degrees — cramps and exhaustion are likely, and activity could put you on the path to heat stroke.']"
Why are students considered more liberal than their contemporaries (both in modern and historical times)?,"Students are often considered more liberal than their contemporaries because of the liberal education they receive in college. A liberal education reflects and reinforces a modern, liberal, and enlightened sensibility, and it serves to promote democracy based on equality in freedom[1]. This education is also well-equipped to resist the descent into didactic or dogmatic education[1]. Additionally, surveys have found that even when conservative students rank a predominantly liberal institution highly in terms of being open to speech, they find themselves self-censoring[2]. Furthermore, universities that purport to provide a liberal education will be failing in their mission unless their graduates, progressives and conservatives alike, prove capable of sympathetically understanding the positions of the political party to which they do not belong and discerning what is true and enduring in the beliefs of their partisan opponents[3]. Moreover, surveys have found that more than half of students often feel intimidated by their peers on campus[4], and this is even more pronounced among conservative students[4]. Lastly, liberal education requires professors to maintain an open and flexible mind, and to favor the great liberal and Enlightenment aspiration to articulate universal principles of right conduct[5], which could be seen as taking the side of moderns against the ancients, of reason against faith, and of liberalism and Enlightenment against romantic and conservative critics[5].","['In fact, tensions inherent in liberal education do present a stiff challenge for educators. A liberal education reflects and reinforces a modern, liberal, and enlightened sensibility, and it does serve democracy based on equality in freedom. Faculty, Mill suggests, should be self-aware and candid about these presuppositions of the education they provide. At the same time, liberal education as he conceives it is particularly well-equipped to resist the descent into didactic or dogmatic education provided that it heeds its own imperatives to appreciate what modernity owes tradition, the knowledge of diversity and common humanity acquired through study of the classics, and the dependence of freedom on studying the history of rival and incompatible teachings on ethics, politics, and religion.', 'One of the most interesting findings in terms of political bias in the FIRE report comes from comparing conservative student ratings of institutions with liberal student ratings. What emerged is that even when conservatives rank a predominantly liberal institution highly in terms of being open to speech, they find themselves self-censoring. University of Chicago was ranked highly by both Liberals (1st) and Conservatives (3rd). Overall less than half of the students report self-censoring (44%). But when broken down by political leaning 82% of Conservatives report holding back their views compared to 53% of Moderates and 40% of Liberals. As one student at Chicago noted: “[I am] afraid to disagree with certain liberal talking points because even if I do not agree with the conservative side either I feel like I will be rejected for not being ‘woke’ enough.”', 'This suggests a test to determine whether the education a university provides is liberal in the large sense. It is to be expected, and indeed welcomed, given differences in background, talents, and tastes, that some students will, on reflection, become progressives and some conservatives. But universities that purport to provide a liberal education will be failing in their mission unless their graduates, progressives and conservatives alike, prove capable of sympathetically understanding the positions of the political party to which they do not belong and discerning what is true and enduring in the beliefs of their partisan opponents.', 'Over the last few years there have been a number of surveys to assess bias and willingness to share views on controversial issues among the student population. In 2018, the Buckley Program at Yale surveyed a national sample of 800 undergraduates and found that more than half (54%) reported they “often” felt intimidated by their peers on campus.” Breaking this down further, 62% of those students who identified as conservative “often” felt silenced. Given the progressive impulses on campuses this much may be expected. However, 53% of both moderate and liberal students also reported feeling uncomfortable sharing their ideas.', 'But then liberal education requires professors both to maintain an open and flexible mind and to favor the great liberal and Enlightenment aspiration to articulate universal principles of right conduct. Does it not thereby take the side of the moderns against the ancients, of reason against faith, of liberalism and Enlightenment against romantic and conservative critics? And is this not a contradiction or an invitation to hypocrisy?']"

How is it determined whether an animal is red meat or not?,"The amount of myoglobin found in the animal's muscle determines whether it is considered red meat or not[1][3][4].

Why vegetables and fruits seem to go bad faster than they used to years ago?,"Fruits and vegetables seem to go bad faster than they used to years ago because of declining nutrient levels[1-3]. Studies have shown that many fruits, vegetables, and grains grown today carry less protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron, riboflavin, and vitamin C than those that were grown decades ago[1]. This means that people may not be getting the nutrients they’re counting on from plant-based foods[3], which could lead to deficiencies in certain nutrients or less ability to protect themselves from chronic diseases[3]. The quantity of nutrients in these crops have been declining over the past 70 years[5].","['Mounting evidence from multiple scientific studies shows that many fruits, vegetables, and grains grown today carry less protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron, riboflavin, and vitamin C than those that were grown decades ago. This is an especially salient issue if more people switch to primarily plant-based diets, as experts are increasingly recommending for public health and for protecting the planet.', 'Vegetables like this freshly picked carrot lying on a garden bed of frisée endive are critical sources of nutrients. Mounting evidence shows that many fruits, vegetables, and grains grown today carry fewer nutrients than those grown decades ago. This trend means that “what our grandparents ate was healthier than what we’re eating today,” says Kristie Ebi, an expert in climate change and health at the University of Washington in Seattle. But studies have shown that changing farming methods can reverse these nutrient declines. Produce cultivated on farms that embrace regenerative farming practices is more nutritious.', 'To be clear: Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are still among the healthiest foods on the planet—but consumers may not be getting the nutrients they’re counting on from plant-based foods. And if these nutrient declines continue, some people may be at elevated risk for developing deficiencies in certain nutrients or less able to protect themselves from chronic diseases through good nutrition, experts say.', '- For example, over a 14-year period in the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, men and women with the highest intake of fruits and vegetables (8+ servings a day) were just as likely to have developed cancer as those who ate the fewest daily servings (under 1.5).

"What defines the shape of some drinking glasses to correspond to a specific beverage? For example, wine or scotch glasses have slightly different sizes of the leg and the part that holds the drink. Is it a historical matter?","The shape of drinking glasses is designed to enhance the flavours unique to specific beverages, such as red and white wines, whiskey, and other spirits[1][2]. The concept is credited to the Riedel Wine Glass Company, which first introduced it in 1973[2]. The shape of the glass affects the taste and aroma of the drink as it is designed to direct and enhance the aroma and help to maintain the temperature of the beverage[1][2][5]. The shape also helps to prevent an over-concentration of alcohol fumes[4][5].","['If you’ve ever had a glass of wine or fine spirits, like aged whiskey or cognac you’ve likely encountered the culture of specialized glassware. You probably know that there’s a specific glass for red wine and a different glass for white wine – but not many people know that beyond cultural aspects, the original intent of the glass shape was designed to enhance the flavours unique to specific red and white wines. Within whiskey, there are glasses or snifters that are designed for improving the drinking experience by directing and enhancing the aroma.', 'If we trace back the history of special shaped glassware to the roots of its origin, we’ll often hear the name ‘Riedel Wine Glass Company’. If you’re not already familiar with this prestigious glass maker, they are the family of glass makers from Austria who pioneered the idea in 1973 that the flavor of alcoholic beverages can be influenced by the shape of the glass. Though radical at the time, the notion that glass shape can alter wine’s taste and aroma has now become a culturally accepted phenomenon around the world. It’s common practice to serve red wines in a glass with a taller, wider bowl, whereas white wines are served in a glass with a smaller, narrower bowl. Looking to spirits and whiskeys, there’s wide bowled snifters and the smaller Glencairn glass. The serving etiquette for serving these alcoholic beverages is more common knowledge than the functional reasons why these glasses pair best for these drinks.', 'You’re probably wondering: “How can the shape of a glass have such an impact on the taste and aroma a drink?”. Let’s dive into the science why wine and spirits express their taste and aroma better in the proper glass than, let’s say, a plastic single-use cup.', 'In general, red wine glasses have larger bowls to help enhance the aromas that collect at the surface of the wine, and white wine glasses have more narrow bowls to help maintain temperature. From there, small nuances in width, shape, and length help highlight or encourage attributes like oxidation or carbonation. You may also take your environment into consideration. For example, if you are planning an outdoor dinner party, stemless tumblers may be more ideal that a long-stemmed glass that is more likely to get knocked over. Wine Enthusiast offers a multitude of glasses sure to meet any wine drinker’s needs, no matter which bottle is being uncorked.', 'Most whiskey glasses stick to a classic, tried-and-true rocks shape with a heavy bottom, allowing heat to transfer from the drinker’s hand to the spirit and evolving the aromas and taste of the whiskey over time. This set of Zenology whiskey glasses offers a whole new, premium experience for the discerning whiskey drinker eager to open that special bottle. These glasses were designed in conjunction with Wine Enthusiast Magazine’s Spirits Editor, Kara Newman, and are based off of the best-selling wine glasses. These handcrafted crystal glasses are tulip-shaped, but are wide enough to allow for ice cubes and prevent an over-concentration of alcohol fumes. This stemmed glassware prevents the heat transfer from hand-holding, keeping any premium scotch, bourbon or whiskey at the preferred temperature for each and every savored sip. These are the best whiskey glasses for premium bottles, and will become the go-to glassware for any beverage that deserves an extra touch of elegance.']"
Why do we need water to survive? What happens on a microscopic/cellular(?) level when we're dehydrated?,"We need water to survive because it is necessary for our body to perform many of its functions, such as maintaining its temperature, removing waste, and lubricating our joints. Water is also essential for our cells to function properly[3]. When we are dehydrated, our cells are unable to move useful substances and regulate their levels both inside and outside of cells due to a lack of water[4]. Additionally, dehydration can make our cardiovascular system work harder, cause our kidneys to retain more water, and cause fluid to be lost around the brain tissue, which will affect our overall cell function[5].","['Your body depends on water to survive. Every cell, tissue, and organ in your body needs water to work properly. For example, your body uses water to maintain its temperature, remove waste, and lubricate your joints. Water is needed for overall good health.', ""Without water, your body would stop working properly. Water makes up more than half of your body weight, and a person can't survive for more than a few days without it. Why? Your body has lots of important jobs and it needs water to do many of them. For instance, your blood, which contains a lot of water, carries oxygen to all the cells of your body. Without oxygen, those tiny cells would die and your body would stop working."", 'Water is one of the most vital nutrients for life on the planet. Without water, we would perish within a matter of days. Our cells require water to function and therefore it is important to remain adequately hydrated. Dehydration can promote the risk for both inflammation and numerous diseases. The risk for becoming dehydrated is increased in those who do not hydrate enough, who have electrolyte imbalances, the elderly, women, those living a sedentary lifestyle and those with pre-existing diseases.', '2. Fluid Ion Balance. Water is required by cells for the movement of useful substances and to regulate their levels both inside and outside of cells. During dehydration, ions are concentrated outside of cells and battle to move without depriving cells of fluids. The body eliminates less water when dehydrated, voiding more concentrated urine. During over-hydration, the opposite occurs, diluting ions and interfering with their movement in and out of cells.', 'The human body needs water to live, and the effects of dehydration can quickly turn serious and even life-threatening. As you lose fluid, your blood becomes more concentrated, making your cardiovascular system work harder to efficiently pump blood. A high blood concentration also makes your kidneys retain more water, which is why you urinate less. As dehydration progresses, you eventually lose fluid around the brain tissue which will affect your overall cell function. It is crucial to nip dehydration in the bud or avoid it altogether.']"
"if fat is the way energy is stored in our bodies, does this mean that a person with a higher fat percentage could go longer without eating than a person with a low fat percentage?","Generally speaking, yes, a person with higher fat percentage can go longer without eating than a person with a low fat percentage. Fat is the most energy-efficient form of food, supplying the body with 9 calories per gram. It is also the body's way of thinking ahead, storing extra energy as fat in order to use as fuel during times of food scarcity[3][5]. Our bodies also store fat in the abdomen and under the skin to use when it needs more energy[1][3][5], and it is a more efficient fuel per unit of weight than carbohydrate[3][5]. When calorie consumption is in balance, our bodies maintain a healthy supply of fat that can be used when needed[2], and stored fat is slowly released between meals to keep our cells supplied with fuel[4].","['Fats are the slowest source of energy but the most energy-efficient form of food. Each gram of fat supplies the body with about 9 calories, more than twice that supplied by proteins or carbohydrates. Because fats are such an efficient form of energy, the body stores any excess energy as fat. The body deposits excess fat in the abdomen (visceral fat) and under the skin (subcutaneous fat) to use when it needs more energy. The body may also deposit excess fat in blood vessels and within organs, where it can block blood flow and damage organs, often causing serious disorders.', ""When calorie consumption is in balance, we maintain a healthy supply of fat that's available when we need it. This extra energy reserve helps us survive longer periods of fasting—like when food is scarce or when we don't have a chance to eat. Fat stores are especially important during illness: they nourish our cells and provide the immune system with energy to fight off infections when we're too sick to eat."", ""Fat is a more efficient fuel per unit of weight than carbohydrate. Carbohydrate must be stored along with water. Our weight would double if we stored the same amount of energy as glycogen (plus the water that glycogen holds) that we store as body fat. Most of us have sufficient energy stores of fat (adipose tissue or body fat), plus the body readily converts and stores excess calories from any source (fat, carbohydrate, or protein) as body fat. In order for fat to fuel exercise, however, sufficient oxygen must be simultaneously consumed. The second part of this chapter briefly explains how pace or intensity, as well as the length of time that you exercise, affects the body's ability to use fat as fuel."", 'While it may seem like the fat that pads our bodies sits there, stubbornly refusing to budge, fat is a very active tissue that is constantly turning over its inventory. After a meal, fat is put into storage. Between meals, stored fat is slowly released, keeping our cells supplied with fuel. While the brain needs glucose, our liver, muscle, and fat cells prefer to burn fat.', ""Dietary fats are nutrients in food that the body uses to build cell membranes, nerve tissue (like the brain), and hormones. Fat in our diet is a source of calories. When you eat more calories than the body uses, the extra energy is stored as body fat. This is the body's way of thinking ahead: By saving fat for future use, it plans for times when food might be scarce and can use the stored fat as fuel.""]"
What is PETA doing wrong?,"PETA has been criticized for their extreme, ridiculous, offensive, and often laughable positions[2], their habit of upping the ante of bad taste and shock value[2], and for comparing animals to humans[1][3]. They have also been criticized for euthanizing tens of thousands of perfectly healthy animals that could have otherwise been adopted by someone who would have actually taken care of them[5].","['PETA feels that because people have domesticated animals it has caused an overpopulation disaster. The organization believes that animals would have been much better off if breeding them for pets never took place. PETA also contends that the “selfish” practice of keeping animals as pets keeps the animals from behaving naturally. Instead, humans tell them when to eat, drink, and go to the bathroom. Apparently, 85 million U.S. families who own a pet, according to the 2017-2018 National Pet Owners Survey, disagree with PETA.', 'While valuing livestock over people may be an indefensible argument, it’s typical of PETA’s overall strategy: to stake out extreme, ridiculous, offensive, and often laughable positions, in order to constantly redefine the edge of what’s considered “acceptable” philosophy and protest activity. Ten years ago, throwing fake blood on a fur coat, agitating for vegan cafeteria food, or objecting to Biology-class dissection were unusual behaviors. Today, these are commonplace — the radical line is now defined by firebombs, grand theft, stalking of scientists, and bloody physical assaults. For this, PETA deserves much of the blame; its habit of upping the ante of bad taste and shock value has redefined misanthropy and bad taste.', 'I think the biggest problem many people have with PETA’s campaigns is that they compare animals to humans. Personally I see no problem in that, most humans have a disconnect with animals and view them as products rather than living, breathing beings.', 'You’re stating that PETA is such an angel, trying to get more people to become vegan. Of course, I have nothing against vegans or vegatarians. You can do whatever you please, as long as it doesn’t hurt you or anybody else. But PETA tends to use shock tactics, as this website stated. They are SO much more than correct. This is a very risky tactic, so them already being hated for putting down completely healthy animals, 40,000 animals since 1998 to be exact, Is not the best remedy to heal their already infamous organization. Take the Zarate case for example.', 'PETA is a dangerous organization that must not be supported. They euthanize tens of thousands of perfectly healthy animals that could have otherwise been adopted by someone who would have actually taken care of them. No matter where you stand on veganism or vegetarianism, we all must stand together against the wretched excuse for activism that is PETA.']"
Why is so easy to eat unhealthy food but so hard to eat healthy?,"It can be difficult to change unhealthy eating habits because unhealthy food is so readily available[1]. Unhealthy food is often faster and easier to buy and prepare, and many people think it is less expensive[3][5]. Additionally, people are more likely to choose food based on what’s convenient and easy, versus what’s healthy and nutritious[4].

The study also shows that Americans have a long way to go in terms of prioritizing nutrition, which is the #1 determinant of health.', 'Unhealthy food isn’t just faster and easier —most people also think it’s less expensive. Half (50%) of Americans earning less than $50K/year believe healthy food is too expensive, and about same number (52%) say they never or only sometimes eat healthy food.

Nearly half of the people surveyed (49%) also say that they don’t always have time to buy and prepare healthy food.', 'It makes sense.

"Why do Japanese, Chinese, and Korean music have english lines in them?","Japanese, Chinese, and Korean music often have English lines in them for a variety of reasons. One reason is that English is often attached to western identity and imagery, and including English words in J-Pop music helps achieve a specific image or concept[1]. Another reason is that using English as part of the lyrics can help attract foreign listeners[2]. Additionally, language is also a factor in achieving success in the international music scene[3][4][5]. Furthermore, English words are also used to achieve rhyme and play-on-word techniques to make the song more artistic and diverse to the listener[4]. Finally, English words can make the song easier to sing along with, especially to foreign listeners, and make it more accessible to non-Japanese audiences[5].","['Since English is often attached to western identity and imagery, including English words in J-Pop music helps achieve a specific image or concept. Commonly, Japanese idol groups pursuing cool, modern, and sophisticated concepts are more likely to include English words in their lyrics. By using the English language in their music, musicians can quickly portray images and concepts often associated with western culture. One of the examples for this is the single “HOT SHOT” by Generations of Exile Tribe. The song is full of the English language, which helps portray the image they want to convey. Since the song features a powerful modern theme, the use of English helps in strengthening the concept and vibe throughout the song.', 'Why do Japanese songs use English? Well, arguably, including foreign words in the lyrics of a song attracts foreign listeners. This technique is not new in the world of music. Even western countries use foreign languages as part of the lyrics to help them reach more audiences. Since English is a “global language,” English words are most likely to appear in the lyrics.', 'Indeed, language is also a factor in achieving success in the international music scene. For example, the Japanese Pop Duo Pink Lady released an all-English track to break into the western music market. They had achieved success and even got their variety show in America.', 'Another reason why Japanese songs include English words and phrases is to achieve a certain level of artistry. In certain instances, composers use English words to achieve rhyme. For example, in Sansei Kawaii! by SKE48, the lyricist uses the English word in “Sansei kawaii! Sunshine furisosogu” to achieve rhyme. In addition, several play-on-word, using English, techniques are also observable in many J-pop music like repetition (e.g., Heart Ereki by AKB48), code ambiguation (Kissumai Kiss Your Mind by Orgel Sound J-Pop), and more. Through language switching, lyrics sound more artistic and diverse to the listener. With English in it, the song sounds more attractive to the general public (you also see this in English-language pop songs, using languages such as French or Spanish).', 'The inclusion of the English language helps Japanese songs reach across a further distance. It also makes the song easier to sing along with, especially to foreign listeners. Hence, it also makes the song more accessible to non-Japanese audiences. This technique is not new to the Japanese music scene. As early as the ’70s, musical acts tried to get into the international music scene.']"
why are Caribbean temperatures so stagnant?,"Caribbean temperatures are so stagnant because of the effects of climate change. Rising temperatures in the Caribbean affects labor productivity and other economic activities, and is expected to take a particularly large hit in Jamaica, where temperatures are expected to surge as much as 7 degrees[2]. Additionally, cold fronts from North America during the northern hemisphere winter push their way beneath the warm air of the Caribbean, forming strong updraughts and tall cumulonimbus clouds[4]. This has been a key reason that the Caribbean region has been vocal at international summits about the need to address global warming[5].","['But apart from its collateral effects on oceans and weather, rising temperature in the Caribbean is in-and-of-itself, a reason for concern. That is because consistently hotter days affect labor productivity and, through that and other channels, a wide range of economic activities. Some sectors are directly exposed to weather, like agriculture. But even other sectors, not so exposed to weather, like manufacturing, industry and services, could be harmed.', 'The losses will be significant. I used temperature projections for the Caribbean and a breakdown of GDP across sectors for each country, and combined those with the impact estimates from my analysis of the United States to reveal the magnitude of the effect on the region. In Trinidad and Tobago, there may be a tiny increase in economic growth because a larger share of its economy lies in the industrial sector. This includes the utilities that stand to benefit from the need for cooling. But in Jamaica, where temperatures are expected to surge as much as 7 degrees, to 87 degrees Fahrenheit, the services sector, which makes up the largest share of the economy, is expected to take a particularly large hit. And the same is likely to happen in Barbados and the Bahamas, though the impact may be smaller due to less dramatic increases in temperature.', 'The United States is, of course, more developed economically than the Caribbean, and we cannot be entirely sure that our analysis for the one place holds for the other. But most of the temperature effects that we see in the United States are driven by their impact on the southern states, where summer temperatures are almost identical to those of the Caribbean. Moreover, levels of development may not be as important as we think. In the United States, at least, more and less developed states suffer approximately the same impacts from rising temperatures. All this provides at least some confidence that our analysis of the United States can be transferred, if imperfectly, to the Caribbean.', 'Cold fronts affect the Caribbean region (especially the northern part of the region) during the northern hemisphere winter. During this period, cold air from North America moves into the Caribbean. There is a well defined boundary where this cold, dry air meets the warm, moist air of the Caribbean. The cold air is denser and heavier and so it pushes its way beneath the warm air. The warm air, which is lighter and less dense than the cold air, is forced to rise. There are strong updraughts and tall cumulonimbus clouds are formed. There is often heavy rain and thunderstorms.', 'When people think of climate change’s effects on the Caribbean, they tend to think of rising seas and extreme weather, like Irma and Maria – the Category 5 hurricanes that ripped through the region in September 2017, killing hundreds and causing billions of dollars in damage. Those calamities are a key reason that the Caribbean region, though a small emitter of greenhouse gases, has been vocal at international summits about the need to address global warming.']"
Can animals have other sexualities outside of heterosexuality?,"Yes, animals can have other sexualities outside of heterosexuality. Homosexual behavior has been documented in hundreds of animal species[3], and sexual preferences seem to be fluid rather than binary[3]. It may be that our historical interpretations of animal sexual behaviours have been moulded by human cultural perceptions about sexuality[1], and that animals that express a more flexible sexuality are more common than those that do not[1]. However, it is important to note that animals cannot be homosexual as such, as the reproductive instinct among animals is always directed towards an individual of the opposite sex[4]. The question of whether animals can be gay has long fascinated and caused consternation to scientists and laypeople alike[5].","['It may even be that our historical interpretations of animal sexual behaviours have been moulded by human cultural perceptions about sexuality. Viewing same-sex behaviours as necessarily paradoxical or costly, and a divergence from a baseline ”‘heterosexuality’ may in fact stem from our own outdated attitudes. In the future, with more research, we may well come to find that animals that express a more flexible sexuality are more common than those that do not.', 'Like humans, some animals are heterosexual, some are homosexual, and some are somewhere in between. Yep, humans aren’t the only ones born this way – giraffes, penguins, lions, and members of other species have been observed engaging in same-sex relationships, too.', 'Not as far as we know. Homosexual behavior has been documented in hundreds of animal species, but the same does not hold for gay-bashing. For starters, few animals are exclusively gay. Two female Japanese macaques might have playful sex with each other on Tuesday, then mate with males on Wednesday. Pairs of male elephants sometimes form years-long companionships that include sexual activity, while their heterosexual couplings tend to be one-night stands. For these and many other species, sexual preferences seem to be fluid rather than binary: Gay sex doesn’t make them gay, and straight sex doesn’t make them straight. In these cases, the concept of homophobia simply doesn’t apply.', 'Properly speaking, homosexuality does not exist among animals.... For reasons of survival, the reproductive instinct among animals is always directed towards an individual of the opposite sex. Therefore, an animal can never be homosexual as such. Nevertheless, the interaction of other instincts (particularly dominance) can result in behavior that appears to be homosexual. Such behavior cannot be equated with an animal homosexuality. All it means is that animal sexual behavior encompasses aspects beyond that of reproduction.', 'The question of whether animals can be gay is one that has long fascinated and caused consternation to scientists and laypeople alike.

"Why is it considered okay to talk to your pet if its a dog or cat etc, but not if its a fish?","Talking to your pet can provide a source of positive, nonverbal communication and help develop a child's empathy and understanding[2][3]. Pets, especially dogs, have evolved to become acutely attuned to humans and our behavior and emotions, and they can interpret our tone of voice, body language, and gestures[4]. They can also provide companionship and help prevent illness[5]. It is not considered okay to talk to a fish because they do not have the same capacity to understand and respond to human communication.","['While it’s true that people with pets often experience greater health benefits than those without, a pet doesn’t necessarily have to be a dog or a cat. A rabbit could be ideal if you’re allergic to other animals or have limited space but still want a furry friend to snuggle with. Birds can encourage social interaction and help keep your mind sharp if you’re an older adult. Snakes, lizards, and other reptiles can make for exotic companions. Even watching fish in an aquarium can help reduce muscle tension and lower your pulse rate.', '- Pets can provide a source of positive, nonverbal communication. The playful interaction and gentle touch from a well-trained, docile animal can help soothe an Alzheimer’s patient and decrease aggressive behavior—as can simply being exposed to bright aquariums or fish tanks.', '- A pet can help develop a young and expanding mind by teaching a child empathy and understanding. Kids can talk with their pet without a fear of rejection, which enables them to build their confidence, and even their vocabulary.', 'Pets have evolved to become acutely attuned to humans and our behavior and emotions. Dogs, for example, are able to understand many of the words we use, but they’re even better at interpreting our tone of voice, body language, and gestures.

Why do some animals leave their offspring before or when they are born/hatch? Wouldn't it be better for the species chance of survival if all the offspring were given time to grow and mature?,"Animals may leave their offspring before or when they are born/hatch for a variety of reasons. One reason is that some animals, such as artiodactyls, perissodactyls, cetaceans, and pinnipeds, give birth to relatively small, precocial offspring, which are better able to escape predators and require less time to mature[1]. Primates, bats, sloths, and anteaters also have a few large offspring that they mostly carry, which reduces risk of predation but limits the number[2]. Additionally, some animals are born in spring when favorable conditions and abundant food resources are available, increasing their chances of survival[3]. Other animals, such as megapode birds, are superprecocial, hatching with full-flight feathers[4]. Lastly, some animals, such as some bony fish, sharks, lizards, some snakes, and some invertebrates, use ovoviparity, in which the eggs are retained in the female until they hatch, which helps protect the eggs[5]. Therefore, it is not necessarily better for the species chance of survival for all the offspring to be given time to grow and mature.","['2. Artiodactyls, perissodactyls, cetaceans, and pinnipeds should give birth to a relatively small number of large, precocial offspring. Their offspring are born unprotected on the ground or in the sea. Offspring survival depends critically on offspring size, as in figure 1B, because large, well-developed offspring are better able to escape predators and require less time to mature. Additionally, thermoregulation is enhanced by the larger size and better insulation of the precocial condition.', '3. Primates, bats, sloths, and anteaters should also have a few large offspring. These mammals mostly carry their young, which reduces risk of predation but limits the number because newborn offspring must be sufficiently developed to hold on and to thermoregulate outside the protective microclimate of a nest or burrow. Additionally, only a small number of offspring can be closely attended while the mother forages, interacts with conspecifics, and escapes from predators.', 'It’s spring, and the flowers are blooming, the grass is green and baby wildlife are out. Spring provides these young animals with favorable conditions and abundant food resources, increasing their chances of survival. Some animals learn survival from their parents, but others receive little or no parental care. Within days or weeks after birth, they will venture into the world on shaky legs or fragile wings. Some will not survive, but those early unsteady steps and flights are part of normal development, as it helps young animals learn to take care of themselves.', 'A hastier alternative is employed by precocial animals, in which the young have open eyes, have hair or down, have large brains, and are immediately mobile and somewhat able to flee from, or defend themselves against, predators. For example, with ground-nesting birds such as ducks or turkeys, the young are ready to leave the nest in one or two days. Among mammals, most ungulates are precocial, being able to walk almost immediately after birth. Beyond the precocial are the superprecocial animals, such as the megapode birds, which hatch with full-flight feathers. Some ecological niches require young to be precocial for survival, such as cetaceans: restricted to water, their young would quickly drown if they were immobile and helpless.', 'In ovoviparity, fertilized eggs are retained in the female, and the embryo obtains its nourishment from the egg’s yolk. The eggs are retained in the female’s body until they hatch inside of her, or she lays the eggs right before they hatch. This process helps protect the eggs until hatching. This occurs in some bony fish (like the platyfish Xiphophorus maculatus, Figure 13.7 b), some sharks, lizards, some snakes (garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis), some vipers, and some invertebrate animals (Madagascar hissing cockroach Gromphadorhina portentosa).']"
Why does the FCC exist and why isn't the internet and net-access just free market with encouraged competition and if it's just for corporate greed how is it legal?,"The FCC exists to promote competition, innovation and investment in networks, and to protect an open, accessible, and free internet[2][4].

Furthermore, the FCC was created with the understanding that they would regulation the sector as a natural monopoly, meaning they would create and establish monopolies for these businesses and regulate them as such[5].

Further, the FCC has the benefit of bringing about the very circumstances that necessitate its control of distribution. As Christopher Yoo has pointed out, because ""the amount of spectrum available...is itself a product of regulation, any reliance on spectrum scarcity in effect allows regulation to serve as the constitutional justification for other regulations."" Similarly, the lack of competition in broadband provision has been exacerbated by FCC regulation from the very start, when it restricted cable entry and later encouraged local cable monopolies akin to the telephone monopoly it was overseeing. Structural regulation and architectural censorship, then, is a self-reinforcing problem that threatens some basic American values about free speech.', 'The FCC and media-access groups have long favored structural rules, not because they encourage competition but because those non-economic remedies ostensibly increase the diversity of media viewpoints and local, educational, and public-affairs programming. Many scholars wish to equip the FCC to handle even larger civic-minded aspirations in the Internet Age. Professor Tim Wu, for instance, who coined the phrase ""net neutrality"" and lobbied for the FCC\'s internet rules, argued in congressional testimony that the FCC should be charged with ""protecting an open society,"" ""safeguarding the political process,"" and prohibiting media companies from silencing political viewpoints.', 'the FCC was created with the understanding that they would regulation the sector as a natural monopoly meaning that it was in lock step with creating/establishing monopolies for these businesses and to regulate them as such.']"
"Why have governments made such a push to go green and use less oil then when we do the entire worlds economy crashes from declining oil prices, didn't they see this coming?","Governments have pushed to go green and use less oil because the world is not running out of oil and it will need to transition away from oil and other fossil fuels while they are abundant and inexpensive[1].

The goal is to avoid the sorts of destabilizing anti-government protests seen in France, Iran and Ecuador when energy-price increases were proposed[5].

Technology has brought about a boom in oil production; geologists long knew the resources were there, but did not know how to make money producing them.

Wouldn't producing cultured meat increase the chances of producing cancer cells?,"Currently, there is no evidence that producing cultured meat would increase the chances of producing cancer cells. Cultured meat may be far healthier than regular meat because producers are able to control what the meat consists of, such as its fat content[1]. Furthermore, there is still research being conducted to ensure that contamination is kept out of cultured meat when it is manufactured on a large scale. Ultimately, it remains to be seen whether cultured meat will be competitive in comparison to regular meat[5].","['While regular meat is linked with a high risk of heart disease, diabetes and cancer, cultured meat may be far healthier. The creator of the first-ever lab-grown beef burger said: “We gain greater control over what the meat consists of, for example, its fat content.” If cultured meat producers are able to replace dangerous fatty acids with healthier ones, such as Omega-3, then there could be considerable health benefits. It would not be far-fetched to imagine cultured meat that is specifically designed to be “saturated “fat-free or “Vitamin B12 rich”. Without the use of livestock antibiotics and hormones, that’s a lot less unwanted chemicals entering the body.', 'The risks are even more dire when it comes to slow-growing animal cells in large reactors, because bacteria will overwhelm the cells more quickly. At the scale envisioned by proponents of cultured meat, there is little room for error. But if aseptic production turns out to be necessary, it isn’t going to come cheap. Humbird found that a Class 8 clean room big enough to produce roughly 15 million pounds of cultured meat a year would cost about $40 to $50 million dollars. That figure doesn’t reflect the cost of equipment, construction, engineering, or installation. It simply reflects the materials needed to run a sterile work environment, a clean room sitting empty.', 'Livestock farmers are worried about the steady progress made by the aforementioned research. Indeed, the potentially effortless and low-cost production of in vitro meat is supposed to make it more economical than regular meat. Moreover, the issue of spoilage and of pathogens are different between cultured meat and conventional meat: keeping contamination out of cultured meat is going to be a challenge when manufacturing is scaled up and one is using a factory and not a laboratory.', 'Ethically, cultured meat aims to use considerably fewer animals than conventional livestock, which makes the product attractive to vegetarians and vegans. However, a few animals will still need to be reared so that their cells can be harvested to produce in vitro meat.', 'In conclusion, it seems clear that research projects on cultured meat have had a limited scope as in vitro meat development is still in its infancy. The product will evolve continuously in line with new discoveries and advances that optimize the production, quality and efficiency of cell division. It remains to be seen whether this progress will be enough for artificial meat to be competitive in comparison to conventional meat and the increasing number of meat substitutes.']"
"Is there any evidence to suggest that current animals have evolved to overcome specific environmental challenges due to human intervention? I.E. Roads, Buildings, Pollution?","Yes, there is evidence to suggest that current animals have evolved to overcome specific environmental challenges due to human intervention. For example, studies have shown that learning allows animals to identify new food sources, new predators, differentiate suitable from nonsuitable habitats or mates, and even adjust their phenology[1]. Additionally, human-released chemical pollution can be mitigated by physiological adaptations, such as enzymatic metabolic adaptations that could be costly in non-polluted conditions[3]. Human-wildlife conflict in cities and other human activities can also cause evolutionary changes in animals that may lead to ecological and societal consequences.","['Up to this point, our discussion has focused on variation in immediate behavioural responses to novel situations. Even if animals do not respond well immediately to a novel situation, as long as they survive the initial exposure, they have the opportunity to learn and thus improve their ability to cope with HIREC. Virtually, all animal species can learn, that is, change their patterns of response to external cues through experience. Many studies have shown that learning allows individuals to identify new food sources (Galef 1988), new predators (Brown and Chivers 2005), differentiate suitable from nonsuitable habitats or mates (Dugatkin and Godin 1992) and even adjust their phenology (Grieco et al. 2002).

At present, reliable methods for inferring these cryptic dynamics in nature are lacking, despite their likely prevalence and importance . Increasing attention should be directed toward this difficult but critical enterprise. We have also tended to emphasize particular simple chains of causal interactions, such as from a particular human activity to the evolution of a particular species to a particular ecological response to a particular societal consequence. However, many other interactions likely influence each particular link in any instance, and we therefore need to move beyond these ‘focal species' approaches.""]"
Why do Ice Sheets melting raise the ocean level globally? Woudln't the mass of the Ice Sheet be replaced by the water melted from it.,"Melting Ice Sheets raise the ocean level globally because when the mass of the Ice Sheet is melted, the meltwater is added to the world's oceans, which causes them to rise. This is compounded by the fact that the melting Ice Sheet causes a change in Earth's gravity field which causes the sea level to drop near the areas of melt and rise elsewhere[1]. Additionally, the melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is expected to double by the end of the century if emissions continue to rise, and melting all the ice on Greenland would raise global sea levels by 20 feet[1][3][4][5]. Additionally, if all the ice in Antarctica melted, it would result in global sea levels rising by 187 feet (57 meters)[3][4][5].","[""Going forward, ice loss in Greenland and Antarctica will have varying effects on Earth's oceans. One way loss of ice from the ice sheets will affect the ocean is by changing the ice sheet pull on the nearby ocean. The ice sheet itself has mass that exerts a gravitational force on the surrounding ocean. A loss of mass from the ice sheet causes nearby ocean levels to fall as the mass and gravity of the ice sheet decreases. However, the sea level in areas far from the ice sheet rises. Consequently, ice sheet contribution to sea level rise—even if it were the same amount—would have different impacts, depending on whether the contribution came from Greenland or Antarctica. Broadly, ice sheet mass loss causes the sea level nearby to drop but causes sea levels far away to rise."", ""However, all these studies underscore an important point: Being far away from a melting ice sheet is no source of safety. In fact, the opposite is true. Because of changes in Earth's gravity field resulting from ice sheet mass loss, ocean sea level will actually drop near the areas of melt and rise elsewhere. Miami, Tokyo, Shanghai, and Los Angeles are just a few of the coastal cities that experience higher sea levels caused by faraway ice-sheet melt."", 'How much and how quickly these Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets melt in the future will largely determine how much ocean levels rise in the future. If emissions continue to rise, the current rate of melting on the Greenland ice sheet is expected to double by the end of the century. Alarmingly, if all the ice on Greenland melted, it would raise global sea levels by 20 feet.', ""Global sea level rise is caused by a combination of meltwater from glaciers, including ice sheets, and thermal expansion of sea water warming. (Ocean water takes up more volume as it warms.) Antarctica and Greenland, the world's two ice sheets, make up the vast majority of Earth's ice. If these ice sheets melted entirely, sea level would rise by more than 70 meters (230 feet). These ice sheets are tipping toward imbalance, with more mass leaving the ice sheet than is replaced by snowfall, especially in West Antarctica and Greenland. According to the 2021 IPCC Report, the planet has already entered a phase of irreversible sea level rise for hundreds if not thousands of years to come."", '""If Antarctica melted, global sea levels would rise dramatically. This would have a devastating effect on coastal cities and low-lying regions around the world, as sea levels could rise by as much as 187 feet (57 meters) from the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet. The resulting flooding, coastal erosion, and extreme weather events would cause displacement of millions of people and significantly disrupt the global economy and ecosystems. Additionally, melting Antarctic ice would reduce the overall salinity of the ocean, resulting in changes in ocean circulation patterns, which could further impact global climate patterns.""']"
Why can't neural networks model the brains of small invertebrates.,"Neural networks are limited in their ability to model the brains of small invertebrates because the brains of small invertebrates are much simpler and less complex than those of humans, with far fewer neurons and neural connections. Additionally, the costs of generating emotions in insects is relatively high, and the benefits are minimal, so evolution has opted for the cheaper option[3]. Furthermore, neural networks require massive bidirectional connections across multiple brain areas, which are not present in small invertebrates[4]. Finally, lower invertebrates have simple nervous systems, such as a circular nerve net or a chain of segmentally organized ganglia, which limits their ability to process and integrate information[5].","['As the study of the human brain is complicated by its sheer scale, complexity, and impracticality of invasive experiments, neuroscience research has long relied on model organisms. The brains of macaque, mouse, zebrafish, fruit fly, nematode, and others have yielded many secrets that advanced our understanding of the human brain. Here, we propose that adding miniature insects to this collection would reduce the costs and accelerate brain research. The smallest insects occupy a special place among miniature animals: despite their body sizes, comparable to unicellular organisms, they retain complex brains that include thousands of neurons. Their brains possess the advantages of those in insects, such as neuronal identifiability and the connectome stereotypy, yet are smaller and hence easier to map and understand. Finally, the brains of miniature insects offer insights into the evolution of brain design.', 'If a large behavioural repertoire is possible with a miniature brain, what benefits are obtained by an animal investing in a larger brain? Because brain size scales allometrically with body size , an explanation is that biophysical constraints force larger animals to have more and/or larger neurons . It is for instance, easy to imagine that the bigger muscles of larger animals will require greater numbers of motor neurons and axons with larger diameters to cover longer distances . More neurons may also allow greater replication of neuronal circuits, adding precision to sensory processes, detail to perception, more parallel processing and enlarged storage capacity . These explanations are however insufficient because substantial variation in brain size remains even when the allometric effect of body size is taken out . Given that neural tissue is extremely costly to maintain, what is the purpose of expanding the brain beyond allometric rules?', 'Evolutionary theory suggests that insects will be selected to have emotions if the benefits of having them are greater than the costs of generating them. However, the costs appear to be heavy, and the benefits seem minimal. Mammals have emotions because they dedicate neural resources to the neural circuits that create emotions, as was mentioned in the section above. Nervous systems are very expensive for animals. Insects, in particular, have opted for the economy model and have very small brains. Given the size of an insect brain (about 100,000 neurons for a fruit fly), additional neurons dedicated to an ‘emotional’ neural circuit would be relatively expensive in terms of energetics and resources. Robots show that it is possible to produce the same behaviour without the cost. Evolution should choose the cheaper option.', 'This issue becomes important because work on humans suggests that phenomena such as emotions and consciousness are the function of complex neural networks that link up relevant brain areas. These types of networks require massive bidirectional connections across multiple brain areas. The limited number of output neurons from some of the major integrative brain structures in the insect is likely to constrain the ability of insects to produce the type of complicated neural networks that drive human emotional behaviour, including the perception of pain.', ""Lower invertebrates have simple nervous systems such as a circular nerve net or a chain of segmentally organized ganglia. Such anatomical organization may represent a more distributed form of control, where sensory-motor integration occurs closer to the body part involved. This may increase efficiency by restricting central nervous control to limited fast responses to specific external stimuli (i.e., reflexes), which requires only limited information processing. More developed invertebrates, with their highly developed sensory structures, show a more complex nervous system and the development of brains in the animals' rostral part. This more advanced nervous system allows them to receive, process, and respond in greater variety to distant stimuli in the animal's direction of travel. Here interneurons become a major neuroarchitectural element within the CNS and are a key element in processing and integrating information.17""]"
why we need meat in our diets?,"We need meat in our diets because it is a good source of protein, minerals, vitamins and fat.

How do fishermen on those large trawlers with nets catch the exact fish they are looking for?,"Fishermen on large trawlers with nets use trawlers with fine meshes that do not let juveniles, eggs, and larvae escape[2]. They can also adjust the size of the mesh and the depth of the net to target certain species[3][4]. They also use different types of nets, such as nets for trawling in surface waters and for trawling in deep water and over the bottom[5], and may use larger meshes for pelagic species that do not respond much to ropes or wires, but can be guided by sheets of tight netting[4].","['A fishing trawler.

Trawl nets designed to capture shrimp have a wide but low net mouth and extremely short cables or bridles. Trawl nets for clupeids and mackerels have very large net mouth openings. To make the net mouth as big as possible without creating too heavy a towing load, large meshes are used. These meshes are big enough for the fish to swim through with ease, but this does not happen if the net is properly constructed. So pelagic species while they do not respond much to ropes or wires, will be guided by sheets of tight netting even if the mesh sizes are very large.', 'Nets for trawling in surface waters and for trawling in deep water and over the bottom.

This is because as mammals they need air to breathe, and without the water to keep them cool, they overheat and lose too much water via evaporation from their lungs[5]. They also suffer from the pressure of their own weight on their organs as they are weightless in the water[1][4]. Very few rescues have been successful, usually only if the animal itself cooperates and wants to be rescued[1].","['Beached whales usually die from dehydration, their internal organs slowly being crushed by their own weight.

The reason you may see someone splashing a beached whale with water is to cool it down, since whales lying out in the sun may overheat.', '""When whales, including small whales or dolphins become stranded on beaches they suffer from the pressure of their own weight on their organs,in the water they are weightless. They also suffer from overheating as they have blubber that insulates them in the water and outside of the water causing them to overheat. This is why we place wet towels and cold water on their fins and flukes when do they strand to help keep their body temperature down. Unfortunately most stranded whales do not survive once they have beached themselves.', 'Cetacean stranding often leads to death due to dehydration. Whales have an incredibly thick layer of insulating blubber. Without the water to keep them cool, they overheat and lose too much water via evaporation from their lungs.']"
How is destroying Ivory not destructive to Elephants?,"Destroying ivory is not destructive to elephants because it is a technique used by governments and conservation groups to deter the poaching of elephants and to suppress the illegal ivory trade[1][3][5]. It is also a signal to the world that ivory is not for sale, which undermines the credibility of demand-reduction efforts[3][5] and prevents the erosion of any current stigma associated with ivory consumption[5]. Furthermore, it is an ethical way to reduce the market value of ivory and keep it off the market[2][3][5]. Destroying ivory is difficult and can be done by burning or crushing[1][2][4], but even burning is inefficient and requires extreme conditions over a long period of time to be effective[2].","['The destruction of ivory is a technique used by governments and conservation groups to deter the poaching of elephants for their tusks and to suppress the illegal ivory trade. As of 2016[update], more than 263 tonnes (580,000 lb) of ivory have been destroyed, typically by burning or crushing, in these high-profile events in 21 countries around the world. Kenya held the first event in 1989, as well as the largest event in 2016, when a total of 105 tonnes (231,000 lb) of ivory were incinerated.', ""Research performed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in 2008, found burning to be an inefficient and highly challenging way to destroy ivory when compared to crushing. Like human teeth, elephant tusks are resistant to burning. Simple burning typically just chars the outside; it requires extreme conditions over a long period of time to destroy ivory effectively. Using specialized equipment to burn a tusk at 1,800 °F (1,000 °C), its weight decreases by only 0.25 ounces (7 g) each minute (an average African elephant tusk is about 50 lb (23 kg) and can weigh as much as 130 lb (59 kg). For each of Kenya's burns, organizers used jet oil to increase the temperature and it still persists for about a week."", 'In some corrupt countries, ivory burns and crushes can act as a way to steal ivory because it is not all carefully recorded in its destruction. Although initially these acts made a statement as a cry for help, such as with the first Kenya burn in 1989 that helped put ivory out of fashion in the U.S. and Europe, many in Asia find destruction to be against their culture and think the ivory could be used for making an artistic monument as a long-term statement instead. It is the Asians, especially the Chinese, whose viewpoints on this issue count the most, as they are the main consumers of ivory. Ivory crushes can detract from what is really needed to save elephants: much greater efforts on law enforcement and improving ways to protect elephants in their natural habitat.', 'Destroying ivory by any practical means is difficult. Burning is the most common method of large-scale destruction of ivory. When Kenya burned 12 tons of it in 1989, it created a major media spectacle and inspired similar actions around the world. More recently, crushing methods have also been used, as well as combinations of crushing and burning.', 'To most economists, destroying something of market value is anathema. But ethically, elephant ivory should have no material value, and elephant tusks should only be regarded as valuable on living elephants. Back to the economics, crushing a stockpile of confiscated ivory sends a signal to the world that ivory is not for sale. Countries tend to keep ivory in anticipation of being able to sell it in the future. This undermines the credibility of demand-reduction efforts; if the trade is likely to be legalized in the future, any current stigma associated with ivory consumption will be eroded, further fueling poaching.']"

"Why do chickens lay eggs all of the time, while many other birds only do so once a year?","Chickens lay eggs almost daily because they have been bred to ovulate more frequently than other birds[4]. This means they are producing eggs more frequently than other birds, who only lay eggs once or twice a year[4]. Additionally, chickens lay both fertilized and unfertilized eggs, as the egg is mostly developed before being fertilized[3]. Under ideal conditions, chickens will lay an egg once every 24 to 26 hours[5].","['People ask me all the time why chickens lay eggs daily and seemingly other birds lay them once or twice a year. Here is my answer!!', 'Why is it that chickens can/do lay unfertilized or fertilized eggs almost daily and other birds seem to lay eggs once or twice a year?', 'The next question is perhaps, ""Why do chickens lay unfertilized eggs at all?"" The reason is that the egg is mostly developed before being fertilized. The chicken cannot know in advance whether the egg will end up fertilized or not, so it just has to go ahead and grow the egg in the hopes that it will be fertilized. In the wild, this system works well because mating among fowls is common and most eggs do end up fertilized.', 'Some chicken breeds lay more eggs than others. Laying hens have been bred to ovulate more frequently than other birds, this means they are producing eggs more frequently. Breeds who lay less often do not take longer to form an egg, they simply have a longer waiting period between ovulations.', 'Under ideal conditions, chickens will lay an egg once every 24 to 26 hours. Hens might take a short vacation from laying eggs and the reasons range from life stage to when the sun rises and sets.']"
Why are cows so sacred in India that they cannot be slaughtered and beef cannot be eaten there,"Cows are sacred in India for a variety of reasons. Historically, the cow was not always a sacred animal, as evidence suggests that Hindu kings regularly sacrificed and ate cattle during the Vedic period (1000-5000 B.C.)[3]. However, Brahmins later made the cow a sacred animal and beef-eating became a sacrilege[5]. Hindus now worship the cow as Gaumata, viewing it as a symbol of selfless giving and gentleness[4]. Furthermore, the cow is seen as embodying the principle of ahimsa, or non-violence[4].","['ELI5: Why are cows so sacred in India that they cannot be slaughtered and beef cannot be eaten there', '""""It was not that the cow was not sacred in Vedic times, it was because of her sacredness that it is ordained in the Vajasaneyi Samhita that beef should be eaten.', ""The debate of the sacredness of the cow is an issue even amongst India’s historians with some arguing that the “holy cow” is a relatively recent phenomenon exploited by political and religious groups. In The Myth of The Holy Cow, historian Dwijendra Narayan Jha says that ancient Hindus ate beef—the cow got its revered status around 500 A.D. coinciding with an agricultural boom on the subcontinent. Jha's research offers copious evidence that ancient Hindu kings regularly sacrificed and ate animals including cattle. Cattle, even cow, meat was not sacred during the Vedic period (1000-5000 B.C.) which was the time when Hinduism’s oldest scriptures—the Vedas—were written."", 'To Hindus, the cow is now worshipped as Gaumata (mother cow) because it provides milk to everyone. It symbolizes selfless giving. There are about 3,000 Gaushalas (cow shelters) in India where old and infirm cows are looked after. The cow, to many Hindus, embodies gentleness and non-violence. Hinduism holds the belief that all living creatures are sacred and promotes the idea of ahimsa (non-violence). “In China, dogs are killed for their meat and leather,” says Poorva Joshipura, CEO, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, India. “In the United States, where they are loved and kept in homes, they aren’t killed. So when people call for cow slaughter bans, there isn’t always an ulterior motive.”', 'As has been said, the Brahmins made the cow a sacred animal. They did not stop to make a difference between a living cow and a dead cow. The cow was sacred, living or dead. Beef-eating was not merely a crime. If it was only a crime it would have involved nothing more than punishment. Beef-eating was made a sacrilege. Anyone who treated the cow as profane was guilty of sin and unfit for association. The Broken Men who continued to eat beef became guilty of sacrilege.']"
How can cows possibly create more of a carbon foot print then cars?,"Cows produce methane gas, which is a potent greenhouse gas that is 23 times more damaging to the climate than the carbon dioxide from cars[1]. Livestock production, such as cows, produce 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions[2], and food accounts for 18% of carbon footprints, with about half of those emissions coming from meat and dairy[3]. Cattle are the No. 1 agricultural source of greenhouse gases worldwide and a single cow will belch about 220 pounds of methane per year[4]. While sustainable grazing practices won't eliminate methane produced by the cows, they can offset it, potentially sequestering 16 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2050[5].","[""It's been estimated that methane gas from cows is 23 times more damaging to the climate than the carbon dioxide from cars. However, the CO2 from cars sticks around a lot longer than the methane, contributing more to global warming."", 'Livestock production—primarily cows—produce 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. The majority of that is in the form of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that is a natural byproduct of how some livestock process food. But as Christopher Booker reports, scientists are hoping that small tweaks in what cows eat can dramatically reduce a big source of climate emissions.', 'As I mentioned on a recent podcast interview, the largest contributors to U.S. carbon footprints are “cars, coal, cows and consumption, roughly in that order.” Motor vehicles are by far the largest source of emissions on both production-based (~40%) and consumption-based (about 35%) approaches. In states with coal-fired electricity, emissions from household energy are often larger than transportation and the range of electricity carbon footprints between locations is quite high. In California, for example, electricity accounts for only ~5% of carbon footprints; in the Bay Area it’s 2% and in the East Bay only 1%. Food comes in third (~18%), with about half of those emissions coming from meat and dairy. Of course, energy, transportation, food, goods services...it’s all consumption, so the answer to the title of the blog is consumption is by far the largest contributor to household carbon footprints, no matter the location.', 'Cattle are the No. 1 agricultural source of greenhouse gases worldwide. Each year, a single cow will belch about 220 pounds of methane. Methane from cattle is shorter lived than carbon dioxide but 28 times more potent in warming the atmosphere, said Mitloehner, a professor and air quality specialist in the Department of Animal Science.', 'While sustainable grazing practices won’t eliminate methane produced by the cows, they can offset it. According to Project Drawdown, this solution could sequester 16 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2050.']"
How the hell do they build Dam's?,"Dams are usually built to control floods and facilitate shipping, store water for irrigation, and generate hydropower[5]. The construction of large dams typically involves the collaboration of large multinational corporations and foreign bondholders, and is often associated with payoffs to corrupt regimes, staggering debts, and habitat devastation[2]. Hydropower dams work by stopping up a river’s flow and channeling its water through a turbine to produce electricity[4]. However, the construction of dams can have negative impacts on the people who live along the rivers, as it disrupts the rise and fall of the river, making it difficult for them to grow crops or graze their cattle[1]. Dams can also take away the essence of what a river is[3], and in the US, only 3% of dams are hydropower facilities, supplying just under 7% of power demand[5].","[""Why are these people who live along the rivers worse off after a dam is built? The most important resource for them is the river, and especially the rise and fall of the river. As the river level drops during the dry season, they grow crops along the river banks. If they are cattle people, they lose out because during the dry season, when there's no more grass out on the plains, you drive the cattle down to the rivers and they graze on the grass that grows along the banks. When you build a dam, the river level doesn't rise and fall like that, so there is no longer a place for these people to grow their crops or graze their cattle."", 'Hence the dichotomy is stark. Construction of new hydroelectric dams has halted and even reversed in the United States, while construction continues across Europe and is even more evident in the developing world. The mega-dam projects under way outside Europe are often championed by the construction arms of large multinational corporations and the foreign bondholders who put up the cash to build them. Payoffs to corrupt regimes, staggering debts bequeathed to national governments and wholesale habitat devastation are just costs of doing business.', 'In the very center of conservationist hell, mused John McPhee, surrounded by chainsaws and bulldozers and stinking pools of DDT, stands a dam. He’s not the only one to feel that way. “They take away the essence of what a river is,” Stanley says.', 'Hydropower dams work by stopping up a river’s flow and channeling its water through a turbine to produce electricity. Most of the world’s hydropower comes from large dams, which are defined as having a wall height of over 15 meters (49.2 feet). The first large dam was built in Egypt in 1902, with the 20th century seeing the construction of 40,000 large dams worldwide.', 'Yet only 3% of dams in the US are hydropower facilities—together supplying about just under 7% of U.S. power demand. Most dams were built for other reasons. They restrained rivers to control floods and facilitate shipping. They stored enormous volumes of water for irrigating the desert and in doing so reshaped the landscape of half the country. “The West developed through the construction of dams because it allowed the control of water for development,” says Emily Stanley, a limnologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.']"
Why is there still debate whether or not there is a climate change issue?,"There is still a debate about climate change because there is still disagreement about the key scientific facts, such as the extent to which human activities have contributed to it, the climate system's responsiveness to any given level of greenhouse gases, how the climate will change at local and regional scales, and what the consequences of global warming will be[2]. Additionally, some organizations, particularly those with members in extractive industries, have attempted to convince the public that climate change is not happening or that it is not caused by human influence, to sow doubt in the scientific consensus[3]. In recent years, some climate change skeptics have changed their positions and acknowledge the reality of global warming[3][4]. Furthermore, large majorities of those who care most about this issue think it is very likely that climate change will bring harm to the environment, while those who care less are less likely to believe this[5].","['The controversy is, by now, political rather than scientific: there is a scientific consensus that global warming is happening and is caused by human activity. Disputes over the key scientific facts of global warming are more prevalent in the media than in the scientific literature, where such issues are treated as resolved, and such disputes are more prevalent in the United States and Australia than globally.', 'Political and popular debate concerning the existence and cause of global warming includes the reasons for the increase seen in the instrumental temperature record, whether the warming trend exceeds normal climatic variations, and whether human activities have contributed significantly to it. Scientists have resolved these questions decisively in favor of the view that the current warming trend exists and is ongoing, that human activity is the cause, and that it is without precedent in at least 2000 years. Public disputes that also reflect scientific debate include estimates of how responsive the climate system might be to any given level of greenhouse gases (climate sensitivity), how the climate will change at local and regional scales, and what the consequences of global warming will be.', 'The global warming controversy concerns the public debate over whether global warming is occurring, how much has occurred in modern times, what has caused it, what its effects will be, whether any action can or should be taken to curb it, and if so what that action should be. In the scientific literature, there is a strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view, though a few organizations with members in extractive industries hold non-committal positions, and some have attempted to convince the public that climate change is not happening, or if the climate is changing it is not because of human influence, attempting to sow doubt in the scientific consensus.', 'In recent years some climate change skeptics have changed their positions regarding global warming. Ronald Bailey, author of Global Warming and Other Eco-Myths (published by the Competitive Enterprise Institute in 2002), stated in 2005, ""Anyone still holding onto the idea that there is no global warming ought to hang it up."" By 2007, he wrote ""Details like sea level rise will continue to be debated by researchers, but if the debate over whether or not humanity is contributing to global warming wasn\'t over before, it is now.... as the new IPCC Summary makes clear, climate change Pollyannaism is no longer looking very tenable.""', 'Large majorities of those who care most about this issue think it is very likely that climate change will hurt the environment. Roughly three-quarters of those deeply concerned about climate issues think climate change will very likely bring harm to animal life (74%), damage to forests and plants life (74%), more droughts (73%), more severe storms (74%), and damage to shorelines from rising sea levels (74%). By contrast, roughly a third of those who care “some” about this issue say each of these possible effects is very likely. Many of those who do not care at all or not too much about the issue of climate change say the evidence of warming is uncertain; this group is particularly skeptical that any of these harms will come to pass.

Why can't we start a farm in America where we breed a bunch of Rhinos or other endangered animals.,"It is difficult to start a farm in America where we breed a bunch of Rhinos or other endangered animals for a few reasons. First, the debate over the conservation potential of wildlife farming is likely to attract widespread attention due to the fact that trade restrictions agreed upon through CITES are failing in many instances, and wildlife farming is likely to play an increasing role in the anti-poaching debate[2]. Second, the majority of people in China are against the idea of keeping endangered species in zoos and jail-like enclosures on commercial farms[1]. Finally, some people are promoting wildlife farming as a way to boost rural incomes and supply protein to a hungry world[4], while others are arguing that funds generated from the horn sale will go back into conservation[5]. Therefore, it would be difficult to start a farm in America for these reasons.","['Without action, these animals could soon survive only in zoos or jail-like enclosures on commercial farms. “I personally don’t want to live in a world where rhinos, tigers, bears, and other endangered species are just like cows and pigs. But neither does the majority in China,” said Mills. “This is not a matter of East versus West. As with climate change, this is a matter of taking a stand together for protecting our planet’s wellbeing and natural history.”', 'The debate over the conservation potential of wildlife farming is likely to attract widespread attention next month, when the 182 member nations of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meet in Johannesburg. Neighboring Swaziland has proposed legalizing the rhino horn trade, in a bid to make rhino ranching a commercial enterprise. That effort is almost certain to fail. But given the reality that “trade restrictions agreed through CITES are failing in many instances,” as Challender and MacMillan put it, farming of other wildlife species is likely to play an increasing role in the anti-poaching debate.', 'Nor is the idea of wildlife farming as a conservation tool particularly new. Ranchers in parts of southern Africa that are too dry for domestic livestock began raising wildlife more than a century ago, for trophy hunting, the meat trade, and tourism. Those ranches played a critical role in the recovery of a mountain zebra subspecies, black wildebeests, white rhinos, and bontebok and sable antelopes, among others, according to Andrew Taylor, co-author of a recent report on wildlife ranching for South Africa’s Endangered Wildlife Trust.', 'Food security consultants are promoting wildlife farming as a way to boost rural incomes and supply protein to a hungry world. So are public health experts who view properly managed captive breeding as a way to prevent emerging diseases in wildlife from spilling over into the human population.

Why are baby animals instinctively cuter to us humans but human babies are not?,"There are several reasons why baby animals are instinctively cuter to us humans than human babies. One is that humans have had immense control over the evolution of domesticated cats and dogs, changing their appearance over generations through selective breeding[1]. Another reason is that humans have a powerful nurturing instinct for their own children which spills over into an affection for anything that loosely resembles them[2]. Additionally, humans are born too early and need a lot of care, so they need to make sure their young are appealing enough to receive it[3]. Furthermore, baby animals have large eyes and fine faces, which make them appealing to humans[4], and they are also cleverly plucking on our heartstrings to make sure they stay alive[5].","['We know what you’re thinking here: why have humans evolved to find baby animals cuter than our own?

Scientists believe that the powerful nurturing instinct we have for our own children spills over into an affection for anything that even loosely resembles them.', '“Human beings basically have a response to what we call ‘cuteness’ as we come to the world too early. We’re not quite cooked. Most animals can immediately get up and walk around after birth. We can’t. We need a lot of care – and need to make sure our young are appealing enough to receive it.”', '-   -   -   -   - It is a universal fact: we find baby animals more cute and pleasing to look at than their parents. They win over us with their big eyes and fine faces. The need to be appealing to adult animals is an advantage because baby animals face some of the most difficult challenges in the animal kingdom. But what makes an infant animal appealing to humans?', 'It’s hard to judge whether other species experience the same pangs of love for cute creatures that we do, but this caretaking instinct may be particularly strong in humans because our offspring rely on us for far longer than those of every other mammal. Horses and cows can walk within hours of being born, for example, and cats and dogs reach maturity inside the space of months. Human babies, meanwhile, come into the world utterly helpless and remain dependent on their parents for many years. By plucking on our heartstrings, human babies are cleverly – if unknowingly – ensuring that they stay alive.']"
What can be done on an individual level about climate change and what difference would it make?,"On an individual level, people can take action to reduce their carbon footprint by making personal choices in their diet, travel, household energy use, consumption of goods and services, and family size[2]. Eating a mainly plant-based diet, avoiding frequent flying and petrol fuelled cars, having fewer children, using clothes and electrical products for longer, and electrifying homes are some of the high-impact actions that can be taken[2]. Participating in local and political advocacy around issues of climate change is also important, as well as joining groups advocating for collective action in the form of political solutions, such as carbon pricing, meat pricing, ending subsidies for fossil fuels and animal husbandry, and ending laws encouraging car use[3]. Individuals can also talk to people about climate change and open their minds to the issue[2][4]. Although individual action is essential, system-wide changes are also needed, like revamping our subsidy system for the energy and food industries, setting new rules and incentives for sectors like farming, deforestation and waste management[5].","['We spoke to our scientists at the Grantham Institute and drew up a list of the most achievable ways you personally can make a difference. While individuals alone may not be able to make drastic emissions cuts that limit climate change to acceptable levels, personal action is essential to raise the importance of issues to policymakers and businesses.', 'Individual action on climate change can include personal choices in many areas, such as diet, travel, household energy use, consumption of goods and services, and family size. Individuals can also engage in local and political advocacy around issues of climate change. People who wish to reduce their carbon footprint (particularly those in high income countries with high consumption lifestyles), can take ""high-impact"" actions, such as avoiding frequent flying and petrol fuelled cars, eating mainly a plant-based diet, having fewer children, using clothes and electrical products for longer, and electrifying homes. Avoiding meat and dairy foods has been called ""the single biggest way"" an individual can reduce their environmental impact. Excessive consumption is more to blame for climate change than population increase. High consumption lifestyles have a greater environmental impact, with the richest 10% of people emitting about half the total lifestyle emissions.', 'Others posit that individual citizen participation in groups advocating for collective action in the form of political solutions, such as carbon pricing, meat pricing, ending subsidies for fossil fuels and animal husbandry, and ending laws encouraging car use, is the most impactful way that an individual can take action to prevent climate change.', 'Since people often trust peers, family members and loved ones more than they trust experts, scientists and environmental organizations, you can talk to people about climate change in ways we can’t. You are more likely to open people’s minds.', 'Of course, it’s true that climate change won’t be solved by your buying or driving habits alone – although many experts agree these are important, and can influence others to make changes too (more on that later). Other changes are needed that can only be made on a bigger, system-wide basis – like revamping our subsidy system for the energy and food industries, which continue to reward fossil fuels, or setting new rules and incentives for sectors like farming, deforestation and waste management.']"
What causes an animal to recognize themselves in a mirror?,"The ability for animals to recognize themselves in a mirror is generally thought to be limited to humans, some great apes, dolphins, elephants, and magpies, due to their high intelligence. While some animals, such as pigs, have been observed spending roughly 20 minutes studying their own reflections in mirrors trying to figure it out[1], other animals, such as dogs, may quickly conclude that their mirror image is not of themselves or any other animal, because it lacks a corresponding scent[2]. In 2015, research suggested that some ants may be able to recognize themselves when looking in a mirror[2][5], but this has yet to be confirmed.","[""While Wilbur hasn't yet mastered the art of self-recognition through a mirror, pigs have shown a propensity for  using mirrors as a tool to locate hidden food. This indicates that they do realize they're seeing a reflection, though it's unclear if they can tell when they're looking at themselves. They've been observed spending roughly 20 minutes studying their own reflections in mirrors trying to figure it out."", 'For example, animals that rely on other senses more heavily than their vision may not take much interest in the sight of their reflections. Dogs, who recognize others mainly by their sense of smell, might quickly conclude that their mirror image is not of themselves or any other animal, because it lacks a corresponding scent. Furthermore, some animals may be able to recognize themselves in the mirror and see that they have been marked, but do not find the mark important enough to warrant touching or inspection.', 'But some researchers wonder whether failure is simply a sign that the exam itself is inadequate, perhaps because some animals can\'t understand how mirrors work.

That discrepancy puzzled Mu-ming Poo, a neurobiologist at the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences in China, and one of the study\'s authors. ""There must be some transition between that simple mirror use and recognizing yourself,"" he says.', 'But why? Other animals have a very different experience with mirrors than people do.

Why is dog racing so frowned upon but horse racing is praised worldwide?,"Dog racing is more frowned upon than horse racing because of its inhumane treatment of animals and its inability to reform.

Patrick Battuello is sure horse racing is headed for a similar demise. He said Americans no longer tolerate the mistreatment of animals for entertainment. “Ringling Brothers is gone. Multiple cities have banned rodeos.”']"
Why did medieval people write in such ridiculous scripts? Did gothic or other letters have any advantages I don't know about?,"Medieval people wrote in such elaborate scripts because they were more than just a way of writing. The scripts had religious, cultural and legal implications and could be used to date manuscripts. The Gothic and other scripts were associated with the Catholic Church, which popularized them for aesthetic reasons and to reflect their religious beliefs[2]. Additionally, the scripts were developed to achieve higher functionality, such as to prevent forgery[2][3]. Later on, scripts such as Anglicana and Secretary emerged to speed up the production of books for scholars and the noble or merchant classes[4]. In the Victorian period, enthusiasts for medieval culture even attempted to reproduce Gothic script using a pointed pen, which was an effortful exercise in self-conscious calligraphy[5].","['Similarly, distinctive are the fonts used by medieval scribes  to produce the elaborate manuscripts of the era. To the uninitiated they may look largely the same, but paleographers (historians who specialize in analyzing and dating ancient writing systems and manuscripts) have divided them into three main categories; Caroline, Pre-Gothic, and Gothic. Something as simple as identifying the style of writing used in a manuscript makes it possible to provide a reasonably accurate date, eliminating the need for expensive scientific tests on the velum it is written on which risks damaging the manuscript.', 'Beyond legal requirements, the Catholic Church also played a critical role in formalizing the rules of typography. They introduced design decisions that were supported by religious beliefs. To bring greater aesthetic appeal to formal scripture such as presentation bibles, the Textura or Gothic script was developed (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee). The Catholic Church popularized Textura/Gothic scripts because these letterforms borrowed inspiration from architecture and the tall strokes reflected the Christian desire to ascend to heaven (Drucker and Mcvarish 44). These new letterforms signaled the association of texts with different institutions as well as reflecting religious ideologies.', 'In contrast to the limited scripts of antiquity, countless innovative letterforms developed in Medieval times (Drucker and Mcvarish 35). While older typefaces were employed initially, new styles and forms were introduced to achieve higher functionality. For example, chancery scripts, which were “elaborately elongated handwriting used for official documents”, emanated out of the need to prevent forgery (Drucker and Mcvarish 41). In addition, to differentiate the handwriting of scholars from clerics, blackletter scripts such as Bastarda were employed in legal documents and correspondence (Drucker and Mcvarish 45).', 'As time passed, scribes became increasingly proficient in cursive scripts and letterforms matured further in the thirteenth-century (Harvard University English Department). Later on in Medieval times, book hand or court hand scripts such as Anglicana and Secretary emerged to speed up the production of books for scholars and the noble or merchant classes (University of Nottingham). These scripts migrated from places such as France to England in the fourteenth century, and they got “contaminated” or mutated and hybrid fonts such as Bastarda Anglicana (Anglicana with Textura features) and Bastarda Secretary (Secretary with Anglicana features) also surfaced (Reimer). Consequently, as literate cultures advanced, letterforms changed and greater emphasis was placed on typography.', 'Even while quills were still very much in use, during the Victorian period, we are treated to the remarkable sight of enthusiasts for medieval culture apparently trying to reproduce Gothic script using a pointed pen – a monumentally effortful exercise in self-conscious calligraphy and one which (in my opinion) was pretty much doomed.']"
why do Aquariums feed dugongs lettuce? Lettuce doesn’t grow underwater,"Aquariums feed dugongs lettuce because it is the closest match to the seagrass that they would eat in the wild[1]. Lettuce also helps with the nitrogen cycle, which is important for a healthy aquarium environment, as it consumes decomposition elements and waste[4]. Additionally, lettuce provides shade for small aquarium pets[3], and it propagates asexually in aquariums, meaning that it can reproduce quickly and easily[5].","['Pig is a BIG eater and feeds almost constantly from 7:30am to 7:00pm every day. In the wild, dugongs eat massive amounts of seagrass, and the closest match to that at SEA LIFE Sydney Aquarium is cos lettuce. Pig adores cos lettuce and eats about 30kg every day. The cos is washed and threaded into specially weighted racks, which sit on the bottom of the dugong display in Dugong Island, enabling Pig to graze as he would in the wild.', 'In Aquariums, you could use water lettuce to help the nitrogen cycle as it consumes decomposition elements. The Nitrogen cycle ensures the aquarium’s ecosystem is safe for fish to live. It’s common for beginners to miss this (known as new tank syndrome).', 'Just as water lettuce provides shade for your small aquarium pets, they need shade. If you’re growing the plant indoors, you can either use sunlight and put the tank near a window or use fluorescent grow light (T5 or T8 full-spectrum small bulbs).', 'Water lettuce will help clean your aquarium. It consumes uneaten fish food and waste such as Ammonia, Nitrites, and Nitrates, and so, it helps with the Nitrogen cycle, which we’ll talk about furthermore. That doesn’t mean that you should sit back and not change the tank’s water (Sorry!).', 'Water lettuce propagates both sexually and asexually, but in aquariums, it mainly propagates asexually, and you’ll find the small daughter plants it reproduces attached to the mother plant with a stolon. Don’t worry if their growth starts slow because it’ll increase in a few weeks.']"
"If it takes ~1000 gallons of water to produce a pound of beef, why is beef so cheap?","Beef is relatively cheap because of modern production practices that have improved husbandry practices and reduced overall water usage. For example, it takes only 441 gallons of water to produce one pound of boneless beef, compared to 2,500 gallons in the past[2]. Additionally, the global average water footprint to produce a pound of beef is 1,800 gallons, which is much lower than the 2,500 gallons previously estimated[3][4][5]. This is lower than the water footprints of other meats such as pork and soybeans, which further contributes to the relative affordability of beef.","['It takes approximately 1,847 gallons of water to produce 1 pound of beef — that’s enough water to fill 39 bathtubs all the way to the top.', 'The 2400 number may have been true 30 to 40 years ago, but modern beef production has improved significantly over time as better husbandry practices have actually reduced water usage. Today it takes 441 gallons of water to produce one pound of boneless beef.1', 'The number most often cited by plant based advocates is that it takes 2,500 gallons of water to produce a single pound of beef (although I have listened to people argue that number is as high as 12,000 gallons). A great starting point in deconstructing this myth is to investigate the orgin of this number and how it was calculated. Dr. Pimentel, a credible scientist and university professor calculated this number by assuming that a beef cow consumed 100 kilograms of hay and 4 kilograms of grain per pound of beef produced 1. He then took a generalized assumption that it takes 1,000 liters of water to grow 1kg of wheat and grain.', 'Whether industrial or pasture-raised, one pound of beef takes an average of 2,000 gallons of water to produce (though that water footprint is ""greener"" for pasture-raised cows because it incorporates the natural cycle of rainfall). To compare, Foodtank says that one pound of pork takes 718 gallons, while soybeans only take 206. These numbers show the resource-intensive state of the current beef supply system, which is only projected to grow along with the human population. But by acknowledging the amount of water the beef cattle industry consumes, we can begin to take sustainable steps forward.', 'Shock is reasonable after discovering that the global average water footprint – or the total amount of water needed – to produce one pound of beef is 1,800 gallons of water; one pound of pork takes 718 gallons of water. As a comparison, the water footprint of soybeans is 206 gallons; corn is 108 gallons.']"
"Electronic cigarettes, why are there so many different kinds, what are mods, what are atomisers/clearomisers/cartomisers and are they bad for you?","Electronic cigarettes come in many different types and sizes due to the variety of devices available. Mods are devices that are assembled from basic parts or modified from existing products[2]. Atomisers, clearomisers, and cartomisers are all types of vaping devices[1]. An atomiser is what turns the e-juice into a fine mist or vapor for inhalation[3]. Cartomisers are a combination of a juice cartridge and atomiser in one device[4], while clearomisers feature a transparent glass or plastic tank, a replaceable coil, a mouthpiece, and a chimney[1]. Electronic cigarettes work by heating up a liquid (e-juice) and turning it into vapor that is inhaled[4]. While there is still much research to be done on the safety of these devices, the general consensus is that they are better for you than traditional cigarettes.","['The most widely used vaping devices are clearomisers. Named for a blend of the words “clear” and “atomiser,” a clearomiser features a transparent glass or plastic tank, a replaceable coil, a mouthpiece, and a chimney. While any device that uses replaceable coils is indeed a clearomiser, the term is used primarily for mouth-to-lung tanks now. These tanks may include a special connection that allows them to be used with a range of vape mods.', 'There are three main types of e-cigarettes: cigalikes, looking like cigarettes; eGos, bigger than cigalikes with refillable liquid tanks; and mods, assembled from basic parts or by altering existing products. Cigalikes are either disposable or come with rechargeable batteries and replaceable nicotine cartridges. A cigalike e-cigarette contains a cartomizer, which is connected to a battery. A ""cartomizer"" (a portmanteau of cartridge and atomizer) or ""carto"" consists of an atomizer surrounded by a liquid-soaked poly-foam that acts as an e-liquid holder. Clearomizers or ""clearos"", not unlike cartotanks, use a clear tank in which an atomizer is inserted. A rebuildable atomizer or an RBA is an atomizer that allows users to assemble or ""build"" the wick and coil themselves instead of replacing them with off-the-shelf atomizer ""heads"". The power source is the biggest component of an e-cigarette, which is frequently a rechargeable lithium-ion battery.', '- 1 Atomizers: Atomizers are what turn the e-juice into a fine mist or vapor so that you can inhale it. Cartomizers and clearomizers are technically also atomizers, but when this term is used, vapers are usually referring to rebuildable models that require a bit of work.', 'The simplest version, and also the kind that most of the pen-style electronic cigarettes employ, is the cartomizer. It’s simply a juice cartridge and atomizer combined into one device. They can either be refilled with e-liquid, or you can even purchase disposable ones. The photo to the left is an example of a 510 cartomizer.', 'How an Electronic Cigarette works: There are many variations of electronic cigarettes ranging from simple devices that look like cigarettes, to larger “APV” devices, or “Advanced Personal Vaporizers”.

why do we find it unacceptable to kill criminals of all nature in our country but it's perfectly fine to kill people during war?,"Killing in war is often accepted rather than prohibited because it is seen as a necessary means of self-defense for a country under attack[2]. It is also generally excluded from criminal responsibility under the rubric of criminal law[3], as long as it is not performed in a degrading manner[1][2][4]. Furthermore, the legal concept of ""silent enim leges inter arma"" has become a widely accepted truism[5], which implies that laws are silent in times of war and killing is justified.[1][2][5]","['Without ignoring the fact that in all these areas modern international humanitarian law certainly has brought improvements, in particular by penalising and prosecuting war crimes, we are still far from having satisfactory solutions, neither on the international level of the laws of war nor on the national level of constitutional guarantees and criminal justifications and sanctions. Although I cannot here provide a complete solution, I will propose a first step. Instead of simply taking killing in war to be a matter of course, we should pose this question: why should killing in war—as long as it is not considered a war crime—be accepted rather than—as any homicide—prohibited?', 'In criticising the lack of a positive justification for killing in war, I am not so unworldly as to think that killing in war could not be justifiable in principle. On the contrary, in the same way as a private citizen has the right to resort to—if necessary, even deadly—self-defence against an unlawful attacker, a country under attack must have the same right, including the military personnel employed for its defence. However, it is necessary that licenses to kill are positively authorized and circumscribed in their requirements and limits.', 'Before being content with the common answer that it is simply the “law of war” that renders the justification, thus escaping the strict requirements of criminal law by simply jumping to the political softness of international law, it seems appropriate first to clarify whether and to what degree we might find grounds for excluding killing in war from criminal responsibility within the rubric of criminal law itself. To anticipate the answer, there is not much to expect from “classical” justifications in criminal law.Footnote 20', 'Consequently, any deadly military action induced by, and thus attributable to, the respective state—on whatever side—would be unlawful if it was to be considered a violation of human dignity and therefore irreconcilable with the Constitution. This seemingly total blocking of killing in war, however, is overcome by considering human dignity merely as the basis of the protection of life, whereas acknowledging that the exact extent of human dignity would need to be determined according to the life’s guarantee in Art. 2(2), sentence 1, of the German Basic Law.Footnote 31 Furthermore, killing as such shall not be considered a violation of dignity as long as it is not performed in a degrading manner.Footnote 32 Since a degrading manner can only be assumed if the killing amounts to a war crime, human dignity appears not to be touched by “normal” military fatalities.', 'Silent enim leges inter arma. With this phrase, Marcus Tullius Cicero defended the People’s tribune Milo’s killing of his adversary Clodius in 52 B.C.Footnote 1 Over time this defence has become so commonly recognised that Thomas Hobbes described it as “a fond saying, that all laws are silent in the time of war.”Footnote 2 Since it has evolved into a frequently quoted truism, it may be a Don Quixote fight against windmills to call the legitimacy of killing in war into question. It seems particularly so when considering that in the meantime warfare has been domesticated by modern humanitarian international law and opened to prosecution when crossing the threshold of a war crime. So, why shouldn’t this be sufficient to find killing in war both morally justified and sufficiently legitimised? Why cast doubt on it?']"
Would a vegetarian man's feces make good compost?,"Yes, a vegetarian man's feces could make good compost. Human waste is normally not recommended for the general home compost bin, but it can be properly managed and composted in a composting toilet[3]. Animal waste such as manure is a key component of nutritious compost, as it adds nutrients, increases microbial activity and speeds up the composting process[5]. As long as the vegetarian man's diet is not too rich and contains enough nutrients, the excreta would be suitable for composting.","['The reuse of feces as fertilizer was common in Japan. In the city of Edo, compost merchants gathered feces to sell to farmers. That was good additional income for apartment owners. Human excreta of rich people were sold at higher prices because their diet was better; presumably, more nutrients remained in their excreta. Various historic documents dating from the 9th century detail the disposal procedures for toilet waste.', 'These risks are reduced by proper fecal sludge management, e.g. via composting. The safe reduction of human excreta into compost is possible. Some municipalities create compost from the sewage sludge, but then recommend that it only be used on flower beds, not vegetable gardens. Some claim[who?] that this is dangerous or inappropriate without the expensive removal of heavy metals.', 'Human waste is normally a “no” for the general home compost bin. However, if properly managed, human waste can be properly composted. A composting toilet can turn your poop and other organic material into compost that is just about ready to use.', 'Cat feces, is really a big no. While it can be professionally composted, it is a very long and complicated process that is not necessarily worth the risk for the homeowner. Cats excrete toxoplasma eggs in their poop, which causes toxoplasmosis in humans; and the reason why pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems are told not to clean the litter box.', 'Compost, the key ingredient to our Soil Building plan, is rich in organic matter that breaks down over time. Scraps of vegetative foods, shredded paper, grass clippings, weeds, expired garden plants, eggshells, and poop, make their way into our own homemade blend of liquid compost. Wait, back up; did you say poop? That’s right, certain types of animal waste, or manure, are key components of nutritious compost. Manure adds nutrients, increases microbial activity, and speeds up the composting process.']"
What is the evolutionary purpose of aging?,"The evolutionary purpose of aging is to maximize fitness and to build vehicles for successful reproduction[3]. Aging is associated with selective processes and is the result of a genetic program[1][3]. It is thought of as being intractable to experimental analysis or medical intervention[4], but is believed to be derived from the ideas proposed by Medawar in which genetic drift and mutation accumulation lead to the loss of late-acting beneficial genes or to the appearance of late-acting harmful genes, or from Williams's model, in which aging evolves due to the pleiotropic effect of some genes that are beneficial early in life and then harmful at later ages[5].","['The ""why"" theories are predicated on the premise that creatures are genetically programmed for a relatively short lifespan even when they are capable of aiming for immortality (DNA as self-replicators have eternal life). Based on these hypotheses, aging, programmed into genes as the result of a long evolutionary process, defies any easy intervention by human beings. Why is it that almost all living things weaken and die with age? Aging is the product of natural selection. Organisms allocate resources to reproduction, rather than the maintenance of the body, because living things function biologically as a means of maintaining the existence DNA. If this is true, aging is not an avoidable property of life. Instead, it is the result of a genetic program.', '""Because aging increases an organism\'s vulnerability and ultimately leads to its death, as detailed before, it is apparently in contradiction with Darwin\'s evolutionary theory. After all, how could evolution favor a process that, as happens in most animals, gradually increases mortality and decreases reproductive capacity? How could genes that cause aging evolve? This essay presents and discusses the most important evolutionary models for how aging may have evolved.', ""Evolutionary theories of ageing have been extensively reviewed [1,2,5,6] and are only briefly summarized here. These theories rely on the axiom that selection maximizes fitness, not necessarily lifespan. Therefore, ageing is associated with selective processes to build vehicles for successful reproduction [7,8]. The key idea underpinning the evolutionary theory of ageing is that the strength of natural selection on a trait declines after sexual maturation and with advancing age [9–13] resulting in Haldane's  famous ‘selection shadow’ (figure 1). This is because non-ageing-related extrinsic mortality reduces the probability of late-life reproduction and old individuals in the population have already produced a large part of their lifetime reproduction and passed on their genes resulting in a decline in selection gradients on mortality and fertility [11–13,17]. This single, fundamentally important insight led to the formulation of the major theories of ageing."", '- Everything we know about the evolution of aging tells us that it is not a programmed process, so it has often been thought of as being intractable to experimental analysis or medical intervention. But evolutionarily conserved high-level regulators of phenotypic plasticity have turned out to be able to produce a major rearrangement of physiology and to ameliorate the effects of aging.', ""Therefore, the evolutionary theory of aging proposes two models for how aging can evolve. One derives from Medawar's ideas in which genetic drift and mutation accumulation lead to the loss of late-acting beneficial genes or to the appearance of late-acting harmful genes. In Williams's model, aging evolves due to the pleiotropic effect of some genes that are beneficial early in life and then harmful at later ages. At present, both theories are widely accepted and they are not mutually exclusive (Gavrilov and Gavrilova, 2002). Some results conducted in Drosophila, a fruit fly widely used in aging studies, hint that Medawar's theory of mutation accumulation might be more prevalent over Williams's antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis (Charlesworth and Hughes, 1996; Hughes et al., 2002), but conflicting results exit (Rose et al., 2002).""]"
Why is _URL_0_ bad for the internet? And how is it related to the net neutrality debate?,"Opponents of net neutrality argue that it reduces investment and deters competition, increases taxes and imposes unnecessary regulations, prevents the Internet from being accessible to poor people, prevents Internet traffic from being allocated to the most needed users, and that large Internet providers already have a performance advantage over smaller providers[3]. Additionally, net neutrality regulations could prevent service providers from providing more affordable Internet access to those who can't afford it, such as by providing free or reduced cost internet access through subsidies or advertising[4]. This could stifle competition and give larger companies an advantage since they have the means to fund faster Internet speeds[1]. Net neutrality rules would also prevent ISPs from discriminating traffic, forcing low-income users to pay for high-bandwidth usage like other users[4]. Finally, without new regulations, Internet service providers would be able to profit from and favor their own private protocols over others, giving larger companies an advantage over smaller, up-and-coming businesses[5].","['Pro-net neutrality arguments have also noted that regulations are necessary due to research showing low tolerance to slow-loading content providers. In a 2009 research study conducted by Forrester Research, online shoppers expected the web pages they visited to download content instantly. When a page fails to load at the expected speed, many of them simply click out. A study found that even a one-second delay could lead to ""11% fewer page views, a 16% decrease in customer satisfaction, and 7% loss in conversions."" This delay can cause a severe problem to small innovators who have created new technology. If a website is slow by default, the general public will lose interest and favor a website that runs faster. This helps large corporate companies maintain power because they have the means to fund faster Internet speeds. On the other hand, smaller competitors have less financial capabilities making it harder for them to succeed in the online world.', 'Those in favor of forms of non-neutral tiered Internet access argue that the Internet is already not a level playing field, and that large companies achieve a performance advantage over smaller competitors by providing more and better-quality servers and buying high-bandwidth services. Should scrapping of net neutrality regulations precipitate a price drop for lower levels of access, or access to only certain protocols, for instance, such would make Internet usage more adaptable to the needs of those individuals and corporations who specifically seek differentiated tiers of service. Network expert Richard Bennett has written, ""A richly funded Web site, which delivers data faster than its competitors to the front porches of the Internet service providers, wants it delivered the rest of the way on an equal basis. This system, which Google calls broadband neutrality, actually preserves a more fundamental inequality.""', 'Supporters of net neutrality argue that it prevents cable companies from filtering Internet content without a court order, fosters freedom of speech and democratic participation, promotes competition and innovation, prevents dubious services, maintains the end-to-end principle, and that users would be intolerant of slow-loading websites. Opponents of net neutrality argue that it reduces investment, deters competition, increases taxes, imposes unnecessary regulations, prevents the Internet from being accessible to poor people, prevents Internet traffic from being allocated to the most needed users, that large Internet providers already have a performance advantage over smaller providers, and that there is already significant competition among Internet providers with few competitive issues.', ""Opponents argue that net neutrality regulations prevent service providers from providing more affordable Internet access to those who can't afford it. A concept known as zero-rating, ISPs would be unable to provide Internet access for free or at a reduced cost to the poor under net neutrality rules. For example, low-income users who can't afford bandwidth-hogging Internet services such as video streams could be exempted from paying through subsidies or advertising. However, under the rules, ISPs would not be able to discriminate traffic, thus forcing low-income users to pay for high-bandwidth usage like other users."", 'Proponents of net neutrality argue that without new regulations, Internet service providers would be able to profit from and favor their own private protocols over others. The argument for net neutrality is that ISPs would be able to pick and choose who they offer a greater bandwidth to. If one website or company is able to afford more, they will go with them.

How fish can produce light while being at the very bottom of the ocean,"Bioluminescence is an amazing process that some creatures in the depths of the ocean, such as ascidians, sharks, stingrays, and jellyfish, are capable of producing light without changing their body temperature[1]. This phenomenon has evolved independently in ray-finned fishes 27 times[2], and up to 80 percent of them living in the open water produce their own light[2][4]. This includes the anglerfish, a member of the clade Lophiiformes, which has bacteria living on its forehead that emits light[3][4]. This light is often used to lure prey or as a form of camouflage against predators[5].","['The depths of the oceans, especially, are where what we see leave us amazed. From microscopic bacteria to giant squids, and from tiny lighted jellyfish to spiny skin, many creatures, from ascidians to some sharks and stingrays, turn on their lights, literally, illuminating the darkness of the deep sea. This biological light-producing process in the body of some animals is called bioluminescence. It is astounding that these creatures can emit biological light with no change in their body temperature. Normally, light is formed by emitting heat. This basic principle applies to some of the most common sources of light that we know of, such as campfires and electrical lightbulbs.', 'But while scientists knew that many fishes are bioluminescent, they could only guess at just how common light production is among those animals. Now, new research reveals surprising results: up to 80 percent of ray-finned fishes living in the open water—from deep-sea-dwelling anglerfish to coral-reef-residing flashlight fish—make their own light. What’s more, the phenomenon has evolved independently in that group 27 times. As the researchers report in PLOS ONE, this unexpectedly high prevalence implies that, for fishes, producing their own light is more than just a neat trick—it must also come with significant advantages.', 'Imagine descending into the ocean’s depths in a submarine. At first, you are in a bright underwater world, full of fish, marine mammals, plankton, and coral reefs. This is called the epipelagic zone. As you move deeper into this alien universe and approach the depth of 200 meters, your surroundings become dark rapidly, and you can barely make out the shapes of organisms. You are now in the mesopelagic zone, the twilight zone. Below 1000 meters (bathypelagic zone), the underwater world outside your submarine window becomes completely dark. To reach the bottom of the ocean, however, you would still have to descend about four times as deep as you are now! Moving deeper into the blackness, you see a tiny light in the inky depths (abyssopelagic zone). What illuminates the ocean where sunlight can’t penetrate? An animal that makes its own light — the anglerfish, a member of the clade Lophiiformes (LAH-fee-uh-FOR-meez)!', 'The angler fish is one of the most iconic fish of the deep ocean due to its famous rod and bioluminescence. The angler fish does not actually produce its light on its own: the light is credited to bioluminescent symbiotic bacteria that inhabit the end of the rod on their forehead. This illuminated part, which resembles a worm-like bait, is very attractive to small fish. These fish are thus lured to the angler expecting a quick snack, but instead the angler swallows them whole with its massive mouth. While doing their task of helping the angler hunt small fish, the bacteria maintain a symbiotic relationship with the fish and also find an environment in which to proliferate. In this way, they form a good example of cooperation and solidarity. One may wonder: how can such a mutual agreement come into fruition between a fish and some bacteria which are deprived of a nervous system, mind, and consciousness?', 'Bioluminescent systems were also given to creatures in order to act as a means of camouflage. They work phenomenally for both hunting and survival in situations where blending in with the environment is paramount for catching prey or evading predators. In the depths of the underwater world, the silhouette of an animal bathing in light is an easily recognizable target. One of the best examples of this phenomenon is the deep-sea hatchetfish. The fish has been created with its eyes on top of its body and its mouth facing upwards, making it easier to hunt. It also emits bioluminescence from its abdomen to provide camouflage against more aggressive, larger fish that swim lower than itself. The color of the light emitted makes it difficult to recognize the fish from below as it perfectly matches the color intensity of the environment. In the meantime, if the sunlight that hits the sea is interrupted in any way, the fish will turn off its lights and the camouflage will continue.']"
Psychologists. Why do we humans really enjoy the sensation of loud music and why is it more enjoyable loud?,"There are several reasons why humans enjoy the sensation of loud music. One is that loud music can cause an emotional response via seven general mechanisms and their interactions[1]. Another is that the physiological response to loudness may be similar across different pieces of music, and could provide a positive experience for people who experience loud sound while having fun[2]. Additionally, loud music can interact with other aspects of our sensory systems, such as the balance organs, and can influence our perception of time[4]. Lastly, loud sound may also be linked to a culture of loud music where people expect loud music as part of entertainment[2][3][5].","['Much of the high-level sound exposure during leisure time in Western societies involves music, and some of the theory about why music produces emotional responses may be relevant to the question of why people enjoy loudness. It has been suggested that music can cause an emotional response via seven more general mechanisms and their interactions 7 :', 'Because the physiological response to loudness would be similar across different pieces of music, the sound level itself provides a positive experience for people who experience loud sound while having fun (e.g., regular clubbers). There may be multiple conditioning processes occurring at different times or simultaneously and relating to the different reasons for liking loud music: for example, excitement/arousal, social bonding, intimacy, masking unwanted thoughts and sounds, and the feeling of being cool and tough may all act as “unconditioned” stimuli. Furthermore, in an environment such as a nightclub, there would be other co-occurring unconditioned stimuli that are not directly related to the sound; for example, alcohol and drug consumption, sexual attraction, or being among friends. The pairing of these stimuli with loudness may explain the apparent maladaptive dependency on loud music displayed by some people. 46', 'With a view to answer these questions, this special Research Topic on “The Influence of Loud Music on Physical and Mental Health” has been launched. Contributions have been solicited from leading authors in the fields of acoustics, psychoacoustics, audiology, sensory biology, neurosciences, psychology, and sociology with the aim to provide a view of the state of the art about the effects of loud music on human beings. In order to provide a broader overview, care has been taken not to focus exclusively on possible harmful effects, but also to investigate the underlying mechanisms that bring people to risky listening behaviors, even when they know that loud music may be harmful for their auditory system and their wellbeing in general.', 'Music influences our bodies and emotions, making us relaxed, aroused, or excited. This is supported by the idea that loud sounds interact with other aspects of our sensory systems: our balance organs may be stimulated by sound at frequencies 100 to 300 Hz at levels >90 A-weighted decibels such as is normal for nightclub music, leading to a desire to move with the music. 18 The perception of loudness may be influenced by other senses (e.g., touch), 32 and loud sounds may influence our perception of time, causing it to pass more slowly. 33', 'Simplified Conditioning, Adaptation, and Acculturation to Loud Music model diagram showing the three parallel cycles that may lead to people enjoying loud sound.

How do birds know not to fly in the path of a kite and its strings?,"Birds know not to fly in the path of a kite and its strings due to the danger posed by the strong special string which is made by applying glass powder on it (known as Manjha) that can cause entanglement, mutilation of wings and nerve injuries, and even death[5]. To minimize the risk, kite fliers must use plain, cotton threads with no coating[2]. People should also practice kite flying in open ground and avoid the morning and evening times when birds are generally active, and avoid flying kites near nesting areas of birds[2]. When kites are abandoned or get stuck in trees, birds can get their feet caught up in the strings, which can cause them to lose their entire foot[4].","['During the kite-flying season, kites often cut off in the sky and fall on trees, shrubs, or electrical lines. Birds that use these areas for perching get entangled in the manjha, struggling to escape. The thread gets enmeshed in their wings, feathers, and claws, and if left unattended, they die in a matter of time.', 'To minimise the risk, kite fliers must use plain, cotton threads with no coating. If one comes across strings entangled in trees, carefully dispose them off. People should practice kite flying in open ground and avoid the morning and evening times when birds are generally active. If one is aware of nesting areas of birds, avoid flying kites near them. Such measures will ensure a minimised danger and risk to the bird populations.', 'Wildlife SOS, a conservation organisation, received two calls to rescue birds injured by kites in Delhi in the week before Sankranti this year. When the organisation receives these calls, they bring the birds to their hospitals.“The bird does get injured if something obstructs its path,” said Akram. Plain cotton strings, which are legal, can disorient birds and make them fall from great heights, he added. “Birds are fragile.”', 'Injuries don’t just happen when the kites are up in the air. When kites are abandoned or get stuck in trees, birds can get their feet caught up in the strings. In some cases, they lose their entire foot. “The birds can still fly, so we’re not able to catch them [to help them],” said Akram. “We can only watch them suffer.”', 'Kites flown these days are known to use a strong special string which is made by applying glass powder on it (known as Manjha) to provide it a cutting edge. This practice of using an abrasive thread for kite fighting has posed a great threat to species including birds, fruit-bats, macaques and even humans. The impact on birds however is much larger. Birds when in flight, fail to notice the fine glass-coated thread, get entangled and injured even causing fractures, mutilation of wings and nerve injuries. At times, the minute glass pieces used in manjha get embedded in their bodies adding to the misery and eventual death. Additionally, these strings unlike their cotton counterpart do not lose its strength even after getting wet and hence stays for a long time in the environment, creating potential threat for the birds both local and migratory. With more kites competing for space with birds, the number of injuries has risen over the years.']"
What is the difference between how conservationists treat species that are endangered due to human activity and those that are endangered due to natural factors. Are there even any species that are endangered by a factor other than human activity?,"Conservationists treat species that are endangered due to human activity differently than those that are endangered due to natural factors. For species endangered due to human activity, governments and international organizations work to protect them by enacting laws that limit hunting and destruction of the species’ habitat. Individuals and organizations that break these laws may face huge fines. For species endangered due to natural factors, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) keeps a “Red List of Threatened Species” that has seven levels of conservation and defines the severity and specific causes of a species’ threat of extinction[2]. According to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), species may be listed as either endangered or threatened depending on their population decline[5]. There are species that are endangered by a factor other than human activity, such as deforestation, excessive usage of fossil fuels, and phytoplankton extinctions leading to global warming effects[3].","['When a species is classified as endangered, governments and international organizations can work to protect it.

How do companies afford to give away their products for free?,"Companies can afford to give away their products for free in a variety of ways. One is through the use of loss leaders, where they offer something free to get customers in the door, and the customers end up buying something else while they're there[1]. Companies can also give out free samples when introducing a new product to the market[2]. Additionally, companies may give away free products to people who express how much they enjoy using their products and are fans of their creations[2][3]. Giving away freebies can also be an effective form of word-of-mouth marketing, as research has found that people who get a product for free talk about it more than those who don't[4].

Once there, the array of spices with their enticing aromas tempts people to purchase more. The makeup counter at a department store may offer a free sample of a new lotion, but while you’re picking it up, the counter clerk will also show you the new lipstick and eye makeup. Enough people buy these other products that the giveaway is worthwhile.', '1. When companies introduce a new product to the market, whether it’s a perfume or a pizza, they often give away free samples. They hand out product to consumers and send free coupons in the mail. They offer free coupons to people who “like” the product on Facebook. While people may be hesitant to try something new if they have to pay for it -- if they’re disappointed, they’ll have wasted their money -- many people will try anything once if it’s free. If the product is good, they’ll want another pizza or more perfume. Even when the product is no longer free, they’ll come back to buy it. With this kind of giveaway, companies target likely purchasers. They give away free product to people who are already in grocery stores shopping or the restaurant eating, or to people who page through Sunday coupon circulars. They already know these people buy similar products, making them likely candidates to like the new product.', 'I recently encountered the $39 dollar experiment conducted by Tom Locke. In this experiment, he wrote to 100 companies asking them for free products.

He received many items and products from a variety of companies. I was impressed. I wanted to try this out for myself.', 'You’ll talk more about freebies. The rise of social media has more companies concerned with “word of mouth” marketing and reputation. Getting your customers to say nice things about you is, according to some research, as effective as traditional advertising, and it’s almost always cheaper. And companies like Procter & Gamble are figuring that one of the easiest and best ways to get people talking about their products is to simply give them away. An article in the Journal of Marketing found that people who got a product for free talked about it 20% more. Getting a freebie related to the product prompted them to talk about it 15% more, while coupons and rebates didn’t make a difference.', 'People love the idea of getting something for nothing. Marketers are using this love of anything free to spread the word about products, find new customers and increase sales.

where does energy 'go' when it is used by a living thing?,"Energy is used by living things to do work and is ultimately sourced from the sun[1][3].

Food webs show how energy moves throughout a system[5], and with each step, the energy that was originally emitted by the Sun is consumed, but that energy also dissipates with each step[5].","[""All living things require energy to do the work necessary for survival and reproduction. This is true for bacteria, plants, and animals. But what is energy? Energy is simply the ability to do work, where work is done when a force moves an object. Let's consider your own needs for a moment. You need energy to turn on and turn off your computer. You need energy to get out of bed in the morning. You even need energy to listen to this lesson and think about what it says. And, yes, you need energy to reproduce. So where does energy come from and how do we use it? On Earth, energy ultimately comes from the sun. Plants use the sun's energy to make sugar. Organisms, in turn, use sugar as a source of energy to do work."", 'In the scientific world, energy is defined as the ability to do work. You can often see energy at work in living things — a bird flies through the air, a firefly glows in the dark, a dog wags its tail.

Energy is required to break down and build up molecules, and to transport many molecules across plasma membranes. All of life’s work needs energy. A lot of energy is also simply lost to the environment as heat. The story of life is a story of energy flow — its capture, its change of form, its use for work, and its loss as heat. Energy (unlike matter) cannot be recycled, so organisms require a constant input of energy. Life runs on chemical energy. Where do living organisms get this chemical energy?', 'Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\): Most energy comes from the sun, either directly or indirectly: Most life forms on earth get their energy from the sun.

How do they get such incredible shots of animals in documentaries?,"Documentary filmmakers use a variety of methods to get incredible shots of animals. They use infrared beams to detect motion and capture shots of rare animals, and they can also film animals in enclosed habitats. They also use gyro-stabilized cameras with powerful zoom lenses, mounted on helicopters and jeeps, to get close but undisturbed shots of animals from a distance[3]. In some cases, filmmakers may even rent animals from game farms for easier filming[2]. Additionally, filmmakers can fabricate drama by remixing footage and adding foreboding music[4]. However, film-makers should be careful not to hoodwink the audience by making an animal do something it would not otherwise be doing[5].","['Now, camera operators use infrared beams to detect motion and capture shots of the rarest animals, such as Arabian leopards from Oman or colourless tigers in Eastern Russia. For the latter, says Fothergill, the team laid out 40 such cameras. They saw no tigers for an entire year. “It was only the second year that we started seeing their footprints in the snow and, using remote-controlled cameras, we managed to capture an entire sequence. It looks as if it’s been shot by a cameraman, but it was the cameras.” The cameras were luckier than the camera operators, who lived in custom-built hives for two winters – “pooed, ate, everything in these hives,” Fothergill says – and managed to film nothing.', 'Sometimes the terrifying predators shown onscreen have, in fact, been rented from game farms for easier filming. Doug Allan, a documentarian known for his skillful shots of arctic animals, disclosed some wildlife documentary trickery in his 2012 book Freeze Frame. Many times, Allan explained, small animals are filmed on enclosed ""habitats"" -- including nearly every shot in the BBC\'s ""Hidden Kingdoms"" documentary. ""There\'s massive skill in set filming,"" Allan told the Guardian, ""but it\'s not the one that I have.""', '“Every year there are new technologies that comes along; in this series there are three,” says producer Alastair Fothergill. He then proceeds to describe at least five. In Planet Earth, he says, the team achieved visual breakthroughs by attaching a specially-developed gyro-stabilized camera with an extremely powerful zoom lens to a helicopter. This let them film animals from the sky, without disturbance and without camera shake. In Our Planet, the team has mounted these same cameras on new vehicles: in one sequence, the camera slides smoothly alongside a pack of running prairie dogs. This sequence was filmed not from a helicopter but from a jeep, as it raced over land filled with potholes and anthills. “You seem to be running with the dogs,” says Fothergill. “You could never film that with a traditional tripod: every shot is moving, because all of it is shot with a very powerful lens from quite a long way away, about 100 metres from the action.”', 'It\'s no secret that more dramatic wildlife footage gets higher ratings. Animals hunting, charging and attacking are the shots producers crave -- so much that they sometimes fabricate the drama. ""Wild America,"" for example, allegedly portrayed a playful scene between a tame cougar and its handler as a ferocious attack. Producers on series like ""Yukon Men,"" ""Shark Week,"" ""Swamp People,"" and others can easily remix footage and add foreboding music to craft entertaining -- yet only partially accurate -- shows, Adam Welz argues for the Guardian.', 'Mr Dohrn, who has filmed many different forms of wildlife over his 30-year career, says film-makers cross a line when they hoodwink the audience by making an animal do something it would not otherwise be doing.']"
The Hunter-gatherer/'Paleo' diet.,"The 'Paleo' or Hunter-Gatherer diet is based on the eating habits of our ancestors in the Paleolithic period, between 2.5 million and 10,000 years ago[1][3]. It focuses on lean meat, fruits, vegetables, nuts, fish, and seeds[5], and forbids foods of agricultural societies, such as corn, wheat, rice, dairy products, legumes, and refined sugar[5]. However, it is important to note that this diet is based on privilege and not logic, as hunter-gatherers in the Paleolithic hunted and gathered because they had to, while Paleo dieters attempt to eat like hunter–gatherers because they want to[2].

Why wouldn't a drag queen shave off xir facial hair?

And I won\'t lie—the main reason I keep my beard it is because I like the way it looks day to day. It\'s irritating to constantly shave it off and grow it back. I really feel that my drag looks better with it, like I\'m not a huge fan of my jaw line, and I like the extra pop of colour I get from the beard.

"How come colorful animals usually mean they are deadly, and most animals keep away from them except humans?","Bright colors and patterns in animals are a form of warning coloration, also known as aposematism, which is used to signal to predators that the animal is dangerous or poisonous[1][2]. It is thought that these bright colors evolved over time as a way for animals to survive and pass on their genetic material to future generations[3]. Most animals, excluding humans, are aware of this warning coloration and will stay away from the animals that display it, as they know that they may be hurt or poisoned by coming into contact with them.","['Warning coloration, in which animals display bold patterns or colors to ward off predators, is an opposite strategy to camouflage. Lots of animals make use of this tactic, from butterflies to frogs to honey badgers—basically, pretty much anything that has venom, spines, stingers, foul scents, or strong bites, or is toxic. Bees, for example, have bright and distinctive yellow and black stripes to alert predators that they have stingers. Poison dart frogs have a wide range of brilliant colors and patterns that let predators—including humans—know that if we eat them, their poison could kill us. But until recently, it was unclear how mammals fit into this equation.', 'Chemical deterrents can be used before or after a predator’s attack. Poisons, along with repellants, are effective. They can favor the evolution of aposematic coloration, in which a brightly colored, easy-to-remember appearance, when combined with the disastrous experience of tangling with such a noxious prey, causes predators to avoid an animal with that appearance in the future. Aposematism (Greek, apo = away, sematic = sign) is the use of warning coloration to inform potential predators that an animal is poisonous, venomous, or otherwise dangerous. Oftentimes orange or red patterns may be warnings (as in coral snakes), but do not assume that red is always a warning (see Chapter 7). Examples of warning colors and patterns are shown in Figure 10.16.', ""According to the researchers' analysis, most of the ancestors of the animals they studied started out rather plain and drab, evolving their vivid hues over time, and most of them live in environments in which their vivid colors stand out. The most reasonable explanation is that more brightly colored animals were better able to survive, and pass their genetic material onto generations that continued the trend."", 'It has been known for over a century that insects that are distasteful or toxic tend also to be brightly colored. This phenomenon, called “warning coloration” or “aposematism,” is thought to be an instance of interspecific communication, whereby the bright pattern signals to the predator that the prey is noxious (for references see Schuler and Roper, 1992).', 'Aposematism (Greek, apo = away, sematic = sign) is the use of warning coloration to inform potential predators that an animal is poisonous, venomous, or otherwise dangerous.']"
"Why can't the bad stuff in old meats (chicken, beef, pork) just be cooked?","The bad stuff in old meats (chicken, beef, pork) cannot just be cooked because it is not always caused by the passage of time since butchering, but by the environment in which the meat is stored, such as the right levels of moisture and low temperatures, which creates favorable conditions for spoilage bacteria[4]. Spoiled meat can have a distinct sour odor, taste funny, and will look dull with white patches due to freezer burn[4][5]. Cooked meats can last longer in the refrigerator than raw meat in the freezer but should be used within a few weeks to two months of freezing[5].","[""What this means for you as a consumer is that you shouldn't dismiss or toss meat just because it doesn't look store display-bright anymore.

This is due to the growth of microorganisms such as yeast, mold, and spoilage bacteria, the latter of which triggers deterioration of the meat and can make it taste very seriously ""funny."" This is not necessarily caused by time since butchering, but again, packaging that makes the environment overly friendly for this type of growth. The more favorable conditions for spoilage bacteria—like the right levels of moisture and low temperatures—the faster it grows and the sooner your meat rots.', ""Cooked meats, like fajita strips or chicken tenders and burgers will remain in good shape for longer in the refrigerator—for five to eight days—but surprisingly, not quite as long as raw meat in the freezer.

How can artists get sued when their song is similar to another song but parodies are legal.,"Musicians can get sued for copyright infringement if their song is similar to another song and they do not have permission from the copyright owner. Although parodies are legal, it does not mean that a musician is free from legal action. Parodists may still be liable for copyright infringement if they copy any element from the original song, such as the musical notes of a composition[2]. Also, when parodies have a commercial benefit for the creators, they can be denounced as attempts to piggyback off of the work and success of the original artist[3]. In order to avoid legal action, parodists may need to rely on the fair use defense to show that their work is a valid parody[4]. However, the safest way to avoid copyright infringement is to get permission from the rightsholder[2][4][5].","['Using more than just a ""sample,"" creating a parody song that winds up in the Supreme Court, and subconsciously copying someone else\'s work can land a musician in years of legal battles. Not to mention the argument of where inspiration ends and straight-up plagiarism begins.', 'Remember that many parodies will be composite works. For example a commercial music video consists of a music recording, composition, lyrics, performance and cinematographic video. Copying even one of these elements can constitute infringement, meaning that it does not comply with copyright law. A completely new video recording may be removed from YouTube if it contains clips from a music track belonging to a rightsholder who objects to the use. By avoiding direct copying of a sound or video recording, parodists can avoid having their work removed from services like YouTube, even though the indirectly copied elements (such as musical notes of a composition) may still be infringing.', 'There are some things that musicians do which are clearly not fair use, such as providing friends with copies of sheet music or recordings, since such copying and sharing means that the copyright owners will sell fewer copies of their music. But what about parody? The freedom to make social commentary through parody creates lots of grey area where copyright law is concerned. Shows such as Saturday Night Live and late-night talk shows constantly parody the work of artists, but when parodies have a commercial benefit for the creators, they are often denounced as attempts to piggyback off of the work and success of the original artist.', 'Since copyright law prohibits the substantial use of a copyrighted work without permission of the copyright owner, and because such permission is highly unlikely when the use is to create a parody, it may be necessary for the parodist to rely on the fair-use defense to forestall any liability for copyright infringement. However, the fair-use defense if successful will only be successful when the newly created work that purports itself to be parody is a valid parody.', 'A parody will not infringe copyright if the parodist has secured the permission of the rightsholder. Note that the author or artist is not always the rightsholder – it may be a publishing company or a music label. Seeking permission from these entities can be a costly and time-consuming process, and this may discourage small-scale parodists. However, with permission secured, you are free to parody the work within the bounds of the agreed licence, without risk of infringement.']"
why would anyone deny climate change,"Climate change denial is the refusal to accept the scientific consensus on climate change, including the extent to which it is caused by humans, its effects on nature and human society, or the potential of adapting to global warming by human actions[2]. It can also be implicit when individuals or social groups accept the science but fail to come to terms with it or to translate their acceptance into action[2]. Common arguments used by climate change deniers include that climate change is part of the natural cycle, that climate models are unreliable and too sensitive to carbon dioxide[5], or that the science of climate change is not settled[1][2][3][4][5].","['Scientists say climate change denial is now more likely to focus on the causes and effects of warming, or how to tackle it, than to outright deny it exists.', 'Climate change denial, or global warming denial, is denial, dismissal, or doubt that contradicts the scientific consensus on climate change, including the extent to which it is caused by humans, its effects on nature and human society, or the potential of adaptation to global warming by human actions. Many who deny, dismiss, or hold doubt about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming self-label as ""climate change skeptics"", which several scientists have noted is an inaccurate description. Climate change denial can also be implicit when individuals or social groups accept the science but fail to come to terms with it or to translate their acceptance into action. Several social science studies have analyzed these positions as forms of denial or denialism, pseudoscience, or propaganda.', 'The National Center for Science Education describes climate change denial as disputing differing points in the scientific consensus, a sequential range of arguments from denying the occurrence of climate change, accepting that but denying any significant human contribution, accepting these but denying scientific findings on how this would affect nature and human society, to accepting all these but denying that humans can mitigate or reduce the problems. James L. Powell provides a more extended list, as does climatologist Michael E. Mann in ""six stages of denial"", a ladder model whereby deniers have over time conceded acceptance of points, while retreating to a position which still rejects the mainstream consensus:', '34. ^ a b National Center for Science Education 2012: ""There is debate ... about how to refer to the positions that reject, and to the people who doubt or deny, the scientific community\'s consensus on ... climate change. Many such people prefer to call themselves skeptics and describe their position as climate change skepticism. Their opponents, however, often prefer to call such people climate change deniers and to describe their position as climate change denial ... \'Denial\' is the term preferred even by many deniers.""', 'This is the type of denial we are all familiar with: that the science of climate change is not settled. Deniers suggest climate change is just part of the natural cycle. Or that climate models are unreliable and too sensitive to carbon dioxide.']"
Do animals have understanding of death?,"There is still much debate on whether animals have an understanding of death. Some academics may not believe that animals can understand the concept of death, as there hasn't been much evidence that nonhuman animals can represent abstract, unobservable constructs[2]. However, some believe that great apes and also monkeys show compassionate care for the dying, but whether they have an understanding of death is uncertain[3]. Others suggest that an outright assumption that animals can't have even a minimum concept of death at all is a byproduct of anthropocentrism[2][4][5]. A study has also been done to test an animal's understanding of death, which gives indirect evidence of an animal's capacity to understand death[5].","['Learning whether animals can grasp such concepts will help us to better understand their minds, and it could have important implications for the ways we treat them. But grappling with the concept of death is a trait long considered to belong to humans alone. Showing that animals can grasp it too—even on a smaller scale—would mean we’re not alone in engaging with our mortality.', 'Humans have a complex concept of death, weighed down by cultural baggage and myriad emotional responses. This is part of why many academics may not believe that animals can understand the concept of death, said Jennifer Vonk, a comparative psychologist at Oakland University. There hasn’t been much evidence that nonhuman animals can represent abstract, unobservable constructs.', 'Many agree that great apes and also monkeys show compassionate care for the dying, but whether they have an understanding of death is uncertain. Plenty of thanatologists have instead come to the opposite conclusion: that the animals they observe do not have a concept of death. As Charles Darwin wondered in The Descent of Man, “Who can say what cows feel, when they surround and stare intently on a dying or dead companion?”', 'Monsó believes that an outright assumption that animals can’t have even a minimum concept of death at all is a byproduct of anthropocentrism, or the centering of human thoughts and feelings and experience. She thinks there’s been too much of a focus on grief as a reaction to death, and that it clouds our interpretation of animals’ behavior.', 'Does this give us direct evidence of the animal’s understanding of death? Clearly, it doesn’t, given that the animal is not actually interacting with a dead individual. However, if an animal passes the test, it shows us that she has the necessary cognitive requirements to understand death. It shows us that she can process the crucial sub-components of a minimal concept of death. Thus, it gives indirect evidence of her capacity to understand death. Coupled with observational reports of the behaviours detailed above in the same species, this would amount to enough evidence to question the common assumption that animals cannot acquire a concept of death.']"
Why do so many foods contain carcinogens?,"Many foods contain carcinogens, which are compounds that can cause cancer[4]. Overcooking foods, especially meats, can produce carcinogens[1].

"Are humans the only animal that cries? If so, why?","Research suggests that humans are the only animal that cries for emotional reasons[1]. Crying can be defined as tearful sobbing, which humans are the only primates that do[3].

The reason why humans are the only animal that cries is still unknown.[5]","['Animals simply don’t cry. Or at least, they don’t shed emotional tears.

All mammals make distress calls, like when an offspring is separated from its mother, but only humans cry, he says."", 'In sum, if we define crying as tearful sobbing, then we know that humans are the only primates that cry. If we define crying as emitting vocalizations that co-occur with distressing situations, then we can conclude that most monkeys and apes cry, especially as infants. If we are really asking whether humans are the only primates that feel sorrow, then we do not know the answer. Yet.', 'It is also important to note that many pet owners claim that their animals cry and shed tears at the same time.

how do animals become domesticated?,"Animal domestication is the gradual process of animals becoming gentler and submitting to human instruction, which is tied to human domestication, or the human shift from hunter-gatherer to farmer[2]. As a species becomes more domesticated, it changes, with common changes including floppy ears, curly hair, changes in size and mating habits, and a decrease in sensory abilities[3]. Domestication is the process of adapting wild plants and animals for human use, raised and cared for by humans, and is divided into several grades of intensification[4].","['Domestication is the gradual process of animals becoming gentler and submitting to human instruction. In this process, an entire animal species evolves to become naturally accustomed to living among and interacting with humans.', ""From archeological evidence such as fossils, historians have learned a lot about man's domestication of animals. Animal domestication is partly tied to human domestication, or the human shift from hunter-gatherer to farmer. Though hunter-gatherers worked with domesticated dogs long before human domestication, later on, farmers saw the benefit of keeping livestock. As some people became farmers and started to settle in one place, raising domesticated livestock offered them the convenience of fresh meat as well as manure for fertilizing crops. Diamond points out that the civilizations that domesticated animals (and plants) consequently wielded more power and were able to spread their cultures and languages [source: Diamond]."", ""From what experts have learned about the progress of animal domestication, as a species becomes more domesticated, it changes. For example, domesticated animals' brains may become smaller and their sensory abilities less precise [source: Diamond]. Presumably, these changes occur because the animal doesn't need the same level of intelligence and sharp senses of sight and hearing for survival in a domesticated home. Other common changes include floppy ears, curly hair and especially changes in size and mating habits. Domesticated animals are more likely to mate year-round, rather than seasonally, as they do in the wild [source: Encyclopedia Britannica]. These changes and others often cause domesticated animals to look drastically different from their wild ancestors."", 'Domestication is the process of adapting wild plants and animals for human use. Domestic species are raised for food, work, clothing, medicine, and many other uses. Domesticated plants and animals must be raised and cared for by humans. Domesticated species are not wild.', 'Domestication can be considered as the final phase of intensification in the relationship between animal or plant sub-populations and human societies, but it is divided into several grades of intensification.

"How can cheese age so long and be edible, but then go bad after a little bit in the fridge?","Cheese can be aged for long periods of time and still be edible due to its low moisture content and the presence of bacteria that helps preserve the cheese. However, cheese can go bad quickly when left out in open air, especially in a warmer room, and start to look crusty and crumbly[2]. Soft and less-mature cheeses have a shorter shelf life in the fridge and should be consumed quickly[3][4]. Harder, aged cheeses can last four to six months in the fridge if stored correctly[4]. Research has also found that cheese can stay out for up to six hours at 70°F or colder[5].","[""Cheese and aging go hand-in-hand. It wouldn't be blue cheese without the mold, brie without the white rind, or Parmesan without the 10 months of maturation. There is, however, a big difference between properly aged cheese and cheese that has expired. While cheese is naturally stinky, and some can even last without refrigeration, eating it after its expiration date is generally a bad idea, especially because it can be hard to tell when it's actually past the point of safe consumption."", 'Long before you get an upset stomach from cheese (uh, unless you’re lactose intolerant), you’ll probably notice that it’s looking a little…sad. Cheese will dry out when left in open air, especially in a warmer room, and start to look crusty and crumbly. “After eight hours on a cheese board, cheddar will likely not have a lot of bacterial growth, but it won’t look appealing to eat,” Brock explains. However, there is no way to tell if there’s bacteria on a piece of cheese based on looking because it’s microscopic. One thing you can tell immediately about a cheese gone bad is if there’s mold growing on it in the fridge. If you see that, cut off about 1–1½ inches around the mold and continue eating it. However, if a high-moisture cheese like ricotta or cream cheese has a spot of mold, throw it out—it will have contaminated the entire container.', 'What\'s the fridge life? ""Soft, less-mature cheeses will go bad much more quickly than the hard or semi-hards,"" Freier said. ""I would be very careful eating them even one to two weeks after their expiration date. These cheeses have so much moisture inside them, they are kind of like ticking time bombs. So you should eat them quickly!""', 'What\'s the fridge life? ""Harder, aged cheeses will last the longest in the fridge out of any cheese,"" said Freier. ""Most can last four to six months in your fridge, if you store it correctly. All cheese will lose moisture and change over time — though harder cheeses have less internal moisture than most anyway, so they will be the least affected.""

Some cheeses tested for low levels of listeria, salmonella, Escherichia, and staphylococcus but nothing life-threatening.* Marianne Smukowski—a safety and quality applications coordinator at the Wisconsin Center for Dairy Research who helped conduct this study—explains that the level of water activity in a cheese determines how long it can stay out. Hard cheeses like Parmesan could be out for 24 hours and be fine, but a young cheddar is more vulnerable. “You will see oiling off and drying out from it sitting out in open air,” Smukowski explains.

Rabbit fur feels softer than dog fur. How does the structure of individual hairs affect the way they feel when touched?,"The structure of individual hairs affects the way they feel when touched due to the presence of sensitive nerves in the hair follicles. Rabbit whiskers, for example, have more sensitive nerves in their follicles than the typical fur or hair, so they can be used to get information about their surroundings[3]. Rabbit fur also has a soft undercoat and stiff guard hairs, which are thicker than the fur of other animals[3][4]. In addition, rabbit fur products tend to shed more easily than other furs, which affects the way they feel[5].","['Rabbit whiskers are just another type of hair. There are no nerves along the length of the whisker. The sense of touch works by triggering the sensitive nerves deep inside the whisker’s hair follicle. So pulling out the whiskers of a rabbit would cause pain, but snipping off the whiskers would not be painful for a rabbit.', 'For pet rabbits it may not be as necessary for their survival, but it would significantly challenge and change the way a rabbit perceives the world. A lack of whiskers for rabbits would mean they have a limited ability to use touch to help them identify anything. It would be similar to the way we humans feel things with our hands to get more information about objects through touch. We would still be able to function and go through daily life, but it would significantly change the way we interact with the world around us.', 'Whiskers, also called vibrissae, are a type of stiff and thick hair that is found on many different types of animals. These hairs are set deep into the follicles on a rabbit’s skin, much deeper than the follicles for typical fur or hair. These special follicles also have extra sensitive nerves that are triggered whenever the rabbit’s whiskers move. They are sensitive to very delicate touches so your rabbit can use their whiskers to get information about their surroundings.', ""Rabbits have very thin and delicate skin that is covered with fine fur comprised of both a soft undercoat and stiff guard hairs. Care must be taken when clipping fur because the skin is prone to tearing. Unlike dogs and cats, rabbits lack footpads; instead, their feet are covered with thick coarse fur that protects the plantar and palmar surfaces of the feet. Because they lack footpads, rabbits should be provided soft padded areas within their enclosures. Rabbits have nonretractable claws, making declawing an inappropriate procedure. Certain breeds of female rabbits have a dewlap, which is analogous to a second chin. Female rabbits may pluck fur from the dewlap during the breeding season to build a nest. Male and female rabbits may have three types of scent glands, including a single chin gland, paired inguinal glands, and paired anal glands. The glands are used to mark the rabbit's territory."", 'Rabbit fur products have a tendency to shed more easily than some other furs and might not have the same longevity.']"
Why do people and animals die from wild forest fires? Do they really spread that fast or just creep on you until it's too late?,"Wildfires can be both dangerous and beneficial to wildlife. In the short term, some animals die in the flames, usually the elderly and young animals who cannot escape[1][5]. However, the majority of wildlife mortalities come after the fire is out, due to the loss of important habitat and food sources burned in the fire[1]. Animals have a honed sense of danger and can run away or take cover to avoid the hazard[4], while some predators even capitalize on the fire and hunt smaller animals fleeing from the flames[4]. Wildfires can also create a new type of habitat and provide benefits in the long term, such as fertilizing soil for the seeds of certain plants to grow, removing dead and diseased plants, and increasing biodiversity.","['Some animals do die in the flames of wildfires, mostly the elderly and very young animals who can’t escape. However, the majority of wildlife mortalities come after the fire is out, due to the loss of important habitat and food sources burned in the fire. The burns create a new type of habitat, usually open areas where dense forests used to be that are quickly colonized by grasses and shrubs. This creates an opportunity for invasive species to move in before native species get the chance, which can have harmful impacts on the landscape.', 'Wildfires are apart of a healthy ecosystem, and while they may inflict some animal casualties in the short term, they are a part of the natural cycle. Without them, forests become overgrown and burn more intensely when they do catch flame. Animals have developed their own methods of avoiding fire danger, so don’t worry too much about Bambi.', 'Wildfire causes wildlife to move, avoiding flames and searching for new habitat. This migration can cause animals to wander into densely human populated areas and come into contact with humans they would normally avoid. However, there are many positives to wildlife and the ecosystem at large as well.', 'Animals have a honed sense of danger, so when wildfire occurs, most animals sense it and can run away or stand in streams to avoid the hazard. Smaller animals take cover in logs, under rocks, or by burying themselves in the dirt. Some animal predators even capitalize on the fire, and have been observed hunting smaller animals who are fleeing the fire. Another positive impact from wildfires is that some species, like the jack pine, rely on fire to release their seeds. Ashes that the fire leaves behind fertilize the soil for the seeds can grow. Fire suppression over the past century has led to dense, overgrown forests, and fire removes dead and diseased plants, allowing more sunlight to reach the ground. Healthy small fires lead to ‘islands’ of different microhabitats, which increases biodiversity which in turn increases the resiliency of the ecosystem.', 'Who can forget the iconic forest fire scene in the Disney’s Bambi? For many young children, myself included, this is the first exposure to wildfire. Adorable and helpless bunnies, possums and deer running from a fire set by a man. So, what exactly is the impact of forest fires on wildlife? It turns out that like most things in life, it’s a mixed bag. On one hand, wildfire is a natural part of the ecosystem in the western United States, and wildlife has a long relationship with it. Some species even benefit from the blazes. On the other hand, of course fire can be dangerous to animals and plants that can’t outrun it.']"
"What are artificial flavors made of, and how are different flavors created?","Artificial flavors are chemical mixtures created in a lab, rather than isolated from natural food ingredients[4].

"Why do we always ask animals and babies what they're doing, even though we know they can't respond?","People often ask animals and babies questions, even though they know they won't be able to respond, because they tend to see something human in them and their cuteness and responsiveness enforce that tendency[1]. With animals, people often think of them as little members of the family, so it's natural to talk to them[5]. Additionally, some people may not want animals to be conscious because it makes it easier for them to do things to animals that would be hard to do if they knew they were unhappy and suffering[3]. On the other hand, it is hard to deny that animals have a conscious mental experience of play, sleep, fear, or love, as evidenced by the way they respond to the world around them[4].","['But when it comes to our impulse to speak to our pets, it seems their understanding of what we say is kind of beside the point, anyway. Those who talk to their pets likely aren’t doing so because they believe those pets are processing language; they do so because they tend to see something human in them—and a pet’s cuteness and responsiveness enforce that tendency.', 'If people are speaking to their pets—and in anthrozoological studies, Herzog says, the pet studied is almost always a dog (he explains that this is a result of the long-standing bond between humans and dogs, and interest in the therapeutic effects of dog companionship)—they’re usually doing so in short, simple, grammatically correct sentences. Rarely do people ask open-ended questions (my asking Mila and Martin how their days were puts me in the minority, it turns out), and usually they speak in a higher-pitched voice. It’s similar to the way people speak to babies, whose big-eyed, button-nosed cuteness elicits a parental, caretaking response in us—and big-eyed, button-nosed pets spark a similar response.', 'With the public, I think it’s quite different. Many people simply assume that animals act consciously and base their belief on their own domestic animals or pets. Other people do not want animals to be conscious because it makes it easier for us to do things to animals that would be hard to do if we knew they were unhappy and suffering.', 'It is incredible to me there is still a debate over whether animals are conscious and even a debate over whether human beings can know animals are conscious. If you watch mammals or even birds, you will see how they respond to the world. They play. They act frightened when there’s danger. They relax when things are good. It seems illogical for us to think that animals might not be having a conscious mental experience of play, sleep, fear or love.', 'Humans can do this with just about anything—one might feel bad for the colored pencil that never gets used, or get angry at the phone that won’t hold a charge, or feel real grief over news that a hitchhiking robot has been abused.

- Everyone accepts that climate change is catastrophic and we suddenly need to do something drastic. Would we be able to stop all negative effects if we stopped burning fossil fuels overnight?,"No, it would not be possible to stop all negative effects of climate change if we stopped burning fossil fuels overnight. While stopping emissions would be a step in the right direction, it would not be enough to reverse the effects of climate change. The Earth will still warm, and the response to warming is more warming through feedbacks associated with melting ice and increased atmospheric water vapor[2]. In addition, even if we stopped emitting carbon dioxide right now, there would still be a delay in air-temperature increase as the atmosphere catches up with all the heat that the Earth has accumulated[4]. Lastly, in order to stop the accumulation of heat, we would have to eliminate not just carbon dioxide emissions, but all greenhouse gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, as well as reverse deforestation and other land uses that affect the Earth’s energy balance[5].","['The truth is there is not a hard and fast deadline on climate action vs. inaction. Some studies and articles suggest that unless we make significant progress towards decarbonization (reducing carbon from the atmosphere and replacing fossil fuels in our economies) by 2030, we may be facing catastrophic climate impacts that would overwhelm our communities and pose an existential threat to certain ecosystems.', 'If we stop our emissions today, we won’t go back to the past. The Earth will warm. And since the response to warming is more warming through feedbacks associated with melting ice and increased atmospheric water vapor, our job becomes one of limiting the warming. If greenhouse gas emissions are eliminated quickly enough, within a small number of decades, it will keep the warming manageable and the Paris Agreement goals could be met. It will slow the change – and allow us to adapt. Rather than trying to recover the past, we need to be thinking about best possible futures.', 'In any event, it’s not possible to stop emitting carbon dioxide right now. Despite significant advances in renewable energy sources, total demand for energy accelerates and carbon dioxide emissions increase. As a professor of climate and space sciences, I teach my students they need to plan for a world 4℃ warmer. A 2011 report from the International Energy Agency states that if we don’t get off our current path, then we’re looking at an Earth 6℃ warmer. Even now after the Paris Agreement, the trajectory is essentially the same. It’s hard to say we’re on a new path until we see a peak and then a downturn in carbon emissions. With the approximately 1℃ of warming we’ve already seen, the observed changes are already disturbing.', 'So if we stop emitting carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels today, it’s not the end of the story for global warming. There’s a delay in air-temperature increase as the atmosphere catches up with all the heat that the Earth has accumulated. After maybe 40 more years, scientists hypothesize the climate will stabilize at a temperature higher than what was normal for previous generations.', 'In order to stop the accumulation of heat, we would have to eliminate not just carbon dioxide emissions, but all greenhouse gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide. We’d also need to reverse deforestation and other land uses that affect the Earth’s energy balance (the difference between incoming energy from the sun and what’s returned to space). We would have to radically change our agriculture. If we did this, it would eliminate additional planetary warming, and limit the rise of air temperature. Such a cessation of warming is not possible.']"
Is it really necessary to neuter my indoor male cat?,"Yes, it is necessary to neuter your indoor male cat. Neutering prevents your cat from breeding and adding to the cat population[2], and also reduces the risk of unwanted behaviors, health problems, and feral cat populations[4]. Neutering also decreases the likelihood of your cat becoming aggressively territorial if other cats come around[5]. Though your cat is indoors and there is no danger of pregnancy, the benefits of neutering outweigh the risks[1][4].","['If you are an indoor-only cat owner and you only have one cat (or one gender of cat) in your home, you may be tempted to skip the neutering or spaying of your fur baby. If your cat(s) live only in the house, and there’s no danger of pregnancy inside your house, why should you do it?', 'Neutering also prevents your male cat from breeding and adding to the cat population. Unlike female cats, male cats do not need to go through heat cycles in order to breed.', 'You may have plans to keep your cat inside for their whole life, but cats can have other plans. It may seem unnecessary to spay or neuter indoor cats, considering that they may be at lower risk of having kittens, which is the whole point of the surgery anyway, right? Your team at Animal Medical Hospital & 24 Hour Urgent Care is here to help show how spay and neuter can protect against so much more!', 'Veterinarians recommend neutering most male cats. Unless you plan to breed your cat responsibly and are prepared to keep him indoors, neutering will reduce the risk of unwanted behaviors, health problems, and feral cat populations. Feline neutering is a common procedure and complications are rare. Still, any procedure that involves surgery can cause anxiety for pet owners. We will go over the risks and benefits of neutering your cat, as well as how the procedure is performed, so that you have all the information you need prior to his surgery.', 'Neutering does substantially decrease the likelihood of that happening. If other cats happen to come around (even outside), he may be provoked and occasionally cats may even become aggressively territorial which is more pronounced in intact male cats.']"
How's come so many things are made from plastic but water bottles and trashbags seem to be the only thing made out of recycled plastic?,"The reason why water bottles and trashbags seem to be the only things made out of recycled plastic is because they are the only types of plastic that are truly recyclable in the U.S. today[4]. Other types of plastic, such as those used for detergent bottles, food and drink storage, bottle caps, thicker shopping bags, and non-single-use plastic products, can also be recycled, but are not typically recycled[3]. This is because of the glut of natural gas and the resulting boom in U.S. petrochemical production, which makes virgin plastic cheaper than recycled plastic[2]. Furthermore, only 29 percent of PET bottles are collected for recycling, and of this, only 21 percent of the bottles are actually made into recycled materials due to contamination[4]. Plastic is easy to recycle, and all plastic can be recycled[1][3][4][5], but there is too much plastic being produced and not enough viable end markets for it[2].","['Another complication is found within the products themselves. While some goods, like water bottles and other drink bottles, are frequently made from a single, common plastic (such as PETE) allowing them to be easily recycled, many others are designed to use a mix of plastics, which can cause serious issues in our current plastic recycling process. What’s more, many products are a mix of plastics and non-plastics such as wood or metal. Sadly, these products won’t even go near a recycling center.', 'Although companies that make and sell plastic push the idea that recycling is the answer to the plastic pollution problem, six times more plastic waste is incinerated than is recycled. The CEO of Recology, a company that collects and processes municipal solid waste, wrote in a 2018 op-ed, “The simple fact is, there is just too much plastic—and too many different types of plastics being produced; and there exist few, if any, viable end markets for the material.” Moreover, because of the glut of natural gas and the resulting boom in U.S. petrochemical production, virgin plastic is now cheaper than recycled plastic.', 'More rigid than PETE, this type of plastic is used in what will appear to be “sturdier” products such as detergent bottles, food and drink storage, bottle caps, some thicker shopping bags, and non-single-use plastic products like toys, helmets, and piping. Again, this type of plastic is widely recycled.', 'A recent Greenpeace report found that some PET (#1) and HDPE (#2) plastic bottles are the only types of plastic that are truly recyclable in the U.S. today; and yet only 29 percent of PET bottles are collected for recycling, and of this, only 21 percent of the bottles are actually made into recycled materials due to contamination. China used to accept plastics #3 through #7, which were mostly burned for fuel. Today #3 – #7 plastics may be collected in the U.S., but they are not typically recycled; they usually end up incinerated, buried in landfills or exported. In fact Greenpeace is asking companies such as Nestle, Walmart, Proctor & Gamble and Unilever that label their products made with #3 -#7 plastics as “recyclable” to stop or it will file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission for mislabeling.', 'Plastic is easy to recycle, and all plastic can be recycled. Some studies show that only 10 percent of plastic bottles created are recycled, leaving that extra 90 percent to take up space in landfills, the side of the road and sometimes ending up in the ocean.']"
Why can't vet drugs to put animals down be used for inmates sentenced to death?,"Vet drugs used to put animals down cannot be used for inmates sentenced to death because it is impossible to tell whether the inmate is suffering during the administration of the drug without medical professionals to monitor the effectiveness[2]. Also, Kentucky prohibits using a paralytic in animal killings, which means that a single, large dose of a barbiturate like pentobarbital is not an option[2][3][4].","[""It seems that methods of execution for convicted criminals are constantly being debated for whether they cause undue pain or suffering. However, thousands of times a day, vets put down cats, hamsters, dogs, and other animals (some easily matching humans mass) with a simple shot that we're told causes the animal to just peacefully drift off and never wake up. Why can't the same drug/s be used for executions?"", 'Without medical professionals to monitor the effectiveness of the first drug, it’s impossible to tell whether the inmate is suffering during the administration of the second and third drugs during lethal injections. That’s why advocates for death-row inmates argue that it’d be much safer just to execute prisoners using a single large dose of a barbiturate like pentobarbital, as we commonly do with pets. The method, which knocks the patient out and eventually causes cardiac arrest, carries almost no risk of pain. Alper points out that “Euthanasia in shelters is performed by shelter workers who are not formally trained in veterinary medicine. By developing a procedure with no risk of pain, and a wide margin for error, the veterinary community has accounted for the difficulty posed by relatively untrained personnel administering the lethal procedure.”', 'The two death-row inmates who object to Kentucky’s method argue that a large enough dose of a barbiturate, the most common way of putting down animals, is a safer, less potentially painful way to carry out executions. Kentucky prohibits using a paralytic in animal killings.', ""The two death-row inmates who object to Kentucky's method argue that a large enough dose of a barbiturate, the most common way of putting down animals, is a safer, less potentially painful way to carry out executions.

But here’s the thing: Lawyers for death-row inmates would actually prefer to have their clients put down like family pets. It carries much less risk of pain than the standard three-drug lethal injection protocol. Oklahoma isn’t actually proposing to adopt the veterinary method: Animals are put to sleep with a single, large dose of a barbiturate called pentobarbital, while the state wants to use a smaller dose of pentobarbital to knock out patients before applying the lethal drugs. But consider the irony: When it comes to death-row inmates, dying like a dog seems like a gentle way to go.']"
"Crabs regrow limbs; Why do we eat the whole crab, and not just the limbs?","While crabs can regrow lost limbs and claws, the process is time-consuming and involves a lot of energy, so the empirical occurrence of regenerated claws in fishery harvests is low[2]. Additionally, crabs cannot regrow more advanced organs such as their eyes[3]. Therefore, it is more efficient to eat the whole crab, rather than just the limbs. Research has been done to explore why crabs can regenerate limbs and humans cannot, and whether humans may be able to possess that ability some day.","['Just like other crustaceans e.g. Crayfish and lobsters, crabs can indeed regrow their limbs. Crabs have evolved this ability due to their limbs being relatively loosely attached and are prone to loss when fighting other crabs for territory, mates and food.', ""The central argument for declawing is that because crabs can regenerate lost limbs, it is inherently more sustainable than the capture of whole crabs. Yet claws are a large portion of a crab's biomass, ranging from 20% to over 50% of some species' total weight, and thus regeneration can be highly energy- and time-consuming.: 207  The empirical occurrence of regenerated claws in fishery harvests is low, with studies on stone crabs calculating from less than 10% (Davis et al., 1978), to 13% (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, 2011). Larger, older crabs generally do not survive long enough to regrow their claws, as they are near the end of their lifespan."", 'While crabs can regrow all their legs and claws (which are technically also legs) they cannot regrow more advanced organs such as their eyes.', 'Except for lizards regrowing their tails, crabs are perhaps the animals best known for their ability to regenerate lost limbs.

Why does unhealthy foods taste better then healthy foods? Shouldn't our body make healthier foods taste better?,"Unhealthy foods tend to taste better than healthy foods because they are engineered to taste extra good, and our taste buds are regularly conditioned by both internal and external factors to want them[3]. Additionally, the brain is aware of what would provide more energy and calmness, so it sends signals and makes us want what is generally bad for our health[1]. Furthermore, it may be that we are not eating high quality healthy food; organic, fresh, locally grown fruits and vegetables, grass-fed beef, and free-range chicken and eggs tend to taste especially vibrant and flavorful[5].","['Since we now know the scientific reason behind craving unhealthy food, it makes sense why healthy choices taste bad to us.

"If Hemp produces paper and and other products cheaper, which means more profit, why hasn't the Tree Cutting (Logging?) Industry pushed for legalization?","Despite the advantages of hemp paper, there are still hindrances such as legal restrictions and the technology to process it not being as advanced as tree paper[1]. Additionally, it would take a lot of time, hard work, and long-term investment to overturn the current paper production system[3][5]. Furthermore, the tree cutting industry is more entrenched in the current paper production system, and it would be difficult for them to make the transition to hemp paper. It is also worth noting that legalizing the growth of industrial hemp would not mean the same thing as legalizing recreational drug use, as the hemp used for paper does not contain THC[5].","[""Despite the points in favor of hemp paper, it also has some hindrances. Legal restrictions still make hemp cultivation and production difficult. Similarly, the technology for processing it isn't as advanced as that of tree papers. At present, it’s relatively cheaper to create paper from wood pulp, a process we’ve perfected over the years, making it more affordable."", 'Because the need for paper can’t be expected to decline to extinction, we, as caretakers of the planet, need to look at making paper production a more economically efficient process than it is now. One way of doing so would be to find a cleaner, faster source for paper material than trees. Trees contain a relatively small amount of cellulose, the primary ingredient for paper. Hemp has a much higher concentration of cellulose and has a long history of being used for paper, as well as many other products such as rope, clothing, and textiles. While harvesting trees isn’t necessarily an environmentally harmful solution for paper demand, harvesting hemp instead is a far more efficient one.', 'Despite the drawbacks, industrial hemp would be much more economically efficient than trees when it comes to the production of paper. Hemp would be faster to grow, take up less space, and produce a stronger, more versatile product. It’s already replacing trees successfully in other places around the world, such as in Canada, proving that it’s a plausible solution to rising paper demand. Replacing tree paper with hemp paper would not be easy, but for the sake of long-term sustainability, it would be worth it.', 'Vermont, she related, a bill recommending a study of the feasibility of growing hemp passed in the legislature but was vetoed by the governor. Peter Hopkins, representing Crane & Company, said that Crane had been making paper with various fibers for almost 200 years, and its product is considered the best in the world. It makes U.S. currency paper out of cotton and flax and recycles old currency by combining it with cotton rag. Its cotton rag paper is well known for its quality. It makes a ""blue jeans"" paper: Levi Strauss separates its cotton waste, Crane makes the waste into paper, and Levi buys it back for internal use. It works cooperatively with farmers to make kenaf paper. At one time, Crane did buy a forest and make paper from tree fibers -- until the company ran out of trees.', 'As far as drawbacks go, it’s worth remembering that legalizing the growth of industrial hemp would not mean the same thing as legalizing recreational drug use. The hemp used for paper is a different strain of the cannabis plant than marijuana and doesn’t contain THC. Once grown, it can’t be used retroactively as a drug. Fighting for industrial hemp and fighting for marijuana are two different battles, and in this case legalization should be a non-issue. Overturning the current paper production system would take time, hard work, and long-term investment, but realistically it’s possible and preferable.']"
What ecological disaster happened on earth in the movie “interstellar “ ? Is it an actual possibility ?,"In the movie “Interstellar”, the Earth has been decimated by an ecological disaster caused by a crop disease called “a blight”[1][4]. The movie suggests that the problem is not humanity, but the Earth itself, and never mentions climate change or any references to humankind's responsibility for the disaster[3][5]. It is an actual possibility, as climate change is likely to recreate the conditions of the Dust Bowl depicted in the film[5].","['Climate change is never mentioned by name in the film, but writer/director Christopher Nolan uses its imagery to define the terms of his story. Interstellar is set in a near-future Earth on the verge of total ecological collapse, with drastic changes in weather patterns and devastating food shortages driving human beings to the brink of extinction. We never learn exactly what caused this devastation (there is a vague reference to a crop disease called “a blight”), but Cooper, the tough and tender protagonist played by Matthew McConaughey, pins it on a failure of the human spirit: “We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars. Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt,” he says early on. When he is asked to lead a secret NASA expedition to look for another planet to colonize, he gets a chance to live by those words.', 'Interstellar does wrestle with the problem of human nature. In the movie, (the appropriately-named) Dr. Mann, who is supposed to represent ""the best of humanity"", almost dooms the human race to extinction because of selfishness and weakness. But the movie fails to draw the connection between human nature and the environmental catastrophe unfolding back on Earth.', ""In fact, as Cooper and Donald's dialogue above shows, the movie suggests that the problem is not humanity, but the Earth itself. And so, when we see, near the end of the movie, gigantic cylindrical space vessels filled with fields of corn⁴ on their way to their new home, it's not surprising that the writers never explain how they avoided carrying the blight with them from Earth. There is no critique of industrial monoculture farming to be found in Interstellar, no suggestion that the blight might have been related to those practices. The reason is that they never connected the blight to human choices in the first place. If they had, they would have realized that intergalactic space travel isn’t the fastest route to food security."", 'Interstellar is set in a future where Earth has been decimated by ecological disaster. Joseph Cooper, a former NASA pilot, lives on a farm with his daughter, ‘Murph’. After a dust storm, they notice a strange pattern of dust on Murph’s bedroom floor. Murph thinks she has a ghost in her room, but Cooper realizes the pattern is due to gravitational variations emanating from her bookshelf.', ""Never once in the movie Interstellar is there any explanation of why the blight is happening. Climate change is never mentioned or even alluded to, in spite of the fact that climate change is likely to recreate the conditions of the Dust Bowl depicted in the film. This omission is all the more remarkable considering how common such references have become in popular culture. In fact, conspicuously absent from the movie are any references at all to humankind's responsibility for the environmental disaster which is driving them to leave the planet. The viewer is left to believe that the Earth itself, in the fashion of the ancient Greek gods, has just capriciously decided to wipe out humanity.⁵""]"
"How is it not illegal for corporations to practically write laws and lobby them through congress, at the expense of the best interests of the people?","The reason why it is not illegal for corporations to practically write laws and lobby them through Congress is because lobbying is a constitutionally protected right. The First Amendment to the Constitution states that “Congress shall make no law abridging the right of the people to petition the government for a redress of grievances”[1], and the Supreme Court has ruled that corporations can spend freely to support or oppose candidates for president and Congress[2]. Despite this, the lobbying system in the US is heavily weighted in favor of corporations and the wealthy[3][4], and there is little transparency in the lobbying process[1][4]. Because of this, it is possible for corporations to write their own laws and to lobby for narrow provisions that go unnoticed.[5]","['Many trade associations or groups of like-minded entities pool resources to engage lobbyists because on their own they would be either ineffective or incapable of influencing outcomes. Lobbying is at the core of the governmental process and protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution: “Congress shall make no law abridging the right of the people to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” With thousands of bills being introduced in a two-year session, effective lobbyists provide lawmakers the information necessary to make sound, fact-based decisions.', 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Corporations can spend freely to support or oppose candidates for president and Congress, the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday, a landmark decision denounced by President Barack Obama for giving special interests more power.', 'So how does this happen? How can the wealthy and corporations so thoroughly dominate in our legislative system? Much of the answer to this question is lobbying – the organized effort to sway the decisions of policymakers. Lobbying plays a major role in determining whose problems and concerns get the attention of Congress and whose arguments get a better hearing. Congress does not listen to average Americans because often their voice is drowned out by the relentless shouting of special interest lobbies. Lobbying can be an important form of political participation, but today our lobbying system is actually working to undermine democracy and to make the political system responsive to the few, not the many. Importantly, the political systems of most other Western democracies are designed in a way that reduces the influence of wealthy lobbies.', 'Our lobbying system violates many of the basic attributes of a democracy – especially the principle of political equality. One could imagine a way that lobbying would fit well into a democratic system. If all interests had lobbies, and if those lobbies had a relatively equal chance of getting heard in the policymaking process that could help to make policymakers more responsive to the public. And to be fair, most interests do in fact have a lobbying presence in Washington. These include business, unions, environmentalists, religious groups, the elderly, doctors, gun rights advocates, women’s groups, farmers, etc. The existence of all these lobbying groups can give the appearance of a fair and balanced competition between all interests. But as Lee Drutman explains, this is only an illusion – corporations are by far the dominant force in the lobbying system.', 'Lee Drutman has argued for legislation that would make lobbying much more transparent. As he points out, “organizations lobbying do not have to disclose which offices they visited, nor do they have to disclose the position for which they advocated or the draft legislation they left behind.” But we could require them to submit a public report within 48 hours summarizing the meeting, who attended, and what was being advocated for. This would make it more difficult for monied interests to write their own bills and to secretly lobby for narrow provisions in bills that now often go unnoticed.']"
Why is the Australian government largely ignoring environmental issues in the country?,"The Australian government is largely ignoring environmental issues in the country due to a lack of urgency and a changed mindset to accept that climate change is an immediate threat[3].

Why do humans need such a variety of foods when animals usually only have one and get so much bigger and stronger then humans?,"Humans need to eat a variety of foods to get a balance of nutrients, whereas animals can survive on their specific diets by consuming the organs of their prey which contain vital nutrients[2]. Humans generally prefer eating only the meat (i.e., the muscle tissue) of animals, which is not nearly as rich in nutrients as their inner organs and therefore need to consume a variety of foods to get a sufficient amount of nutrients[3]. Although humans can survive on a very unhealthy diet, it is necessary to consume a balanced diet to lead an active, happy life[2][4]. Humans are capable of adapting to many habitats and combining many different foods to create many healthy diets, but the modern Western diet does not appear to be one of them[5].","['Have you ever thought about why humans need such a varied diet with so many different foods, whereas animals can get by with such narrow diets?', '""Animals have evolved to survive on their specific diets by consuming the organs of their prey which contain vital nutrients. Humans have evolved to survive on a limited diet by consuming a variety of foods which provide a balance of nutrients. However, humans have a longer lifespan than animals and want to lead an active, happy life, so consuming a balanced diet is necessary.', 'Humans, on other hand, generally prefer eating only the meat (i.e., the muscle tissue) of animals, which is not nearly as rich in nutrients as their inner organs. As a result, humans lose out on a sufficient amount of nutrients by restricting themselves to just eating meat.', 'It’s interesting to note that we humans need an astonishingly small variety in our diet to survive. An individual can survive for many years by following a very narrow, specific diet. As a species, humans can do just fine if they eat a very unhealthy diet; consuming a balanced diet is hardly a requirement to survive.', 'In other words, there is no one ideal human diet. Aiello and Leonard say the real hallmark of being human isn’t our taste for meat but our ability to adapt to many habitats—and to be able to combine many different foods to create many healthy diets. Unfortunately the modern Western diet does not appear to be one of them.']"
How can makeup not be tested on animals?,"Makeup can be tested without the use of animals by relying on products that are already deemed safe[3][5]. Many of these ingredients have already been tested in the past and don’t require additional testing. Companies can also use cornea-like 3D structures, which are produced from human cells, to test the safety of their products[5]. Additionally, animal testing is ineffective since the physiology of nonhuman animal species is different from that of humans and the potential reactions of animals could be completely unrelated to humans[1][3]. There is an international movement to ban makeup testing on animals, and in North America, Mexico has passed a law banning the manufacture, import, and marketing of cosmetics tested on animals elsewhere in the world[4].","['The main reason for opposition to animal testing of makeup products is the pain and suffering of the nonhuman animals, who can’t give consent to participate in experiments on their bodies. But on top of this, the physiology of nonhuman animal species is different from that of humans, and this makes animal testing a flawed method of assessing product safety.', 'While many countries have limited or banned the sale of makeup that relies on nonhuman animal testing, there are often still gaps in the laws that allow for such testing to occur.', 'Makeup seems harmless, but when the thought of animal testing comes to mind, it’s anything but. We often forget that the products we use every day are potentially tested on animals. According to Cruelty-Free International, animal testing is pretty pointless; the science of it is ineffective, as animals don’t develop the same diseases humans do. As for cosmetic testing, the potential reactions of animals could be completely unrelated to humans.', 'There is an international movement to ban makeup testing on animals, and in North America, Mexico is leading the way. In September 2021, Mexico passed a law banning “the manufacture, import, and marketing of cosmetics tested on animals elsewhere in the world,” as a result of campaigns led by Humane Society International and Te Protejo, as well as other advocacy groups. These efforts have even earned the support of industry giants like Lush, Unilever, P&G, L’Oréal, and Avon. More than 40 countries and many states in Brazil and the U.S. have passed some form of prohibition against makeup testing on nonhuman animals. Yet a lot more needs to be done to end the unnecessary cruelty of animal testing.', ""Animal testing is simply unnecessary. This doesn't mean that we should instead put humans in danger. A solution to animal testing is for companies to use products that are already deemed safe. There are tons of ingredients that have already been confirmed as safe for human skin.

These human skin cultures can be grown and purchased specifically for cosmetic testing.""]"
Why is there such a disconnect in terms of content offered between music streaming services and video streaming services?,"The disconnect between music streaming services and video streaming services is mainly due to the fact that video streaming services such as YouTube do not obtain the proper licenses for the recorded music they stream and do not pay fees that are comparable to those paid by other streaming services[1]. This allows video streaming services to compete unfairly against specialist audio streaming services, traditional audio or television broadcasters, and also treats creators unfairly[1][3]. Additionally, users are more likely to pay for music streaming services due to the lack of advertisement interruptions and the ability to access millions of songs and create their own playlists. This unfair competition and lack of proper licensing has led to criticism of streaming services and caused many artists to feel they have been treated unfairly[5].","['A second concern that has been highlighted is that the video streaming activity of YouTube effectively competes with specialist music streaming services, but (and in contrast to YouTube’s own music streaming service), it does not obtain proper licenses for the recorded music it streams, nor does it pay fees analogous to those paid by other streaming services. Instead it offers content publishers a share of the advertising revenues that it earns from their content. It is not straightforward to compare the resulting payments made by YouTube’s video streaming service on a per stream basis, but they appear to be substantially lower than are paid by the specialist audio streaming platforms (including YouTube’s own). As such, YouTube video arguably competes unfairly against specialist audio-streaming services, as well as against radio stations and television, and also treats creators unfairly.', 'The online streaming world for both video and music content is growing fast. Not only are more and more people turning to such services for the pure ease of streaming what they want when they want, but we’re also seeing a spike in new streaming services.', 'A final area of concern, linked to the YouTube-related concern discussed above, is that streaming platforms are able to compete unfairly against traditional audio or television broadcasters, and increasingly expand directly into these activities. First, if these platforms can acquire music content at an unfairly low per minute rate relative to radio or television broadcasters, then this gives them an undue competitive advantage against broadcasters that offer higher royalties to creators.', 'A 2021 survey revealed the top reason users paid for a music streaming service was to stop advertisements interrupting the music stream. Other top reasons: listening to what they want when they want it, having access to millions of songs and having access to their own playlists.28', 'It is therefore both timely and important to reflect on the extent to which streaming services provide a level playing field for those involved in producing recorded music: labels, publishers, composers, performers, producers. This is also topical since streaming has received substantial criticism, with many artists considering that they have been treated unfairly by streaming, despite the overall boost it has given to industry revenues.']"
Why do we feel so strong love to animals thats often stronger than our love to fellow humans?,"There are several reasons why we feel a strong love for animals that is often stronger than our love for fellow humans. One reason is that animals require our attention, help, and concern, and we instinctively care for them and desire to help them because they are unable to easily help themselves, which is similar to the way we care for our children[1]. Additionally, we often feel empathy for certain large, charismatic wild animals such as elephants, dolphins, or lions[2]. A recent study found that people who love animals have a specific version of the gene that produces the love hormone oxytocin, which is important for empathy between humans and boosts social bonding[5]. The results of this study also suggested that people value their pet relationships so strongly because they see their furry family members as having child-like qualities[4].","['This can also relate to the human-animal bond many of us feel, as they require our attention, help, and concern.

So oxytocin helps people bond with animals too, and animal lovers are friendlier people and have more empathy.']"
Why do animals feed other animals of a different species?,"Animals may feed other animals of a different species due to a variety of reasons. It is thought that the desire to give food to other animals may drive domestication as much as the human desire to eat them does[4]. Additionally, animals may feed other animals of a different species for self-preservation, as they identify as part of a group rather than just an individual[2]. It is also suggested that animals may feed other animals of a different species in order to gain some sort of benefit for themselves.","['Many people insist that eating animals is “natural” — and therefore morally neutral — because other animals eat animals. But it’s important to realize that, with a few exceptions, when humans kill other animals for food, we’re not doing what animals do in nature. Humans have no biological need to consume meat or any animal products. When animals kill other animals for food, they do as they must, in order to survive; they have no choice in the matter. Many humans, on the other hand, do have a choice, and when people with access to plant-based foods choose to continue eating animals anyway — simply because they like the taste — they are harming animals not from necessity, but for pleasure. Yet harming animals for pleasure goes against core values we hold in common — which is why, for example, we oppose practices like dog fighting on principle. It can’t be wrong to harm animals for pleasure in one instance, but not the other.', ""Other scientists note that it's more common for animals to help other members of their same species, especially if they are closely related, live together, or are part of a group. Helping other animals in this way is basically self-preservation, because they identify as part of a group rather than just an individual."", 'Humans feed animals all the time, whether it’s our pets, the chickens we plan to eat or the ducks at the park pond, even though we shouldn’t.', 'Throughout history in fat years and lean across many cultures, sometimes with no apparent reason, humans have fed animals of every imaginable stripe in every imaginable way. Some researchers think the desire to give food to other animals may drive domestication as much as the human desire to eat them does.', ""Why would these whales forgo opportunities to feed, waste energy, and risk injury to protect another species? Biologists will tell you that adult animals rarely do anything unless there's a benefit to themselves, so they usually examine behavior to determine how it might benefit the animal.""]"
"Why does our sense of taste generally prefer unhealthy things (pizza, burger etc.) over healthy ones (broccoli etc.)?","There are several reasons why our sense of taste generally prefers unhealthy things over healthy ones. One is that the alluring smell of unhealthy food increases people’s sense of taste when they eat it, making the experience more enjoyable. Another reason is that culture often overrides our genes and takes over the mouth’s role as the body’s gatekeeper, so we often learn to like what people around us like[2]. Additionally, our food preferences may be an evolutionary survival skill, as they evolved to evoke strong emotions to help us find food and mates, and avoid poisons and predators[3]. Also, if we are used to having sugary, fatty or salty food, then when someone asks us to try something healthy like broccoli, we may find it tasteless or missing something[4]. Finally, picky eaters may have a more acute sensitivity to bitterness, which is why they may eat more cruciferous vegetables than others[5].","['This has a serious effect on how people perceive the taste of junk food. The alluring smell increases people’s sense of taste when they eat it, causing the experience to be more enjoyable. Many of us associate certain smells to memories. Fast food could easily remind us of childhood memories where a trip to McDonald’s might have been a familiar treat.', 'A Washington Post piece entitled “Our Taste Buds are Just One Reason We Love Some Foods and Hate Others” explained the nature versus nurture side of taste. “Culture often overrides our genes and takes over the mouth’s role as the body’s gatekeeper. Few people immediately like bitter beverages or extreme spices, but many learn to love them through repeated exposure. We often learn to like what people around us like.” You see this often with children. They initially may reject a food only to eat it the eighth or tenth time around. And you see tastes changing with time. I grew up disliking salty foods or certainly not seeking them out. Now? I can’t get enough. Does it have something to do with being married to a saltaholic? It might although he doesn’t like mushrooms just because I do, hmn.', 'Some feel our food preferences are an evolutionary survival skill. “The senses of smell and taste evolved to evoke strong emotions because they were critical to finding food and mates and avoiding poisons and predators.” A study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition gave an example that the preference for spicy foods in certain cultures was based on the protective effect of spices against microbes and food borne illness. What’s sad is that our food instincts or preferences do not seem to be keeping us safe anymore. Instead of detecting artificial or extreme tastes we are now conditioned to enjoy them. I mean, do you get more “poisonous” than diet soda?', 'So, think for a second, if you have been drinking let’s say whiskey or vodka since you were a child, whenever you drink a glass of water or anything else the taste of it will be bland and boring. The same thing happens with food. If you are used to have sugary, fatty or salty food, and someone asked you to try a broccoli your first reaction would be “I do NOT like it”, and find it “tasteless” or that it is missing something, right? Or think that real and fresh food taste like junk, when it is actually the other way around.', 'A picky eater’s discerning palate can be explained by a more acute sensitivity to bitterness. Bitterness is a major area of study involved in genetic taste traits. Those with less-intense taste receptors (or less taste buds) tend to eat more cruciferous vegetables. Their sense of flavor is somewhat muted so they fork through broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts more readily. Foods that impart bitterness tend to contain phytochemicals associated with health benefits. Subsequently, health perks follow, which include a reduced risk of chronic diseases.']"
why does organic and recycled stuff cost me twice as much or more than inorganic or non-recycled stuff?,"Organic and recycled stuff typically cost more than inorganic or non-recycled stuff because the farming costs required by organic methods can be higher[2]. Additionally, plastics are usually recycled once or twice and then no more[1], and because of the glut of natural gas and the resulting boom in U.S. petrochemical production, virgin plastic is now cheaper than recycled plastic[3]. Also, there is a very small resale market for the properly sorted items, especially recycled plastics[4], which contributes to the higher cost. On the other hand, metals have an unlimited lifespan and can be recycled for money, which may make them a bit more affordable.","['So once that item made from recycled plastic item is no longer wanted, it will likely end up in a landfill. There, it will eventually break down into microplastics that will just sit there for eternity — or worse, leach out into the environment. So the next time you think it’s fine to buy plastics because they can be recycled, remember they’re usually recycled once or twice and then no more.', 'Consumers pay considerably more for organic. In 2018, the Food Marketing Institute reported that the average retail price (by volume) for organic produce was 54 percent higher than for conventional produce. One USDA study showed that organic salad mix cost 60 percent more than conventional; organic milk 72 percent more; and organic eggs 82 percent more. Organic corn and soybeans sell for twice as much as conventional. These are high premiums, but not high enough to move most farmers toward organic, because the farming costs required by organic methods can be higher still.', 'Although companies that make and sell plastic push the idea that recycling is the answer to the plastic pollution problem, six times more plastic waste is incinerated than is recycled. The CEO of Recology, a company that collects and processes municipal solid waste, wrote in a 2018 op-ed, “The simple fact is, there is just too much plastic—and too many different types of plastics being produced; and there exist few, if any, viable end markets for the material.” Moreover, because of the glut of natural gas and the resulting boom in U.S. petrochemical production, virgin plastic is now cheaper than recycled plastic.', 'Nope. The problem is the tiny resale market for the properly sorted items, not the issue of sortation.

What it means a bank stops participating in market speculation on basic food prices.,"When a bank stops participating in market speculation on basic food prices, it means the bank is no longer engaging in speculation of commodities such as wheat, maize and soy with the aim of profiting from changes in food prices[3]. This type of speculation can cause price swings in staple foods, leading to increased poverty or even famine in some cases, and is linked to the financial crisis of 2007 and the Spring uprising in North African and Middle-Eastern countries in 2009[3][5]. As a result, G7 countries and the EU have committed to putting an end to food speculation[5].","['""Since the publication of the foodwatch report “The Hunger-Makers” in October 2011, foodwatch has demanded that banks cease all speculative trading with soft commodities in order to eliminate the risk of speculation-related food price spikes. With  Commerzbank , Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW),  Landesbank Berlin (LBB), DekaBank of the Sparkassen and now DZ Bank and Union Investment, the list of banks abandoning food speculation is getting longer and longer. On the other hand,  Deutsche Bank , Germany’s largest player in this field, announced their decision at the start of the year to continue distributing products that speculate on the price development of soft commodities.', 'There are signs some banks are listening to arguments that food price speculation harms millions of people.', 'Food speculation refers to the buying and selling of futures contracts by traders with the aim of profiting from changes in food prices.

Food speculation by global players like banks, hedge funds or pension funds is alleged to cause price swings in staple foods such as wheat, maize and soy – even though too large price swings in an idealized economy are theoretically ruled out: Adam Smith in 1776 reasoned that the only way to make money from commodities trading is by buying low and selling high, which has the effect of smoothing out price swings and mitigating shortages. For the actors, the apparently random swings are predictable, which means potential huge profits. For the global poor, food speculation and resulting price peaks may result in increased poverty or even famine.', 'Food speculation is driving the wild increase in food prices. Food speculators bet on food prices by buying futures contracts from farmers. They don’t actually want to buy the food, of course – they’re gambling that prices will go up and they will be able to sell on the contract and make a quick buck. In situations of crisis and market instability – like now, with Putin’s war in Ukraine – they act as hunger and war profiteers.', 'Speculation was already at the heart of the financial crisis of 2007 which led to a food crisis a year later. Experts consider this one of the major causes of the Spring uprising in North African and Middle-Eastern countries. Following this, in 2009, the G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US) and the EU all committed to putting an end to food speculation. Legislators have adopted some rules since then, such as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFiD) in the EU or the Dodd-Franck Act in the US.']"
How do animals not get frost bite.,"Animals are able to avoid frostbite by having thick fur coats, which can protect them from the cold temperatures[3]. Additionally, pet owners can help prevent frostbite by limiting their pet's outdoor activities in the colder months, dressing them in warm clothing, and making sure their fur is dry before going outside[5]. If an animal is showing signs of frostbite, it is important to cover the affected areas with a warm dry towel or blanket[2]. It is also important to seek treatment with a veterinarian as soon as possible[2], as frostbite can be painful and can lead to tissue damage and hypothermia[3][4].","['Wildlife animals that spend their time outdoors in the winter cannot avoid the frigid temperatures that come with the season. For animals that spend the winter outdoors, contact with the icy ground and falling snow are unavoidable. So how do they survive without suffering from things like hypothermia and frostbite? Well, some of these animals have a special secret hidden in their biological makeup.', 'Immediately cover the affected areas with a warm dry towel or blanket if you notice clinical frostbite signs in your pet. Frostbitten skin will become red and swollen as it begins to thaw and the blood returns to the affected tissues. However, seek treatment with your family veterinarian immediately if the skin becomes dark or bring your pet to Animal Emergency Care if it is after hours. A veterinary exam is important, while not an emergency unless your pet’s skin is dark or black, to ensure your pet does not have any long-term effects that may need treatment. Frostbite is painful to most pets, and medication may be needed to reduce discomfort. Also, depending on the severity of your pet’s frostbite, the following treatments may be recommended:', 'Frostbite can occur when pets are exposed to cold temperatures for extended periods of time. As in humans, prolonged exposure will cause an animal’s blood vessels to constrict to redirect blood from the extremities to warm and protect the vital organs including the brain, lungs and heart. Your pet’s nose, tail, ears, and paws are most susceptible to tissue damage because of this protective reaction. Cold weather breeds, including Siberian huskies and Alaskan malamutes, are less prone to frostbite because they have thick fur coats. However, all animals are at risk of developing frostbite with some pets at increased risk. These include:', 'Although rarely life-threatening, frostbite is often a precursor to hypothermia which can be fatal in some cases. Frostbite’s effect can be difficult to detect on pets and may take days to appear, so ensure you check your pet’s foot pads and other extremities if they have been outside in the cold. Changes in the appearance of your pet’s skin may indicate that the tissue is frostbitten which could result in tissue damage and potential loss of the affected body part. If your pet has been exposed to frigid temperatures, monitor them closely for the following signs:', 'The best way to prevent frostbite is to limit your pet’s outdoor activities in the colder months to avoid exposure to frigid temperatures. Consider dressing them in a sweater or jacket to keep their main body warm and dog boots to help ensure their paws keep warm and dry before taking your pet out for walks or bathroom breaks. Additionally, ensure your pet’s fur is dry before going outside to prevent their body temperature from quickly dropping and keep them away from any body of water.']"
Why is it important for humans to make an attempt to keep other species from extinction if all species come to extinction eventually?,"It is important for humans to make an attempt to keep other species from extinction because all species are connected in a web of life, meaning that even the most tolerant species will ultimately succumb to extinction when the less-tolerant species on which they depend disappear[1]. Endangered species are important as their absence can cause a break in the food chain or break synergies with other species, and thus a negative impact on them[2]. Additionally, 99 percent of currently threatened species are at risk from human activities, primarily those driving habitat loss, introduction of exotic species, and global warming[3]. When a species goes extinct, there are tangible consequences such as crop pollination and water purification, but also spiritual and cultural ones[4]. Furthermore, the loss of apex species, which are large predators at the top of the food chain, may be humans’ most serious impact on nature as they are more vulnerable because they live longer, reproduce more slowly, have small populations, and need more food and a greater habitat area[5].","['A recent study found that extreme environmental change could trigger an “extinction domino effect.” One of the study’s authors said, “Because all species are connected in the web of life, our paper demonstrates that even the most tolerant species ultimately succumb to extinction when the less-tolerant species on which they depend disappear.” So saving one species means saving its habitat and the other species that live there too.', 'Endangered species are important.

Because the rate of change in our biosphere is increasing, and because every species' extinction potentially leads to the extinction of others bound to that species in a complex ecological web, numbers of extinctions are likely to snowball in the coming decades as ecosystems unravel."", 'Each time a species goes extinct, the world around us unravels a bit.

"What would be the environmental impact if everyone who drank cow milk switched over to vegan milk (coconut, almond, cashew, etc)?","Switching from cow's milk to vegan milk, such as coconut, almond, cashew, etc., would have a positive environmental impact. Plant-based milks result in significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and freshwater use than cow's milk, according to a study from the University of Oxford. Cow's milk causes around three times as much greenhouse gas emissions; uses around ten times as much land; two to twenty times as much freshwater; and creates much higher levels of eutrophication than plant-based milks[4]. The specific plant-based milk that is best depends on the impact we care most about.

Why do people say radio waves are harmfull to the human brain if it has a lower frequency than visible light?,"Radio waves have a lower frequency than visible light, but they still have the potential to be harmful. This is because RF radiation, which includes radio waves and microwaves, is a type of non-ionizing radiation, meaning it does not have enough energy to remove electrons from an atom[3]. Studies have shown that exposure to high levels of nonionizing energy can damage the structure and function of the nervous system[1], and the World Health Organization has designated mobile phone RF-EMFs as possibly carcinogenic to humans[4]. Most people are exposed to lower levels of RF radiation every day from RF signals all around us[5], which can have an impact on the human brain.","['Evidence of health effects from EMF, including their influence on the brain, is inconclusive, and the probability that EMF exposure is a genuine health hazard is currently small. Nevertheless, exposure to high levels of nonionizing energy, such as at radio wave frequencies, can damage the structure and function of the nervous system. For example, microwave frequencies below 3,000 megahertz can penetrate the outer layers of the skin, be absorbed in the underlying tissues, and result in all of the known biological effects of heating, including burns, cataracts, and possibly death. Indeed, government regulators set most exposure limits to ensure that the amount of tissue heated by the absorption of energy is not in excess of what the body can take.', 'Researchers typically differentiate between the effects of ionizing radiation (such as far-ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma ray) and nonionizing radiation (including visible light, microwave and radio). The ionizing variety may be undesirable because it can cause DNA damage and mutations, thus we should all limit our exposure to its sources--radioactive materials and solar radiation among them. However, given modern technology, nonionizing radiation from power lines, personal wireless devices, cell phone towers and other sources is practically unavoidable. Extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (EMF) surround home appliances as well as high-voltage electrical transmission lines and transformers.', 'Radiofrequency (RF) radiation, which includes radio waves and microwaves, is at the low-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is a type of non-ionizing radiation. Non-ionizing radiation does not have enough energy to remove electrons from an atom.

Why do animals kill those of their own species if their one goal is to breed and prevent the species from extinction?,"Animals sometimes kill those of their own species if their one goal is to breed and prevent the species from extinction due to habitat loss, hunting and fishing, pollution, and climate change[4]. These threats are usually caused by humans and their expanding footprint[4]. Captive breeding programs have been successful in some cases in order to prevent extinction and increase population numbers[5].","['make the world a more interesting and beautiful place. More importantly, all living species, including people, depend on other species for survival. For example, if a fish such as the shortnose sturgeon becomes extinct, all of the species that rely on it will also suffer and may become threatened or endangered.', 'Species disappear because of changes to the earth that are caused either by nature or by the actions of people. Sometimes a natural event, like a volcano erupting, can kill an entire species. Other times, extinction will happen slowly as nature changes our world. For example, after the Ice Ages, when the glaciers melted and the earth became warmer, many species died because they could not live in a warmer climate. Newer species that could survive in a warmer environment took their places.', 'People can also cause the extinction of plants and animals. The main reason that many species are endangered or threatened today is because people have', 'Habitat loss—driven primarily by human expansion as we develop land for housing, agriculture, and commerce—is the biggest threat facing most animal species, followed by hunting and fishing. Even when habitat is not lost entirely, it may be changed so much that animals cannot adapt. Fences fragment a grassland or logging cuts through a forest, breaking up migration corridors; pollution renders a river toxic; pesticides kill widely and indiscriminately. To those local threats one must increasingly add global ones: Trade, which spreads disease and invasive species from place to place, and climate change, which eventually will affect every species on Earth—starting with the animals that live on cool mountaintops or depend on polar ice. All of these threats lead, directly or indirectly, back to humans and our expanding footprint. Most species face multiple threats. Some can adapt to us; others will vanish.', ""Some species in danger of extinction in the wild are brought into captivity to either safeguard against imminent extinction or to increase population numbers. The primary goals of captive breeding programs are to establish populations via controlled breeding that are: a) large enough to be demographically stable; and b) genetically healthy (Ebenhard 1995). These objectives ensure that populations will exhibit a healthy age structure, resistance to disease, consistent reproduction, and preservation of the gene pool to minimize and/or avoid problems associated with inbreeding. Successful captive breeding programs include those for the Guam rail, scimitar-horned oryx, and Przewalski's horse. (See iucnredlist.org for details.)""]"
"If 20-40% of adults are lactose intolerant, why don't any ice cream parlors or chains have even one flavor of lactase-supplemented ice cream?","Lactose intolerance affects up to 50 million Americans and up to 68% of the global population[1]. It occurs when there is a shortage of lactase in the body, which is an enzyme produced by the small intestine to digest lactose[4]. People with severe lactose intolerance cannot digest any lactose and will have to remove all dairy and dairy-derivative ingredients from their diet[5]. Therefore, it is likely that most ice cream parlors and chains do not provide lactase-supplemented ice cream because it is not necessarily a popular demand, and it is not suitable for people with severe lactose intolerance.","['According to the National Institutes of Health, between 30 and 50 million Americans suffer from lactose intolerance.

The state of the sunni/shiite conflict in Iraq while Saddam Hussein was still in power compared to what is happening right now.,"Under Saddam Hussein, the Sunni/Shiite conflict in Iraq was primarily about how to share power in a 21st century state and was fueled by Saddam's decision to invade an oil-rich province in Iran. Sunnis had traditionally been the political masters in Iraq and were more likely to view state collapse as an existential crisis, while Shias viewed the state as an oppressive apparatus and saw state collapse as liberation[3]. After the United States-led coalition invaded and ended Saddam's regime, the conflict shifted to a fight for power rather than doctrinal differences between Sunnis and Shiites[4]. This was further exacerbated by foreign Sunni militants affiliated with al-Qaeda and the growth of Iranian influence in Iraq[5].","['""The Iraq conflict plays out on several levels between Sunnis and Shiites. First and foremost, it\'s about how to share power in a 21st century state.

The move sparks an eight-year war, resulting in roughly one million deaths. Iraq is backed by Saudi Arabia and the United States, the latter responding to hostility from Tehran’s new government following the Islamic revolution and taking hostage of U.S. diplomats.', 'The issues of Shia-centric state building, Sunni rejection, and, more broadly, Iraq’s Sunni-Shia issue are at heart inseparable from questions of state legitimacy. This is best illustrated in the parallels between the reactions to impending state collapse in 2003 and 2014. In 2003, Shias were, broadly speaking, more receptive to the idea of regime change than their Sunni compatriots. The reason was not that Sunnis were pro–Saddam Hussein; rather, it was that some Sunnis accorded the state structure some measure of legitimacy regardless of their views on Saddam. Conversely, many Shias accorded the state no legitimacy whatsoever, viewing it as an oppressive apparatus that targeted them as a sectarian group. As such, Shias were more likely to view state collapse in 2003 as Iraq’s, and particularly Shia Iraqis’, chance to be liberated from tyranny, while Sunnis were more likely to view state collapse as an existential crisis.', '""I don\'t necessarily think there\'s a one-to-one correlation between the historic doctrinal differences and what is happening in Iraq right now,"" said Haider Ala Hamoudi, an associate professor of law at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, who teaches on Islamic law. The fighting now, he said, arose more over a fight for power than the variations in beliefs held by Sunnis and Shiites.', 'A coalition led by the United States invades Iraq and ends Saddam’s regime and centuries of Sunni dominance in Iraq. Sectarian violence erupts as remnants of the deposed Ba’ath party and other Sunnis, both secular and Islamist, mount a resistance against coalition forces and their local allies, the ascendant Shiite community. Shiite militias also emerge, some of which also oppose the U.S. military presence. Foreign Sunni militants, many affiliated with al-Qaeda, flock to Iraq to participate in what evolves into a sectarian war. Iranian influence in Iraq grows dramatically as Tehran backs Shiite militants, as well as the Shiite political parties that come to dominate the electoral process.']"
Why do fruits such as apples  &  avocados brown once broken into?,"Fruits such as apples and avocados turn brown once broken into due to enzymatic browning. This is caused by an enzyme in the fruit combining with phenols and oxygen, creating a brown pigment called melanin. This reaction is also responsible for bruises in fruit[4]. In avocados specifically, the enzyme polyphenol oxidase reacts with oxygen to form quinones, which then create polyphenols, resulting in browning[1].","['Avocados appear to be a much different fruit compared to apples, but Compound Interest explains how the browning occurs in a similar way. In avocados, the enzyme polyphenol oxidase, once in contact with oxygen, helps quinones form polyphenols. The polyphenols are the mechanism that causes the brown color.', 'After reading your blog I instantly became interested in why fruits turn brown. I know there has been many times in my life where I went to grab an apple, banana or leftover guacamole and was immediately disturbed when I saw the brown color. Personally I think the freshness and color of a fruit makes me crave fruit over ordinary food . After reading this article http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/explainer/2013/01/bruised_fruit_is_it_safe_to_eat.html, I learned bruised fruit isn’t necessary healthy because the cell walls are broken which allows nutrients to exit the fruit. When the microbes enter the fruit and turn it brown it can cause salmonella and E-coli which are some dangerous diseases. I wish you extended your blog and talked about why other fruits bruise and turn brown', '[…] it opens up the chances of your delicious fruit turning brown. Why is that? Well, there is an enzyme in avocado that causes it to oxidize when it’s exposed to air, causing it to turn brown rather quickly. […]', 'It’s the curse of the sluggish apple eater—brown apples. We’ve all been there; you leave a few apple slices out too long, or take too long to eat your way around an apple, and you’re confronted with an unpleasant sight. Your once crispy, juicy white apple has turned a dismal shade of brown. Not very appetizing. The good news is that a brown apple is perfectly safe to eat. The bad news is that it’s ugly. The cause is enzymatic browning, a molecular reaction that occurs when certain enzymes and a class of chemicals known as phenolic compounds, or phenols, naturally found in some plants combine and react in the presence of oxygen. One of the products of their chemical reaction is a brown pigments called melanin. And it’s not only apples that are susceptible to this phenomenon. Pears, bananas, avocados, eggplants and potatoes can also undergo enzymatic browning, because they, like apples, contain phenols. Fun fact: Bruises in fruit are caused by the enzymatic browning too!', 'Typically, when naturally bright foods turn brown, it is bad news. Why does this not hold true for apples? According to Lynne McLandsborough, it all has to do with something in apples called o-quinones. Once an apple is cut and interacts with the air, certain enzymes oxidize compound that react with the o-quinones, which cause the brown color.']"

How is it that animals from different species can become such good friends?,"Animals from different species can become good friends through a variety of different ways. First, if animals are raised together from a young age, they may view each other as family and develop strong bonds[1]. Also, in captivity, animals may form strong attachments to one another as a form of comfort[1][5]. Additionally, animals that live in stable, bonded social groups are more likely to form strong friendships with other species[1][3], and inter-species adoption is rare in nature[2][4].","['So far, most of the interspecies relationships researchers have observed have happened in captivity—possibly because the probability of seeing one among zoo or household is just higher than happening upon it in the wild, but also because animals living in the world of humans are just more likely to interact with other species from a young age. There’s a reason so much of the Internet’s interspecies-friendship porn focuses on baby animals: The strongest bonds form early. Studies have shown that geese and ducks raised together will view each other as members of the same family; kittens raised with baby rats would never harm them. If a relationship takes root early enough in an animal’s social development, it can overrule instinct or later learned behavior. (The San Diego Zoo assigns “puppy buddies” to each of its cheetahs from birth, to help the cats learn to be more playful, and other zoos have similar programs.)', 'Another example of unusual inter species-friendship is that of Moo Moo the dairy cow and Lucy the pig. The pair can be found at Happy Herd Farm Sanctuary in Aldergrove, British Columbia.', 'MOST animals have acquaintances but only a few species are capable of true friendship. This select group of mammals includes the higher primates, members of the horse family, elephants, cetaceans and camelids. It is no coincidence that all of these animals live in stable, bonded social groups. Group living has its benefits, but it can also be stressful and you cannot simply leave when the going gets tough – which is where friendship comes in. Friends form defensive coalitions that keep everyone else just far enough away, without driving them off completely.', 'You might have heard of animals of one species becoming friends with another - like dogs and cats, or a bird and a dog but inter-species ADOPTION is really rare in nature.', 'Strong attachments often arise in captive animals, says Bonnie Beaver of Texas A&M’s College of Veterinary Medicine. “Two very stressed individuals may lean on each other for comfort.” In most cases, cross-species friendships are forged most strongly when animals are young. But in captivity even an older captured animal might seek out a friend, including a member of another species.']"

Why do people in the United States still talk about slavery ? my country of Mexico was conquered and the people enslaved for hundreds of years by the Spanish and no one talks about it except in history classes,"People in the United States still talk about slavery because, although Mexico was conquered and the people enslaved for hundreds of years by the Spanish, the United States was a powerful, slaveholding nation and Mexico could stand upright before the civilized world for its anti-slavery positions[2].

"How do Sheep get overgrown, to the point where health issues arise?","Sheep can get overgrown, to the point where health issues arise, if they are not sheared regularly. Without shearing, the wool can become so thick that it can impair the sheep's vision[3] and cause ""wool blindness""[3][5]. It can also become so heavy that the sheep have trouble walking or running, and their ability to graze is compromised[3]. It can even prevent lambs from being able to find their mother's teats to nurse[3]. Shearing is essential to identifying health issues such as mites, maggots, and other pests before they become worse[4]. It also helps prevent overheating and parasitic infestations such as ticks, lice, mites, and fly strike[5].","['An overgrown coat doesn’t just impact the sheep at the centre of it all. Should the sheep bear lambs, they too can be affected by the problems that come with a thick wool coat.', 'Overgrown wool on the face can cause the sheep’s vision to be impaired too, which is particularly dangerous in any outdoor setting.', 'Without shearing, overgrown wool can even develop into “wool blindness” which is a condition that impairs the animal’s sight —and because sheep are prey animals, their sight is necessary for survival. If shearing is neglected, sheep become so heavy with wool that they have trouble walking or running, their ability to graze becomes compromised, and they cannot keep up with the flock for protection, or run from predators. Shearing is also critical to the survival of lambs, particularly in longwool breeds whose lambs need to quickly find their mother’s teats to nurse — sadly, lambs can die of starvation when there is too much wool in the way.', 'Shearing is vital to ensuring a healthy, happy sheep. Shearing allows farmers to successfully identify any health issues — before they become more serious and often fatal problems. Mites, maggots, and other pests can harm sheep — causing infestations and injuries that would be hidden from view if the sheep’s coat was overgrown.', 'Shearing is crucial to sheep’s health, as a large animal veterinarian will tell you. Dr. Jen Burton, a vet with 10 years of experience specializing in the health and welfare of sustainable livestock, explains “I can’t imagine a veterinarian suggesting that wool be left to grow on a domestic sheep, because that would put the animal at risk for overheating, discomfort and disease. The animal would also be at increased risk for skin disease and parasites. Over time, unshorn wool could eventually impede movement.” Sheep can overheat and die in the summer months if not shorn, and become the target for parasitic species such as ticks, lice, mites, and the maggots that cause fly strike, a gruesome and even deadly condition. Shearing provides both prevention and treatment of any of these infestations.']"
"Why do mosquitoes crop up seasonally each spring? Is it a more ""fit"" group each year that is more adapted for colder weather, or does natural selection not apply?","Mosquitoes crop up seasonally each spring because they are genetically programmed to hibernate until the days become shorter and the weather warms up. Mild winter weather can affect insect populations, as it can be beneficial for insects that overwinter below ground, as soil temperatures are more constant than air temperatures[2], but can be detrimental for insects that overwinter above ground, as there is a lack of protective snow cover[2]. Additionally, climate change has been causing some species, such as the Asian tiger mosquito and the water strider, to shift their hibernation periods[3]. Natural selection does apply, as a 2001 study showed that the genetic changes responsible for the shift can manifest in as little as five years[3], and a study of 833 great tits found greater genetic selection for birds that could vary their egg-laying time to match the caterpillars' arrival[4]. However, it is unclear if animals can adapt quickly enough to rising temperatures[4]. Additionally, warm winter days can cause some insects to become active when they should be dormant, using up stored fats they depend on to survive until spring[5].","['In the bogs of eastern North America, the larvae of pitcher plant mosquitoes (Wyeomyia smithii) hibernate in winter and blossom into fully grown adults come spring, when they thrive on the nectar inside their namesake plants. As the days grow shorter, the mosquitoes are genetically programmed to hibernate. Mosquitos at the southern end of the species’ range had already adapted to delay hibernation based on the longer growing season. But now northern populations are also hibernating later as global temperatures rise.', ""One might think that relatively warm weather would favor insect survival. However, many factors contribute to insect population dynamics. Spring and summer weather patterns, an abundance of an insect's natural enemies, and crop growth and development each influence insect populations as much as winter weather does. For insects that overwinter above ground, mild winter weather could actually increase death rates due to a lack of insulating snow cover to protect the insects on days when temperatures drop below freezing. In contrast, insects that overwinter below ground — such as Japanese beetle grubs, which can overwinter up to 10 inches deep in the soil — will not likely be affected by a mild winter because soil temperatures are more constant than air temperatures."", 'A 2001 study in PNAS showed that the genetic changes responsible for the shift can manifest in as little as five years, according to lab tests. In areas where the selection pressures are stronger, the change in hibernation behavior can happen even faster. Other studies hint that the Asian tiger mosquito, a carrier of West Nile virus, and the water strider are experiencing similar shifts in hibernation periods based on seasonal impacts of climate change.', ""Sometimes organisms are slow to adapt. In Holland’s Hoge Veluwe Park, caterpillars are maturing earlier each year as spring comes earlier. But their predators, great tits (Parus major), aren’t always changing their schedule to hatch when the caterpillars are at their peak, and bird numbers are dropping. As with the hibernating mosquitoes, great tits have a genetic trigger that spurs them to lay eggs when spring arrives. But there’s some variation in how much an individual bird can tweak its egg-laying date in response to an earlier spring. A study of 833 great tits in Hoge Veluwe over 32 years did find greater genetic selection for birds that could vary their egg-laying time to match the caterpillars' arrival. If this trend continues, it could save them from decline, but it remains unclear whether they can change fast enough to beat rising temperatures."", ""Another factor to consider is that insects develop based on the air temperature in their surroundings. A warm winter day could cause some insects, such as woolly bear caterpillars, to become active when they normally should be dormant. This activity uses up stored fats they depend on to survive until spring. And because they won't have access to food during winter, these active insects could starve to death before food does become available.""]"
Animals getting saved from extinction.,"Since the early 1990s, conservation efforts have resulted in saving at least 48 mammals and birds from extinction[2], including the American bison, bald eagle, and Przewalski's horse.

American bison (Bison bison). Among the animals saved from extinction this species also stands out, which, even though today they number some 500,000 — only between 11,000 and 13,000 in the wild —, declined from 40 million to less than a thousand in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of hunting.', 'Efforts to conserve species have resulted in saving at least 48 mammals and birds from extinction since the early 1990s.

In the United States, breeders are not required to dock the tails of puppies in their care, although some breeders choose to do so[5].","['Tails have been docked for many reasons in the past – for example, by the Romans to prevent rabies (they thought rabies was caused by worms that lived in the tail), and in the 18th century to avoid a tax on dogs with tails.', 'Cosmetics is the most common reason for docking tails. A docked tail became a breed standard for one historical reason or another and makes the dog recognizable as that breed.

Although rooted in necessity historically, nowadays, this procedure is often only a cosmetic procedure. As a result, many groups advocate for its ban. Furthermore, many veterinarians have discontinued the practice because of ethical implications. Many countries have already banned the practice.

"Why the word ""drink"" being more associated with drinking alcohol beverages rather than any other drinks?","The word ""drink"" is more commonly associated with drinking alcohol beverages because of its prevalence in different cultures. Alcohol consumption is a social role in many cultures, and it is also regulated by laws in most countries[1]. Research has found that men consume significantly more alcohol than women[2], and that those in lower-income or educational status groups are more likely to have lower-frequency, higher-intensity drinking patterns[3][4]. However, when looking at consumption data within given countries, there is often a correlation between income and alcohol consumption, where those with higher incomes tend to drink more frequently[4]. Additionally, research has found that Black study participants consume significantly less alcohol than White study participants[5].","['An alcoholic beverage (also called an alcoholic drink, adult beverage, or a drink) is a drink that contains ethanol, a type of alcohol that acts as a drug and is produced by fermentation of grains, fruits, or other sources of sugar. The consumption of alcoholic drinks, often referred to as ""drinking"", plays an important social role in many cultures. Most countries have laws regulating the production, sale, and consumption of alcoholic beverages. Regulations may require the labeling of the percentage alcohol content (as ABV or proof) and the use of a warning label. Some countries ban such activities entirely, but alcoholic drinks are legal in most parts of the world. The global alcoholic drink industry exceeded $1 trillion in 2018.', 'Table 1 displays the gender differences which were found in alcohol consumption and reasons for drinking alcohol. As found in past research (Cahalan et al., 1969; Clark & Midanik, 1982; NIDA, 1988), men consumed significantly more alcohol than did women, as indicated by all five alcohol consumption indicators. Men also reported that both coping and social motives for drinking were more important to them than did women.', 'However, we also find correlates in drinking patterns when we look at groupings of income, education or work status.

Taking 2016 data in the UK as an example we see that people within higher income brackets tend to drink more frequently. This correlation is also likely to be influenced by other lifestyle determinants and habits; the UK ONS also report that when grouped by education status, those with a university tend to drink more in total and more frequently than those of lower education status. There are also differences when grouped by profession: individuals in managerial or professional positions tend to drink more frequently than those in intermediate or manual labour roles.6', 'Table 2 displays the ethnic differences which were found in alcohol consumption and reasons for drinking alcohol.

Why does it seem like most animals run away from humans but are fine being around all other animals?,"Wild animals run away from humans because they perceive humans as predators and respond as they would to any other predator[3]. This is due to a learned behavior of wariness of humans. However, if the human-animal interactions are mostly benign, and if the animals can tolerate people, larger species eventually learn that people are not very threatening[4]. The extent to which animals become more tolerant of humans’ presence is largely driven by the type of environment in which the animals live and by the animal’s body size[5].","['Although many wildlife appear tame, they are not. It’s best to resist the urge to pet and hold them. In fact, some animals, from bison to birds, may be rejected by their parents if they have contact with humans, making them more vulnerable to predators or other harmful situations. In addition, wildlife can get injured when they try to escape people who have gotten too close, especially if they are near human structures or roads. Wildlife that get used to being around people and developed areas such as picnic areas and campgrounds also are at greater risk of eating human food and catching diseases from people and pets or giving diseases to humans and their pets.', 'Predators living in other areas that are heavily populated by humans have faced similar problems. According to Suraci, the animals that have escaped human menace likely learned to become wary of our species.

"How come there are brands of beer and liquor that are universally known and widely consumed, but no such brand exists for wine?","There are several reasons why there are widely consumed brands of beer and liquor, but not for wine. Firstly, the Federal tax code and the tax codes of individual States classify beverages as “beer”, “wine”, or “distilled spirits” based on their alcohol content[1]. Secondly, non-alcoholic beer and wine are regulated whereas non-alcoholic spirit-like products are not[2]. Furthermore, beer and wine have been consumed for centuries for various purposes, such as pleasure, nutrition, medicine, ritual, remuneration, and funerary purposes[3]. Beer was popular in Ancient Rome, and rum was widely consumed in the US colonies in the 1700s[4][5]. On the other hand, there is no single wine that is universally known and widely consumed.","['In the United States, both the Federal tax code and the tax codes of individual States specify which beverages are classified as “ beer,” “ wine,” or “distilled spirits” and their alcohol content. According to those definitions, “ beer” includes strong beer (i.e., beer with an alcohol content greater than 3.2 percent), beer with an alcohol content of up to 3.2 percent, ale, malt liquor, and similar types of beverages. Similarly, “ wine” encompasses wine, vermouth, champagne, sparkling wine, cider, and related beverages. The broadest category is that of “distilled spirits,” which includes numerous beverages, such as gin, rum, vodka, whiskey, scotch, bourbon, and premixed cocktails.', 'While non-alcoholic beer and wine, as beverages resulting from the dealcoholization of their full-strength counterparts, are definable and regulated, there are no comparable standards in the production and marketing of spirit-like, non-alcoholic products. Many never involve the production of alcohol; they are made by simply adding aromas to a neutral, non-alcoholic base liquid and are designed to mimic the flavor profile of full-strength spirit categories such as gin and whisky. Lyre’s products, for instance, result from the addition of natural essences and extracts to a proprietary non-alcoholic liquid. Others, such as Spiritless, do involve distillation and dealcoholization processes and are designed to replace actual spirits in non-alcoholic cocktails, yet they cannot be labeled as the full-strength category they take inspiration from. Some would even argue that non-alcoholic spirits don’t actually exist.', 'Both beer and wine were deified and offered to gods. Cellars and wine presses even had a god whose hieroglyph was a winepress. The ancient Egyptians made at least 17 types of beer and at least 24 varieties of wine. The most common type of beer was known as hqt. Beer was the drink of common laborers; financial accounts report that the Giza pyramid builders were allotted a daily beer ration of one and one-third gallons. Alcoholic beverages were used for pleasure, nutrition, medicine, ritual, remuneration, and funerary purposes. The latter involved storing the beverages in tombs of the deceased for their use in the after-life.', 'Though beer was drunk in Ancient Rome, it was replaced in popularity by wine. Tacitus wrote disparagingly of the beer brewed by the Germanic peoples of his day. Thracians were also known to consume beer made from rye, even since the 5th century BC, as the ancient Greek logographer Hellanicus of Lesbos says. Their name for beer was brutos, or brytos. The Romans called their brew cerevisia, from the Celtic word for it. Beer was apparently enjoyed by some Roman legionaries. For instance, among the Vindolanda tablets (from Vindolanda in Roman Britain, dated c. 97–103 AD), the cavalry decurion Masculus wrote a letter to prefect Flavius Cerialis inquiring about the exact instructions for his men for the following day. This included a polite request for beer to be sent to the garrison (which had entirely consumed its previous stock of beer).', 'Almost every important town from Massachusetts to the Carolinas had a rum distillery to meet the local demand, which had increased dramatically. Rum was often enjoyed in mixed drinks, including flip. This was a popular winter beverage made of rum and beer sweetened with sugar and warmed by plunging a red-hot fireplace poker into the serving mug. Alcohol was viewed positively while its excessive use was condemned. Increase Mather (d. 1723) expressed the common view in a sermon against drunkenness: ""Drink is in itself a good creature of God, and to be received with thankfulness, but the abuse of drink is from Satan; the wine is from God, but the drunkard is from the Devil.""']"
Why aren't we only using wind and solar energy?,"Wind and solar energy are not the only solution to addressing climate change due to a variety of factors. One is that the production of panels and turbines require a large amount of energy and resources, which generate more carbon dioxide than they offset[1]. Additionally, solar and wind are not always available when energy is needed, as sunlight is only available during the day and wind is usually seasonally variable and not always blowing when needed[2]. Furthermore, these sources of energy are inherently unreliable and energy-dilute[4], which increases the cost of generating electricity, locks in fossil fuels, and increases the environmental footprint of energy production[4]. Consequently, solar and wind may not be the only solution to address climate change.","['The myth is that wind and solar always and everywhere reduce carbon dioxide gas emissions. Not so. Simply because of the extensive range and colossal volume of mineral resources, and tremendous volumes of energy, that are used and combined to create panels and turbines. Processes which generate far more carbon oxide gas than will ever be offset by the occasional generation of wind and solar power. Bearing in mind the need for fossil-fuelled power sources to be running constantly in the background, ready to fill the gaps whenever the sun sets and/or calm weather sets in.', 'November 7, 2016 — What’s keeping solar and wind power from fully taking over the electric grid? For starters, the sun only shines during the day. Wind blows intermittently, is seasonally variable, and is not always blowing when the energy is needed. But what if solar and wind work together? “Wind resource tends to complement solar resource,” says Sarah Kurtz of the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory. “Here in Colorado, for instance, the windiest time is during the winter and spring months. In winter, we don’t have as much sunshine, but we tend to get more wind and stronger wind.”', 'As such solar and wind aren’t just insufficient, they are also unnecessary for solving climate change.', 'Sunlight and wind are inherently unreliable and energy-dilute. As such, adding solar panels and wind turbines to the grid in large quantities increases the cost of generating electricity, locks in fossil fuels, and increases the environmental footprint of energy production.', 'For 30 years, experts have claimed that humankind needs to switch to solar and wind energy to address climate change. But do we really?']"
Why do most charities only want money instead of volunteers or make volunteers pay to volunteer?,"Charities often prefer money instead of volunteers or make volunteers pay to volunteer because they don't want to be seen as a second-choice option for those of less means[2][3], as well as to prevent donor fatigue from setting in[3]. Additionally, relying on money instead of volunteers perpetuates the belief that money can solve everything, and may limit the vision and ambition of charities[4]. However, many volunteers give their time precisely because they don't have the spare cash to offer in donations[2][5], or they may have specific skills to offer an organization that would be cheaper than hiring a contractor[5]. Therefore, some charities have found a compromise by having volunteers fund-raise to cover the cost of the project they will be working on[5].","['Those who volunteer for nonprofits generally do not do so for the money; if they wanted money from their nonprofit efforts, they would become its employees. Instead, most volunteers labor because they believe in a given nonprofit’s mission. Beyond the mission, they may seek others’ gratitude for their selfless work, opportunities to work with or lead others, or perhaps community recognition.', 'This blog echoes precisely what I was discussing with colleagues just a few days ago, and also in a public debate last week. The power and value of volunteering is immense, yet always plays second (or maybe third or even fourth) fiddle to cash donations. This problem is so deeply ingrained in the sector that when I recently introduced myself as a volunteer manager at a conference I was met with derisory snorts of, ""volunteers can\'t be relied upon."" Charities are more than willing to sink massive financial resources into acquiring, securing and retaining cash donors, yet often spend little - if anything - supporting donations of time. I am left flabbergasted by the number of organisations that have an ideological stance that they will not pay for anything related to volunteering simply because, ""it\'s free.""', 'We are also concerned about the current financial climate. If all the public hears from charities and nonprofits is “we want your money,” there is a real risk that donor fatigue will settle in and the cash-strapped public will become increasingly resistant to the sector’s appeals for support. As volunteer recruiters, we don’t want to be seen as the second-choice option for those of less means.', 'Finally, as Rob notes in his Third Sector Online blog, perpetuating a belief that money can solve everything simply makes the voluntary sector more like the private sector. Already we see nonprofits cutting back on services because they can’t pay people to do the work they once did. Is that what we really want – charities that limit their vision and ambition because one resource available to them becomes harder to obtain?', ""Rarely is it the case of a straight either/or. Many volunteers give their time precisely because they don't have the spare cash to offer in donations. Or they may have specific skills to offer an organisation for free, which on a project basis would be far cheaper than hiring a contractor. John Lawler, chief executive of the Northumberland-based overseas gap year volunteering charity Madventurer, believes that a good compromise is to have volunteers fund-raise to cover the cost of the project that they will be working on.""]"
"Why is milk so popular for humans, even though among mammals, milk is only consumed when breastfeeding the young?","Milk has been a staple in human diets for thousands of years because it is uniquely designed to supply the needs of an infant mammal’s body, including the most complex organ, the brain[2]. While milk is consumed by other mammals when breastfeeding the young, humans were able to capture animals like goats and aurochs (ancestral cow breeds) and collect their milk in pottery vessels[5]. This raw milk provided a steady source of readily available food for ancient humans and was seen as a complete, nutritious food[5]. Cow’s milk is no match for the needs of a human infant brain and science has not been able to fully replicate human milk[2][3], which is why milk has remained so popular among humans.","['What about cow’s milk? Does the ubiquitous availability of cow’s milk for human consumption indicate a special compatibility of cow’s milk for humans or human babies? “Actually, in the mammalian order, says Hinde, “rats and humans share more recent common ancestors than cows and humans.” Anybody for rats milk? Cheers!', 'For 300 million years, milk has continued to evolve, to supply the needs of every organ in an infant mammal’s body, including the most complex organ, the brain. This evolutionary history makes it easier to understand why the human brain, still more sophisticated than any man-made technology and exponentially more complex than the next smartest animal brain, is only fully supported in its infant development by human milk. A human mother’s milk is equally as complex in comparison to the milk of all other mammals.', 'Cow’s milk is no match for the needs of a human infant brain, and so far science has not been able to reproduce the thousands of constituents necessary to create a formula that comes close to human milk. Hinde concludes: “Breast milk is food, medicine, and signal; it is the first food a baby has evolved to eat, and we do not know enough about it to replicate it.”', 'At that moment, milk began to evolve as a uniquely mammalian adaptation for providing protection and nutrients to offspring--long before the rise of the first known dinosaurs 230 million years ago. Mammals became distinguished by the unique ability of mothers to “liquefy their bodies to feed their young,” as Hinde now famously puts it. As a mother’s body has already adapted to the environment in which she is living, this liquefication passes on that adaptation in the form of sustenance, which enables the young of every species to grow, develop and thrive, regardless of the supply of food and clean water in the immediate environment.', 'People observed animals in the wild nursing their young just as they nursed their own young. By capturing goats and aurochs (ancestral cow breeds), the people were able to collect their milk in pottery vessels. These humans would have learned quickly that milk from other animals was a complete, nutritious food. Being purposely designed to sustain life like no other food, this raw milk provided a steady source of readily available food for ancient humans.']"
"Why are there so many Republican candidates, and only three Democratic candidates?","The Republican Party has had more candidates for the upcoming election because of the current political climate and the Republican Party's embrace of extremist ideologies[3][5]. Additionally, voters perceive the current slate of Republican candidates to be more extreme, and men are more likely to back the Republican candidate in their district than women[3][4]. Furthermore, there is unlikely to be any incorporation of moderate Republican candidates into the Republican Party, as the Trump phenomenon has transformed the Republican Party[5].","['Of course, not all of the far-right candidates supported by Democratic groups won their primary races — in fact, far from it. In September, an analysis by The Washington Post found that seven of 13 Democrat-backed Republican candidates lost their primaries after having more than a combined $12 million spent on their behalf.', 'We already have 23 states that have the so-called trifecta, which means that Republicans are in control of the governorship and both houses of the legislature, and, in some cases, the courts. We have another 13 states that are divided and there are some really tough gubernatorial races going on in places that were sites of experimentation with autocratic politics — Michigan, for example, and Pennsylvania and Arizona. The fate of those states is also going to set the stage for either an emboldened, antidemocratic electorate in the election’s aftermath or an enraged one. This is our fundamental crisis: The extremists among the GOP’s constituency are either going to be emboldened or enraged, and both of those are terrible outcomes, potentially, for our democracy. And the party’s leadership has completely, cynically, embraced either of those responses to maintain power in a way that is going to affect our democracy for a long time.', 'Voters also perceive the current slate of Republican candidates to be more extreme; when asked which party has nominated more extreme candidates, voters choose Republicans by a seven-point margin (44%-37%). Among swing voters, that margin was twenty points (36%-16%). Conversely, when asked which party has nominated the most moderate candidates for Congress this cycle, 34% chose Democrats while 25% chose Republicans. For Democratic candidates who overcome the headwinds in 2022, it will be because they were seen as mainstream, despite the baggage of their party brand, compared to their opponents who were extreme in the minds of swing voters.', 'Among all registered voters, more men support the Republican candidate (45%) than the Democratic candidate (39%), while women are somewhat more likely to back the Democratic candidate in their district (43%) over the GOP nominee (37%).', 'FUNG: It’s very unlikely that this Republican Party will incorporate the Liz Cheneys, Mitt Romneys, and the Jeff Flakes of the world anytime soon. Regardless of whether you think the Trump phenomenon is reproducible, it did happen and has transformed the Republican Party. So I think that’s not in the cards. Like Erica, I am in favor of moving the United States beyond the two-party system. We are an extreme outlier and only have two effective parties. I think that if we had more than two, then there would be a home for center-right Republicans. I think there should be a Jeff Flake-Liz Cheney party. There should be a Josh Hawley-Donald Trump party. There should be a Bernie-AOC party. And there should be a Joe Biden party, at least.']"
Why do dogs tend to lick people's faces when they get the chance?,"Dogs tend to lick people's faces when they get the chance because it is an instinct passed down through their DNA[1].

It may be in an attempt to appease the stranger so that the stranger does do anything harmful or threatening to the dog. When dogs lick the face of children, it can be a sign of affection, appeasement or simply the act of cleaning food residue off their face.', ""Canines tend to lick their owners’ faces or other dogs’ faces, to show their love and strong bond. The process of licking, similar to kissing and hugging by humans, releases endorphins, that make both sides feel more relaxed and happier.

"How can certain animals eat only one type food, like meat or grass,and be healthy while humans have to have such a diverse diet to get all the nutrition we require.","Humans have evolved to be able to eat a wide variety of food, including both meat and plants. This is because our bodies have a single compartment stomach which is better adapted to eating mixed, omnivorous diets[1]. Other animals, like lions, are strict carnivores, which means they only eat meat, and this provides all of their nutritional requirements[1]. Humans, however, need to eat a diverse diet of both animal and plant foods in order to get all the nutrition they require[1]. This is because, although our bodies can digest both meat and plants, there are certain plant parts that our bodies are not capable of digesting[3]. Additionally, we need to make sure we get enough protein, and sources of vitamin B12, which is naturally found mainly in animal foods[4].","['But not all animals have the same dietary requirements. In fact, across the animal kingdom there is huge variation in foods that are eaten. Many animals, like us, are omnivores, and are adapted to eating a combination of plants and meat-based foods. Big cats, such as lions, are one of many strict carnivores. This means they only eat meat, and this provides all of their nutritional requirements. Cows and sheep are herbivores, which means they get all of their nutrition from grasses, seeds and grains. Their digestive system is even specially adapted – their stomach has four separate compartments each with a different role, unlike our single compartment that is better adapted to eating a mixed, omnivorous diet.', 'Q Why is it that other animals can thrive on often a very limited range of foods in their diets, but we humans are required to eat such a wide range of foods to remain in good health?', 'Biologically, humans are capable of eating and digesting both meat and plants, though our bodies can’t digest certain plant parts.', 'A diverse diet doesn’t have to include animal foods; we can be healthy and well on vegetarian or vegan diets, too.

when will gas prices start to rise due to depleted resources oppose to just political and economical reasons it rises?,"Gas prices will start to rise due to depleted resources when fossil fuel companies have little motivation to expand their fossil fuel infrastructure and record-breaking prices have led to windfall profits for petroleum companies that are used to buy back their stock, raise share prices, and generate money for their investors[4].

From January to June, prices at the pump shot up by 50 percent to a record-breaking $5 per gallon, creating ripple effects across a range of consumer goods and contributing to the highest nationwide inflation in 40 years. While the cost of oil has dropped suddenly over the past couple weeks with gasoline following closely behind, experts acknowledge that there is no predicting where prices will go next.', 'In response to the jump in gasoline prices, President Biden has called on Congress to pass a federal gas tax holiday and for states to approve similar relief.

Combined with President Biden’s championing of biofuels, it could also adversely affect air quality by encouraging a surge in driving; however, Congress is not expected to authorize such assistance even along party lines (1, 2). This effort by the Biden-Harris administration clearly has little real-world positive impact.', 'Pandemic scarcity and the consequences of Russian sanctions have caught the U.S. in a delicate time of transition as the country begins moving from fossil fuels to a clean energy economy. Growing recognition of the climate crisis has marked fossil fuels as a “declining industry” (1, 2, 3, 4) of “stranded assets” (1, 2, 3), and petroleum companies therefore see little value in expanding fossil fuel infrastructure (e.g. reopening refineries). This lack of motivation is coupled with the fact that record-breaking prices have made fossil fuel companies and refineries windfall profits, which are in turn used to buy back their stock, raise share prices, and generate money for their investors (1, 2) (i.e. price gouging). Any substantive increase in production would lower prices and decrease profits, a move that the petroleum sector is unlikely to make.', 'Instead of publicly acknowledging their private assessment of a doomed industry, fossil fuel companies have blamed the spike in prices on the Biden-Harris administration’s climate agenda. This inaccurate argument (repeated by Senate Republicans and affiliated news outlets) (1, 2) is meant to distract from the fact that petroleum companies are at fault for exploiting an unstable energy market.']"
How does the body get diabetes and why does it not go away even after losing weight?,"Diabetes occurs when your body does not process food as energy properly, either because it doesn't respond to insulin or because it doesn't produce enough insulin[2]. Being overweight plays a role in this, as the body needs more insulin than the pancreas can produce in those who develop diabetes[4]. Even if you lose weight, diabetes does not always go away as the pancreas is not always able to keep up with the body's need for insulin[3]. Additionally, when glucose doesn't arrive in your cells, your body compensates by burning fat and muscle at a rapid pace which can lead to unexplained weight loss[5].","[""Losing weight can have a big impact on diabetes. Although it might not cure type 2 diabetes in every case, getting to a healthy body weight does have that potential for many people. Even if it doesn't completely cure the disease, losing weight may make it possible for people with diabetes to take less medication. It often helps manage or prevent some of the health problems that can come with diabetes, too."", 'Diabetes occurs when your body does not process food as energy properly. Insulin is a critical hormone that gets glucose (sugar that is used as energy) to the cells in your body. When you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t respond to insulin or doesn’t produce insulin at all. This causes sugars to build up in your blood, which puts you at risk of dangerous complications.', ""Getting to a lower weight reduces many of these problems. When you weigh less, your pancreas is better able to keep up with your body's need for insulin. In some cases, weight loss is enough to restore blood sugar to a normal level, which eliminates diabetes. Even if it doesn't get your blood sugar completely back to normal, it may lower your need for insulin therapy or other medications to control diabetes. It also lessens your risk for other serious complications of diabetes, including heart problems, kidney disease and nerve damage."", 'The reason why type 2 diabetes develops is not completely clear. But being overweight plays a role. In people who are overweight, the body sometimes needs as much as two to three times more insulin than it would if it was at a healthy weight. In those who develop diabetes, that is more insulin than the pancreas is able to produce.', '“When the glucose doesn’t arrive in your cells, your body thinks it’s starving and finds a way to compensate. It creates energy by burning fat and muscle at a rapid pace. This causes unexplained weight loss,” explains Cotey.']"
Why do the beating of some insects' wings make a buzzing noise while others such as moths do not?,"The buzzing sound of some insects is caused by the beating of their wings. For example, mosquitoes can beat their wings up to 1,000 times per second, and this produces a buzzing noise[1]. Other insects, such as moths, do not produce buzzing noises and instead produce sound by forcible expulsion of air from their respiratory system. Other insects, such as crickets, produce noises by rubbing their wings together[4]. Mosquitoes, on the other hand, buzz because they flap their wings, and they can change the pitch of the buzzing sound as they increase or decrease the frequency of their flapping[5].","['A mosquito’s wings can beat up to 1,000 times per second, and it’s this beating that produces the insect’s characteristic buzzing noise. Amazingly, mosquitoes are able to control the beating of their wings to adjust the frequency of their sound, making their pitch higher or lower.', 'Vibrations of other body parts may be important in insect signalling, most obviously the wings. Sounds are inevitably produced as byproducts of flapping flight, but many insects have developed the use of wing vibrations in communication. The flight sounds in swarming mosquitoes are known often to be species-specific and to function in part, for species recognition, (e.g. Roth, 1948). The use of low frequency wing vibration in the courtship dances of Drosophila species is better known. When in close proximity, the pulsed songs of these flies stimulate antennal receptors of other individuals by air particle vibration in the vicinity (Bennet-Clark, 1971). In this book Hoikkala (Chapter 11) describes the diversity and genetics of these signals in Drosophilidae.', 'Sound production by forcible expulsion of air is said to be rare in insects. Although naturalists have previously known that hawkmoth caterpillars could make sounds — loud squeaks or whistles — only relatively recently have researchers investigated how these sounds are made, by studying the walnut sphinx moth caterpillars. The caterpillars have eight pairs of openings (called spiracles) on their sides; these openings are part of the respiratory system. By systematically blocking each pair of spiracles in turn, experiments showed that the enlarged openings of the eighth pair were responsible for the whistling sounds. The caterpillar forces the air out by contracting the front part of the body.', 'Sure, the sound of crickets chirping is synonymous with an awkward or eerie quiet, but the sound itself is actually pretty loud! A big part of the reason bug noises sound so loud to our ears is because of the frequency they’re at. While the higher frequency of katydid noises produces a buzzing sound, the “low and pure” frequency of cricket noises registers as more of a “musical” chirp to human ears, according to Terminix. The noises crickets make also help attract potential mates, and only males make the noises. Like katydids, crickets rub their wings together to produce these sounds. And the sounds get complicated! “The front wings are modified not only to create sound, but amplify and broadcast it, too,” Insectlopedia reports. “A ‘calling song’ attracts females from a distance. A softer ‘courtship song’ woos her at close range; and a ‘rivalry song’ rebuffs competing males.”', 'Of course, this isn’t actually the reason mosquitoes buzz. Mosquitoes simply buzz because they flap their wings. It’s believed that they can change the pitch of the buzzing sound as they increase or decrease the frequency of their flapping, including when they’re chasing a mate.']"
How do farms wash and sterilize glass milk bottles before reusing them?,"Dairy farms typically wash and sterilize glass milk bottles before reusing them by using high temperature water[1]. Additionally, specialized washers are available to improve hygiene and cleanliness, as well as efficiency[4]. Regular cleaning of the milk bottles is important to maintain good hygiene and a clean environment[5].","['As previously mentioned, the chemicals tend to leach out of the plastic containers into the milk stored in them. This will affect the taste. Choose glass as a BPA free container! But additionally, milk simply keeps longer in glass. And besides that, bacteria is unable to hide in glass containers as easy because they are less porous than plastic. High temperature water is used to wash the glass bottles just prior to filling. Yet the manufacturing facility sterilized the plastic jugs before shipping them t be filled. And glass also stays colder longer due to the heavier material than that of plastic jugs. Voices in America says milk in glass bottles is better for you. It is better for the environment. Glass milk bottles provide better for local farmers and local home milk delivery. And last of all this all enriches a better community.', 'Whether for the breeding of cows, sheep or goats, farmers in several countries wish to offer organic or artisanal production in glass bottles. Often times, they want to reuse their own personalized, returnable containers. The demand for the return of the returnable glass bottle is increasing and Aquatech-BM has a wide range of high-performance devices to accomplish the task of washing and sterilization.', 'Dairy farms are also looking at their own customized, returnable and reusable milk glass bottles. It’s giving the opportunity to create a circular economy in your business.', '“The washer improves hygiene and cleanliness as well as efficiency. If the glass milk bottles are not cleaned and sanitised properly or at all, and milk residue remains, this creates a food safety hazard for Schulz and the dirty bottles must be thrown out due to their contamination risk.”', 'On dairy farms, it is important to regularly clean milk bottles, regardless of size, to keep the environment clean with good hygiene. Dairy farms consume about 800 gallons of milk daily. To be able to store them, the farms use bottles to package this milk.

How much faster would scientific discovery go if all human bodies would be go the state for research after death instead of a grave?,"If all human bodies were available for research after death instead of a grave, scientific discovery could progress much faster. For example, the Australian Facility for Taphonomic Experimental Research (AFTER) is a body farm which studies how the human body deteriorates in unique climatic conditions, and how different circumstances (such as being in the sun/shade, buried/surface, clothed/unclothed etc.) affect the decomposition process[1]. Forensic entomologists can also study insect succession, which is useful in estimating the time since death[2]. Furthermore, the data collected from the AFTER facility can provide invaluable information for police and forensic investigators, as each death scene is unique[4]. However, the findings from the study are limited in some ways, such as using human body parts rather than whole bodies, and testing them in a lab-controlled environment[5].","['Opened in 2016, the Australian Facility for Taphonomic Experimental Research (AFTER) is Australia’s first ‘body farm’. Here, scientists study how the human body deteriorates in our country’s unique climatic conditions, how different circumstances (whether the body is in the sun/shade, buried/surface, clothed/unclothed etc.) affect the decomposition process, and how the smell of decay changes over time. All of the bodies have been specifically donated to the facility for use in medical research.', 'Another method used by forensic entomologists is studying insect succession. As the body decays, it goes through physical, biological and chemical changes. Each stage attracts a different species of insect. So if a body is found more than a month after death, when many of the maggots and flies have already moved on, studying the insects that have moved in to take their place can be helpful in estimating the time since death.', 'Shannon Dawdy: A number of things converged at once. First you have in the mid-19th century, we get a rise of technology and science and a lot of interest in scientific practice and medicine. With the war, people were sent off to die. They were sent off to die, particularly Northern soldiers, to a strange land, the South was really considered a strange land by people in the North, and the families demanded those bodies come back. Before refrigeration, there was no real good way to do that, where they had already been experimenting with embalming for medical dissection, to learn about the body for medical education, but this just went into hyper gear with a couple of innovators around the Civil War, in order to facilitate getting those casualties home.', 'The data collected from the AFTER facility will be able to provide validated scientific methods and results that can be used by police and forensic investigators in their work. Because each death scene is unique—both in terms of the body (including its size, age and trauma suffered) and the circumstances it is placed in (such as the environment, weather, clothing and position)—the science is not infallible. However, by improving our knowledge of the human decomposition process, and how it is affected by and affects the flora and fauna around it, we may be able to help answer questions that can then benefit the living.', 'The findings from the study, while interesting, are limited in some ways. Firstly, the researchers used human body parts, rather than whole bodies. Secondly, the remains were tested in a lab-controlled environment, so they were not exposed to external factors such as light, heat, moisture or insect activity, which may have altered the results.']"
"Why do we sometimes feel more awake with little sleep, but feel more sleepy after a lot of sleep?","Not getting enough sleep can lead to feeling alert and energized due to the brain forming too many connections and needing sleep to filter itself[1]. On the other hand, sleeping too long can make one feel even more tired as they might not need to sleep as long as others[2]. Additionally, sleeping too long can make it difficult to reach the deep sleep stage and can lead to feeling more tired. Finally, even if one gets enough sleep, if it is of poor quality or interrupted by frequent awakenings, one can still feel tired[4].","['When we miss out on sleep, the brain goes into overdrive, leaving us feeling both disconnected from reality and easily startled. We may feel a strange buzz of energy from not sleeping much, but that is because the brain has formed too many connections and requires sleep to filter itself. We are more likely to hallucinate or even have seizures when we are sleep deprived. We also have higher stress levels and a lessened ability to concentrate or problem solve.', 'Sometimes people sleep longer than they need to which can make one feel even more tired. You might not have to sleep as long as others.So you might feel more rested when you sleep less because your getting just the right amount that you need.', ""Despite this, after a poor night's sleep, it isn't unusual to feel energized throughout the day. In fact, our reactions can become quicker and more exaggerated if we have not had enough sleep. A study by Marcello Massimini, a neurophysiologist at Milan University, discovered that the brain increases in sensitivity throughout the day. This is because our brain is constantly forming new connections while we are awake. The longer we are awake, the more active our minds become. Scientists believe that this is partly why sleep deprivation has been shown to reduce symptoms of depression."", 'Getting good sleep, in the right amount, can make a big difference in how you feel. Too little or too much sleep can increase your perception of fatigue. And even if you get enough hours of sleep, you might find yourself dragging the next day if that sleep was interrupted by frequent awakenings or was of poor quality.', ""The more we sleep the more comfort our bodies feel. The longer we sleep the deeper our sleep becomes. From going deeper into dreams to finding complete comfort these are things that occur in longer sleeps. Although sleeping longer can be satisfying it also makes us feel more tired. When we sleep for shorter amounts of time our bodies haven't reached that deep sleep, but have simply received enough time to re-energize our selves. It's just as bad to over sleep as it can be to undersleep. It's important to find the right balance for your personal bodies needs.""]"
Do insects or fish feel pain?,"Research suggests that both insects and fish can feel and react to pain. For example, fish that were injected with a painful substance reacted by stopping eating, rocking back and forth on the tank floor, and rubbing their lips against the tank walls[5].

"Why do humans feel the need to take care of small/vulnerable/""cute"" animals?","Humans feel the need to take care of small/vulnerable/""cute"" animals because of our natural instinct to care for and protect our young[1][2]. Seeing something small and cute stimulates bonding behaviors and the need to take care of it and protect it[2]. It is believed that our reaction to cuteness is not necessarily directly related to some sort of instinctual need to nurture, but rather more of a general, positive feeling that can influence how we socially interact with other people[3]. Vulnerable appearances may actually help them survive[4], and cute aggression may be our brain’s attempt to balance an overwhelmed neurological response so that we can take care of them[5].","['The reason why some people feel so strongly about adorable babies or newborn animals - to the point where they experience cute aggression - is likely linked to our natural instinct to care for and protect our young. As humans, our babies need constant care as they are highly dependent for a while after birth. The intense emotions associated with cute aggression are believed to be linked to our instinctual care mechanisms. When we see something that has baby-like features, we are driven to want to care for it, because we see it as vulnerable.', '""The psychology of cuteness is the idea that we find things cute when they require parental care,"" says Amanda Levison, a licensed professional counselor from Neurofeedback & Counseling Center in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. ""This elicits a response to take care of the babies or baby animals that need to be taken care of. Seeing something small and cute stimulates bonding behaviors and the need to take care of it and protect it.""', ""And while this tidy evolutionary explanation makes sense, our attraction to small objects isn't entirely a result of a primitive desire to act as a parent. In fact, more recent research has indicated that our reaction to cuteness isn't necessarily directly related to some sort of instinctual need to nurture, but rather more of a general, positive feeling that can influence how we socially interact with other people. Here are some of the ways that can play out."", 'So while cute babies and adorable animals may look completely helpless, their vulnerable appearance may actually help them survive.', 'If babies could take care of themselves, it wouldn’t matter so much that adults often experience paralyzing reactions to how adorable they are. Because babies are dependent on us for their well-being, though, it’s important on an evolutionary level that we’re able to snap out of it. That’s where cute aggression seems to come in. The surveys filled out by participants showed that the reaction was also heavily linked to feeling a caretaking urge toward a cute thing. That may indicate cute aggression is our brain’s attempt to balance an overwhelmed neurological response. “A baby can’t survive alone, but if you’re so overwhelmed by how cute it is and how much you love it, then you can’t take care of it, and that baby won’t survive,” she says.']"

Why are certain meats so universally popular as ingredients?,"Meat is popular as an ingredient because it is a good source of protein that meets the requirements of an individual[3].

Why is chicken the most common and usually the only kind of bird people eat?,"Chicken is the most common and usually the only kind of bird people eat because it is the most abundant and important domesticated animal on earth, with more than 23 billion chickens raised in captivity, primarily on factory farms[1].

Although their taste buds aren’t as developed as some animals, chickens still prefer certain foods. Usually, if a chicken isn’t eating a certain food, it’s because it knows there’s something better nearby. In the wild, chickens forage for their food, so must rely on what’s locally and seasonally available. Meanwhile, domestic chickens don’t have to worry about this problem, and instead live off of chicken feed and whatever else they can find in their yard or pen. That being said, we’ve identified a number of foods that chickens frequently feed on and enjoy. Here are 12 foods that chickens like to eat:']"
Do Apple and Microsoft intentionally water down the quality of their software that they make for the other side?,"It is unclear if Apple and Microsoft intentionally water down the quality of their software that they make for the other side. Advocacy groups say companies like Apple are keeping supposedly neutral standards bodies from implementing environmentally friendly measures that could increase device longevity and cut down on the number of new units manufactured[1]. However, trade group the Repair Association has reported that Apple, HP, and other manufacturers use their outsized influence over the groups who regulate the manufacturing of electronic devices to get to decide how their environmental practices are regulated and then get to slap gold certification labels on their products, while ignoring pressing issues like repairability and reusability[2]. Furthermore, electronics makers dominate the discussions of the standards process with more voting power and a larger presence[3]. However, the anecdotal evidence provided by reference  and [1][2][3][4][5] does not necessarily provide conclusive evidence that Apple and Microsoft are intentionally watering down the quality of their software.","['But one of the reasons Apple can sell so many new devices is that we keep tossing aside our old ones, either because the battery life has grown worse or a new, more advanced model just came out. Advocacy groups say this is by design, and that companies like Apple are keeping supposedly neutral standards bodies from implementing environmentally friendly measures that could increase device longevity and cut down on the number of new units manufactured.', 'A new report, out today from trade group the Repair Association, details how the tech industry, through practices like fighting repairability, has undermined and openly combated green technology standards that would cut down on manufacturing waste. Authored by Repair Association board member Mark Schaffer, who runs an environmental consultancy, the report lays out how Apple, HP, and other manufacturers use their outsized influence over the groups who regulate the manufacturing of electronic devices. These companies, which the report says effectively get to decide how their environmental practices are regulated, then get to slap gold certification labels on their products, all while ignoring pressing issues like repairability and reusability.', 'Still, Apple feels that it’s doing enough, and many members of the tech industry feel the same about their own practices. Wiens and his company iFixit have a say in the standards process that would push the industry to go further, with one vote on these boards alongside other NGOs and environmental advocacy groups. However, as Schaffer’s report makes clear, electronics makers like Apple and others dominate these discussions with more voting power and a larger presence. In the case of the most recent IEEE server standard vote, electronics manufacturers represented 41 percent of the group, the largest of any category. Third-party industries represented 28 percent, while academia and public advocacy each represented just 7 percent of the board. (The remaining amount belongs to what are labeled as “general interest” groups.) If any stipulation arises that may hurt the manufacturers’ businesses, they simply vote it down as a unified block, according to the report.', 'I have brought many iphones and ipods and this is a proven fact all Apple is about is Money.

How legal hunting benifits the animals being hunted.,"Legal hunting provides a number of benefits to the animals being hunted. It is regulated by government agencies, so there are strict rules in place to protect endangered or threatened species. It also provides local jobs and revenue, which can work as a deterrent against poaching and helps to conserve ecosystems[2]. Additionally, legal hunting derails conservation efforts by simply devaluing the lives of the hunted animals[4]. Finally, legal hunting involves expensive permits and is limited to specific animal populations and only in certain areas, which is not the case for illegal poaching[3].","['In the United States, for example, trophy hunting is legal in most states. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regulates trophy hunting of certain protected species, such as lions and elephants. Trophy hunters must obtain a permit from the agency before they can hunt wild animals.', 'Because legal hunting provides local jobs and revenue, it can work as a deterrent against poaching and helps to conserve ecosystems, professional hunter Nathan Askew, owner of an American company that leads hunting safaris for ""dangerous game"" in South Africa, Tanzania, Botswana and Mozambique, explained in a Facebook post.', ""And then there's the money involved. Legal hunting, which is conducted under the supervision of government agencies and official guides, involves expensive permits and is limited to specific animal populations and only in certain areas. Illegal poaching, on the other hand, circumvents all regulations and targets animals regardless of their age, sex, or endangered status."", 'But perhaps most importantly, he added, legalized recreational hunting derails conservation efforts by simply devaluing the lives of the hunted animals.', 'There are laws in place to protect endangered or threatened species. These laws vary from country to country but generally prohibit hunting or capturing endangered animals without a permit. In some cases, it is legal to kill wild animals if it is considered a threat to human life or property.']"
Why haven't we found a cost effective way to produce salt water into fresh water?,"There are several reasons why we haven't found a cost effective way to produce salt water into fresh water. One is that desalination requires a tremendous amount of energy to process seawater, and burning more fossil fuels than necessary is a concern[3]. Another issue is that the byproduct of desalination is brine, which is heavier than seawater and can damage the marine ecosystem when discharged into the ocean[2][3]. Finally, only about half of the saltwater piped into a desal plant is made drinkable, meaning the other half is wasted[5].","['The idea is an old one: California is perched beside a huge body of water, so why not take the salt out of the ocean and drink it? Framed that way, desalinization seems like a no-brainer: If the land won’t produce enough freshwater, then the ocean can make up the difference. Of course, it’s not that simple.', 'When desal plants draw in seawater, they kill millions of marine organisms in the course of a year. Then, once the process physically separates the salt from the water, the dense byproduct must be disposed of, and historically, that concentrated brine has been discharged into the ocean. Because the byproduct is heavier than seawater, it doesn’t simply mix back in. It sinks, damaging the marine ecosystem it comes in contact with. One solution is to blend the byproduct back into the seawater using sprayers or special pipes to disperse the water over greater areas more effectively. That is also expensive.', 'This is the controversial idea behind large-scale desalination—great big expensive facilities that turn saltwater into a liquid that won’t kill you. The classic criticism of desal is that it takes a tremendous amount of energy to process seawater, and we really shouldn’t be burning any more fossil fuels than we need to be. But a less chattered-about problem is the effect on the local environment: The primary byproduct of desal is brine, which facilities pump back out to sea. The stuff sinks to the seafloor and wreaks havoc on ecosystems, cratering oxygen levels and spiking salt content.', 'Pumping enormous volumes of water from the ocean through pipes requires large amounts of energy. And pushing that water through the membranes to remove the salt also requires large amounts of energy. Some estimates state that seawater desalination uses up to three times more electricity than various water recycling technologies. Critics argue that importing water from the Colorado River Aqueduct, recycling local wastewater, and instituting local efficiencies are far more energy-efficient options for a thirsty state in the throws of climate change. As states like California work hard to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and their reliance on fossil fuels, using this much power to produce clean water seems to take the state backwards, not forward.', 'Only about half of the saltwater piped into a desal plant is made drinkable. All the salt that’s separated out ends up concentrated into the other half, in a kind of brine that’s much denser than seawater. As a result, it doesn’t easily mix back in.']"
"Biologically, what makes certain animals so difficult to keep alive in captivity (specifically the Giant Panda)?","Keeping certain animals, such as pandas, in captivity can be difficult because they are solitary animals, meaning they are used to living and roaming alone in the wild with thousands of miles of land to thrive in[3]. This means that in captivity, they are confined to one another and this close environment overtakes their natural instinct of being solitary[3]. Furthermore, their habitats are difficult to restore, and reintroduction of pandas into the wild can be costly to carry out[5]. Finally, since there is still much to be learned about pandas, they are important to keep in captivity in order to better understand them and to be able to use advanced techniques in research and conservation initiatives.","['I think it’s necessary to keep pandas in captivity to a point. Inhumane? Yes. Keeping anything in captivity is inhumane. But I think pandas are probably one of the most prioritized animals in captivity. Seeing both wild pandas and captive pandas, the wild pandas are not having as good a living as a panda in captivity. Pandas in captivity are like kings and queens. They have the best food, the best everything. From what I’ve seen, they are often more prioritized than humans. They’re very important to actually keep in captivity because we’re only beginning to understand pandas over the last 20 years. And before that, we weren’t able to breed them in captivity.', 'Why is it necessary to keep pandas in captivity? What do you say to those who argue that it’s inhumane?', 'I feel like the reason they play in captivity is that they are confined to each other in the enclosure. This close environment overtakes their natural instinct of being a solitary animal. In the wild, pandas have thousands and thousands of miles of land that they can thrive in and they rarely see each other. This is one of the reasons why they’re solitary. When they’re young, they’re very vulnerable, and one of their natural instincts to protect themselves is to climb up trees. Therefore, they are not able to socialize on the ground like the captive pandas.', 'We owe it to pandas—and other creatures—to restore their habitats as best we can. But then we should wish them well and leave them alone. If they die out, at least other creatures who are better suited for procreating and sustaining themselves will survive.', ""Some research areas will repeat behavioral observation studies on Tian Tian and Mei Xiang in order to increase sample size and determine whether a behavior pattern is common to giant pandas or particular to an individual. In other areas, such as reproductive biology, the advanced techniques scientists use today largely did not exist when Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing were alive. Also, opportunities for research and conservation initiatives in the wild, including the potential for increasing the wild giant panda population in China through reintroduction, are greater today than at any time in the past. However, these plans and initiatives will be costly to carry out, as will China's official National Plan for the Conservation of Giant Pandas and their Habitats.""]"
the point of view of those in favor of and opposed to dog breeding,"Those in favor of dog breeding argue that it is a straightforward business practice that produces healthy pups and that key stakeholders, such as kennel clubs, breeders, veterinary associations, and animal protection societies, are taking concerns about selective breeding and animal welfare seriously[4]. Those opposed to dog breeding argue that it is a cruel and irresponsible practice that profits from the reproductive systems of dogs and causes health problems in the animals[2].","['Dog breeding is a slave trade that gives no consideration to the health and well-being of the pups, despite merely staying alive until appropriately monetised.', 'Is dog breeding ethical? Dog breeding is a business practice that profits from the reproductive systems of dogs. Our personal preferences for specific breeds cause health problems to the dogs as a result.', 'Dog breeding is straightforward.

Do this repeatedly, and you have yourself a dog breeding business.', 'In terms of supply: there has already been some change in attitude on the part of key stakeholders such as kennel clubs, breeders, veterinary associations and animal protection societies, towards taking concerns about selective breeding and animal welfare seriously. The same is true of public authorities, particularly in Europe, where various boards and committees have been established to propose reforms for dog breeding.2,3', 'Breeding dogs is cruel and irresponsible, especially given the extensiveness of companion animal overpopulation. Dog breeders treat living individuals as commodities to be genetically manipulated for profit.

Why do we as humans need such varied diets when animals in the wild don't.,"Humans need varied diets because we have different nutritional requirements than animals in the wild. Standardized diets may negatively impact animal welfare and the quality of the science produced[2]. Additionally, the modern Western diet is not one of the healthy diets that humans are able to adapt to[2][3][5]. Variants in the specifics of the animal's diet can lead to differing outcomes in experiments[2][4] and human beings need to meet their nutritional requirements through eating a variety of whole, plant-based foods, in sufficient quantity to meet their caloric needs[5].","['Our species has specific nutritional requirements, and we can meet them by eating whole plant foods in sufficient quantity to maintain healthy body weight, just as other animals do, in their natural environments.', 'Another route to improving reproducibility is to focus on animal welfare and encompass more variety in the diet, says Robyn Crook, a behavioural neuroscientist at San Francisco State University in California. “There’s a lot of value that comes from not having a standardized diet,” she says. Consistent data from animals that “are homogeneously extremely stressed and deprived” are not useful to research. “There’s only so much you can standardize about the life of a rat or a mouse before you start to negatively impact welfare. And then you negatively impact science as well,” she says. Gribble agrees. “Some lab diets are not even close to what those animals would be eating in the wild,” she says. “It’s not the nutritional profile that those organisms have adapted to, so that alone could change results.”', 'In other words, there is no one ideal human diet. Aiello and Leonard say the real hallmark of being human isn’t our taste for meat but our ability to adapt to many habitats—and to be able to combine many different foods to create many healthy diets. Unfortunately the modern Western diet does not appear to be one of them.', 'To resolve the disparity, the researchers looked into the experimental set-ups. They found that even though both studies looked at the same level of caloric restriction, the specifics of the animals’ diets could have contributed to the differing outcomes4. “Diet is just another variable,” says Kristin Gribble, a molecular biologist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. “If it’s different between experiments, it’s an additional variable to be considered when explaining the results.”', 'Human beings are one species; we are all the same animal, with the same digestive physiology. And, as is true of all species, we do not require personalized nutritional programs unless we are dealing with a specific disease or some other very unusual condition. Even then, our differences are a matter of degree, not direction. One person might be able to handle more fat in the diet without gaining weight or developing heart disease, particularly if they are highly active. Another person might need to follow Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn’s low-fat, plant-based diet strictly to reverse their advanced-stage heart disease. But eating a high-fat diet, or a high-protein diet, carries no health advantage for any of us, when compared with the well-documented benefits of eating a variety of whole, plant-based foods, in sufficient quantity to meet our caloric needs.']"
How do they do cancer research on animals? Do they have to give the animal cancer? How?,"Animals are used in cancer research to study the origin, progression, and treatment of cancer, as they have shorter lifespans and more rapid generation times compared to humans, so results of studies are obtained quicker[4]. Cancer Research UK funds scientists to develop ways of researching cancer that do not involve animals, or that use fewer animals than current methods, such as experiments on cells grown in the lab, examining samples of human tumours, and using sophisticated computer programmes to understand how cancer behaves[2]. However, in some cases animal research is an essential part of the research process and millions of people are alive today thanks to animal research[5]. Animals do not have to be given cancer for research purposes, as researchers can use existing animal models of cancer to study how the disease progresses and how it can be treated.","['At Cancer Research UK, research involving animals is part of our efforts to beat cancer. This includes discovering the faulty genes and molecules that cause cancer, investigating how the disease grows and spreads, developing and testing new treatment and tests, and exploring how our immune system can help fight tumours.', 'To make sure that the fewest number of animals are used in research, and that the maximum benefit comes from these experiments, we also fund scientists to develop ways of researching cancer that do not involve animals, or that use fewer animals than current methods.

In some areas there’s simply no other way to get the information needed to make progress against the disease.', 'Cancer is a very complex disease and research geared towards learning more about its origin, progression, and treatment is intense and ever evolving. Medical researchers use animals to study cancer for a variety of reasons.

What would happen if bees died?,"If all bees died, it would be a disaster for our planet as many plants would start to just disappear one by one, and all animal species would start to struggle to find food[1]. Humans would become responsible for taking up the slack, but could only do so for a few of the plants that require pollination due to a lack of people[2]. Bees have been dying off at record rates for the past decade[3], and if they were to go extinct, there would be a number of consequences. For example, plants would set fewer seeds and would have lower reproductive success, which would alter ecosystems[5]. Additionally, many animals, such as bee-eater birds, would lose their prey and this would also impact natural systems and food webs[5].","['If all bees died it may not be a total extinction event for humans, but it would be a disaster for our planet.

"When growing yearly crops, what happens to the vast majority of the plant that is inedible? Is it currently used or is it disposed?","The vast majority of the plant that is inedible is usually disposed. This occurs in monocropping, where bioengineered, pesticide-resistant crops are used and when pest and disease cause crop failure. However, some farmers are shifting their land-use patterns and crop choice to sustain production growth and keep pace with current trajectories of demand[3]. Cultural controls, such as rotating vegetables to a different spot each year and removing and destroying old plants at the end of the growing season are also used[4]. Additionally, agroforestry systems with perennial crops, such as coffee and cacao, may be more important carbon sinks than those that combine trees with annual crops[5].","['The fundamental issue with monocropping is the “all the eggs in one basket” problem. Crop failure is an inevitable part of farming. For myriad reasons that farmers can’t control (most of them falling under the categories of weather, pests, and disease), not all plants thrive and produce a bountiful and profitable harvest every single year.', 'As we’ve seen, monocropping and pesticide use go hand in hand. But insects and weeds are rapidly developing resistance to the most widely used pesticides, which creates a vicious cycle — when bioengineered, pesticide-resistant crops fail, agribusiness has doubled down on the strategy by unleashing an “arms war” of increased and more diverse pesticide deployment.', 'Crop suitability. Another method of assessing the effects of climate change on crop yields that combined observations of current maximum-attainable yield with climate analogues also found strong reductions in attainable yields across a large fraction of current cropland by 2050 (Pugh et al. 2016254). However, the study found the projected total land area in 2050, including regions not currently used for crops, climatically suitable for a high attainable yield similar to today. This indicates that large shifts in land-use patterns and crop choice will likely be necessary to sustain production growth and keep pace with current trajectories of demand.', '- In the garden, rotating vegetables to a different spot each year is a popular cultural control used to disrupt year-to-year pest cycles, as is removing and destroying old plants at the end of the growing season.', 'Agroforestry systems with perennial crops, such as coffee and cacao, may be more important carbon sinks than those that combine trees with annual crops.

"How can food products that require refrigeration after opening (salad dressings, tomato products, etc) maintain their freshness on store shelves for days at a time?","Food products that require refrigeration after opening can maintain their freshness on store shelves for days at a time by using refrigeration to keep them fresh for longer. Keeping tomatoes and tomato sauce in the refrigerator after opening is not dangerous, but it is better to store them in a glass or plastic storage container to retain their flavor[4]. Additionally, tomatoes should be stored at room temperature as they originally came from a warm climate and refrigeration can harm their flavor, color, and texture[5]. Finally, many staples and canned foods have a relatively long shelf life when stored at room temperature[3].","['*Refrigeration ensures that commercial sauces and condiments stay fresh for a longer period of time. Shelf-stable commercial sauces are safe when stored at room temperature after opening. Quality, not safety, is the reason the labels on these products suggest that they be refrigerated after opening.', 'Serious Eats did extensive fresh tomato storage research and taste testing and found essentially the same thing: “Because peak-season market tomatoes are already perfectly ripe, they benefit very little from extra time in the heat, and in many cases they are harmed by it, while the refrigerator does minimal harm once tomatoes are ripe.” They kept tomatoes in the fridge for up to four days no problem.', 'Room temperature such as in a pantry or in a cupboard: Many staples and canned foods have a relatively long shelf life.

"Why do small animals and birds seem compelled to dart right in front of moving vehicles at the last possible moment, barely avoiding impact (if at all)?","Small animals and birds often dart in front of moving vehicles at the last possible moment because they are searching for food, water, cover, and mates, and they have to cross roads and highways to do so. Additionally, they may perceive a car as a predator and try to run directly at it to escape to the presumed safety on the other side[2]. Another possible explanation is that some birds cannot rise fast enough to evade an oncoming car without using the air current the car pushes to provide extra lift, so if the driver brakes too abruptly, the bird may crash into the windshield[4]. Finally, it can be difficult to see animals when facing bright headlights, so lowering the high beams can help avoid a collision[5].","['Animals are forced to cross roads and highways in search of food, water, cover and mates—placing them in the path of our speeding vehicles.', 'Rabbits, and probably squirrels and chipmunks too, will also often wait at a roadside until a car has come too close to stop, then run directly at the car to try to escape underneath it to the presumed safety on the other side. This apparently suicidal behavior actually saves many a rabbit’s life when a hawk, owl, or eagle swoops: once the raptor is committed to a strike path, and is descending too rapidly to change it, the rabbit runs straight toward the swoop so that the bird cannot strike without slowing down, pulling up, and reversing direction, all of which gives the rabbit getaway time.', 'When we moved to Oregon, my dad taught me the best trick: Always aim for the tail end. If you have to make a split second decision which way to swerve to avoid an animal that has jumped in the road in front of you, swerve towards its tail end. They will be moving forward anyway, and you will probably avoid the collision.', 'Many birds cannot rise fast enough to evade an oncoming car without using the air current the car pushes to provide extra lift.

"Since our brain can quickly remember music that we heard before and we can actually ""play"" it in our head, why do we feel the urge to listen to the actual thing?","Listening to music triggers the release of dopamine in the brain, which increases our enjoyment and comfort[1][3]. It is also quite common to experience earworms, which are songs that pop into our minds without us actively trying to recall them[2]. Additionally, research has shown that when we listen to music we like or are familiar with, different parts of the brain activate and memories associated with it are emotional memories that never fade out[3]. Furthermore, a study conducted by Dartmouth University found that when a familiar song is played to research subjects, the participants' auditory cortex automatically fills in the rest, causing their brains to ""sing"" long after the song has ended[4]. Lastly, when we imagine hearing a song, the same auditory cortex that is active when we're actually listening to a song is reactivated[2][4][5], causing us to feel the urge to listen to the actual thing.[2]","['Apps like Heardle are satisfying to play because “when we perceive or imagine music that’s quite meaningful to us, we get activation in what we call the reward centers of our brain,” Jakubowski says. Listening to music releases dopamine in the brain, with our dopamine levels increasing by up to 9% when listening to music we enjoy. That’s one reason why music has become so intertwined with how we express and comfort ourselves.', 'Manyof us can hear music in our minds, which is called having musical or auditory imagery. “This can happen voluntarily or deliberately, so if I [ask you to] think of the song ‘Happy Birthday,’ you can probably hear it playing in your mind right now, but it can also happen involuntarily. That’s what we call an earworm, when we get a song that pops into mind without you actually trying to recall any music,” Jakubowski says. It’s quite common to have a song stuck in your head—“around 90% of people say they have an earworm at least once a week and around ⅓ of people say they have an earworm at least once a day,” she notes. As you might imagine, people who listen to or engage with music more frequently tend to experience more earworms. The more we listen to music, the more it spontaneously comes to mind.', 'Turns out, whether it’s rock ‘n’ roll, jazz, hip-hop or classical, your gray matter prefers the same music you do. “It depends on your personal background,” Yonetani says. For a while, researchers believed that classical music increased brain activity and made its listeners smarter, a phenomenon called the Mozart effect. Not necessarily true, say Sugaya and Yonetani. In recent studies, they’ve found that people with dementia respond better to the music they grew up listening to. “If you play someone’s favorite music, different parts of the brain light up,” Sugaya explains. “That means memories associated with music are emotional memories, which never fade out — even in Alzheimer’s patients.”', 'When we listen to a song, it triggers a part of the brain called the auditory cortex.

How is it that some animals can be domesticated over generations but once released into the wild can undergo physical changes and quickly become feral?,"It is possible for some animals to be domesticated over generations but quickly become feral when released into the wild due to the varying and complex histories of feral populations and the novel selection pressures they experience. When an animal is domesticated, their behavior is conditioned to be tolerant of humans, but they remain genetically wild[2]. When a domestic cat is released into the wild and has kittens, it only takes one generation for her offspring to become feral[3]. Legacies of domestication are seen in many feral plants and animals, and these features can have important and unexpected roles in subsequent adaptation to changing environments[4]. It is also possible for certain species of domesticated animals like chickens and pigs to escape to live and breed in the wild and quickly start to look and act like their wild ancestors again[5].","['Formerly domesticated organisms and artificially selected genes often escape controlled cultivation, but their subsequent evolution is not well studied. In this review, we examine plant and animal feralization through an evolutionary lens, including how natural selection, artificial selection, and gene flow shape feral genomes, traits, and fitness. Available evidence shows that feralization is not a mere reversal of domestication. Instead, it is shaped by the varied and complex histories of feral populations, and by novel selection pressures. To stimulate further insight we outline several future directions. These include testing how ‘domestication genes’ act in wild settings, studying the brains and behaviors of feral animals, and comparative analyses of feral populations and taxa. This work offers feasible and exciting research opportunities with both theoretical and practical applications.', 'Domestication is not the same as taming. A domestic animal is genetically determined to be tolerant of humans. An individual wild animal, or wild animal born in captivity, may be tamed—their behavior can be conditioned so they grow accustomed to living alongside humans—but they are not truly domesticated and remain genetically wild.', 'Feral cats were either previously domesticated and have been without human contact for long enough to revert to their natural wild state, or they are cats with the potential to be domesticated. If a domestic cat released into the wild has kittens, it often only takes one generation for her offspring to become feral. Feral cats shouldn’t be confused with strays, however. Stray cats have a history of close human contact and can often be easily re-domesticated.', 'Legacies of domestication are seen in many feral plants and animals. These features can have important and unexpected roles in subsequent adaptation to changing (e.g., feral) environments.', 'Apr 09, 2020 — What happens when certain species of domesticated animals like chickens and pigs escape to live and breed in the wild?

"Why is it easy to look at dead animals and guts/gore, but it's hard/scary to see the same with humans?","It is easier to look at dead animals and guts/gore than it is to see the same with humans because humans have a concept of death that animals do not have. Thanatosis, or feigning death, is a complex behaviour that requires cognitive processing, and suggests that predators possess a concept of death[3]. This is because the complexity of thanatosis is more than just a mere paralysis, and involves the animal actively imitating the characteristics of a corpse[2][3]. Exploiting predators' necrophobia in this way would require displaying concrete sensory stimuli, which is not necessary in the case of humans, suggesting that humans have a concept of death that animals don't[5].","['It’s true that many, if not most, animals come with a hard-wired tendency towards necrophobia, which is a stereotypical aversion to corpses that is not mediated by a concept of death. This means that most animals are disgusted by the smell or the appearance of corpses, even if they do not understand what a corpse is. This unlearned aversion serves an important protective function for the organism, since dead bodies are a paradise for pathogens. Could it be the case, then, that thanatosis works by activating the predators’ necrophobia? This would again mean that it would not give us any evidence of the predators’ possession of a concept of death, since it would simply exploit predators’ non-conceptual and innate aversion to corpses.', 'The complexity of thanatosis, and its clear resemblance to the characteristics of corpses, therefore makes it unlikely that no cognitive processing of the prey’s corpse-like appearance on behalf of the predator plays a role. If thanatosis evolved to exploit predators’ necrophobia, it is probably a necrophobia that is mediated or supported by a concept of death. The opossum’s trick would work not just because she looks disgusting, but because she looks disgusting because she appears dead (and the predator has learned that dead prey taste bad or upset the stomach). In such a case, the predator’s concept of death would be involved in the success of the mechanism.', 'The main reason why thanatosis is such a good piece of evidence of predators’ concept of death has to do with the particular complexity exhibited by this behaviour. In order to see this, we need to begin by distinguishing thanatosis from a similar – and probably evolutionarily related – behaviour. Many animals, when they feel threatened, go into a kind of paralysis that reduces the probability of being preyed upon. This is known as tonic immobility and can be found in a wide range of species, from insects to humans. While tonic immobility is a simple behaviour that operates at a superficial level – in some species it can even be accompanied by an increase in heart rate – in thanatosis, the animal not only stays still but actively imitates the characteristics of a corpse. Although thanatosis might have evolved from tonic immobility, it’s much more than a mere paralysis: the animal is feigning death.', 'My point is not to settle the question of the concrete reasons why natural selection has favoured the evolution of thanatosis as a defence mechanism. What I want to argue is that, if thanatosis has evolved, it’s because there are some advantages – regardless of the concrete form they take – to appearing specifically as though one were dead. What is there in common to lying belly-up completely still, not responding to interactions, with eyes and mouth wide open, while secreting blood and defecating? What is there in common to having a blue tongue, smelling rotten, being cold and not exhibiting signs of breathing? The only possible explanation to why these characteristics occur together as part of the same behaviour is that the animals are feigning death.', 'This, too, is not convincing as an explanation of the full complexity of this behaviour. Necrophobia is usually linked to concrete sensory stimuli, such as cadaverine or putrescine (two chemical components given off by rotting corpses). An animal usually needs only to perceive these stimuli for necrophobia to kick in. In humans, the smell of putrescine alone is enough to trigger our fight-or-flight mechanisms. So, prey looking to exploit predators’ necrophobia need only display some of these concrete sensory stimuli, which would again make the majority of the characteristics that make up thanatosis displays irrelevant, especially those that have to do with a reduction of vital functions.']"
why would any animal evolve to eat meat when they could just eat plant matter which is both more abundant and easier to hunt for?,"Animals evolved to eat meat because it was an abundant and easily accessible resource. Meat eaters evolved in areas where meat was plentiful while herbivores evolved in areas where vegetation was plentiful[2]. Omnivores are the most adaptive of all the species and thrive in a larger range of environments[2]. Early humans were already omnivorous and opportunistic, so when meat became plentiful, they took advantage of it[3]. It is hypothesized that increased consumption of animal-sourced food during human evolution selected for “meat-adaptive genes”, which enabled the shift from herbivorous to omnivorous diets[4]. Furthermore, humans are well adapted to meat eating, as they have developed genetic, physiological, morphological, and nutritional adaptations to eating animal tissue[5].","['Why did some animals evolve to eat meat or vegetation while others eat both? It comes down to availability of resources. “In terms of evolving to be a meat eater or plant eater, basically, any place there is available energy you will have a ‘niche’ for a species to fill in the ecosystem,” said McCarthy.', 'Meat eaters evolved in areas where meat was plentiful while herbivores evolved in areas where vegetation was plentiful. Omnivores are the most adaptive of all the species and thrive in a larger range of environments.', 'Even dedicated herbivores such as deer or cows will sometimes try meat if they chance upon it. There are records of cows devouring live chicks and munching dead rabbits, of deer eating birds, and of the duiker, a tiny African antelope, hunting frogs. (If you want to see a few of these carnivorous herbivores caught on camera, check out YouTube.) So it comes hardly as a surprise that our ancestors, who might have already been supplementing their diets with the meat of an occasional small monkey, saw the new abundance of savanna grazers as a way to get a few additional calories. The hominins were already omnivorous and opportunistic. If something was edible and it was there, they ate it. By 2.6 million years ago, there was a lot of meat around. Just as Purgatorius took advantage of the climate change and a new wealth of fruits, their descendants, early Homo, successfully adapted their diets to the changes in their environment. But this time, it meant going after meat.', 'Some scientists hypothesize that the increased consumption of animal-sourced food during human evolution selected for “meat-adaptive genes”, in order to increase resistance to harmful effects of fat, toxins, and pathogens, and to delay dysfunctions in the brain and heart, that are associated with consuming increasing. These genes may also enable a major increase in lifespan, which could partly explain the difference in life expectancy between humans and other great apes. Meat-adaptive genes enabled the shift from herbivorous to omnivorous diets. However, this is currently just a hypothesis, and requires further research to be verified.', 'In light of all evidence presented, it would be difficult to say that humans have no adaptations to meat eating. In fact, the available evidence suggests that humans are quite well adapted to meat eating. As humans evolved and consumed greater amounts of meat, they developed genetic, physiological, morphological, and nutritional adaptations to eating animal tissue. Evidence cited by some arguing that humans are natural herbivores is lacking in comparison, although theoretically it is plausible. It must be noted, however, that some members of animal rights organizations and vegan and vegetarian groups may be controversially advocating for this in order to push their agendas to the general public. Further evidence should be collected before propagating a certain worldview or lifestyle in order to avoid moral quandaries.']"

"If unhealthy and fast food can make us so unhealthy it can kill, why does our brain allow it?","The reason why our brain allows us to eat unhealthy and fast food is because, in some ways, it can be addictive. Fast food, processed food, commercial baked goods, and sweets can stimulate the brain in an addictive fashion, which can lead to more serious illnesses. In addition, a high-fat diet can lead to oxidative stress in the brain and activate microglia, which can cause inflammation in the brain’s weight-control center and make a person eat even more[2].

"The ""Jurassic Park"" method of controlling gender","The ""Jurassic Park"" method of controlling gender involves manipulating all of the animals genetically by making them female and denying them the extra hormone that would enable the fetus to become male, in order to prevent unauthorized breeding and maintain a sustainable and stable population[1].

During the Isla Nublar incident however, Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. John Hammond‘s grandchildren discovered physical evidence of breeding dinosaurs in the park when they stumbled upon an abandoned Velociraptor nest. Grant realized that the animals were capable of breeding because the gender controlled introduced by Jurassic Park geneticists was neutralized by the frog DNA they implemented to fill the holes in the DNA structure.

Reproduction is forced upon female animals in a lab, by men, to make money – and they break free, resist, and make babies in their own way.

"Why do good singers have a ""wobbly"" effect in their voices when they sing a pitch for an extended period of time? Is it something they do on purpose, or is it a side effect of pushing their vocals to the extreme?","It is a side effect of pushing their vocals to the extreme. Singers may become nervous and begin hitting sour notes due to lack of confidence or self-consciousness[3]. They may also unconsciously attempt to sing a few notes below the correct pitch due to being in a comfort zone, or because they don't trust their voice or hearing[3][4]. Their pitch may also be off by a semitone or more due to difficulty matching a simultaneously presented pitch[5].","['Often times singers will not commit to high notes out of fear that their voice will not sound good or for fear of voice breaks. You can sense when your voice is getting wobbly and that can cause immediate self-consciousness, so instead of committing to the song the singer gets even quieter to help avoid the potential embarrassment of a voice crack, which funny enough can cause the said voice crack.', 'A wide-swinging vibrato or a vocal wobble may lead to pitchiness or to the perception of pitchiness, as it makes it difficult, if not impossible, to identify the pitch centre when the fluctuations of the note are too slow and cover too broad an interval. A singer who tends to manufacture vibrancy through muscular effort (e.g., a quivering jaw, a wagging tongue or a shaking diaphragm) or other incorrect methods will not be able to achieve an acceptable oscillatory rate - it is impossible to make these larger muscle groups shake or vibrate as fast as a naturally occuring vibrato would. As a result, every movement of pitch away from the actual written note will be noticeable.', ""There are often psychological reasons for these tensions, including self-consciousness or a lack of confidence regarding the voice. If people are self-conscious about singing in front of, or even along with, others, they may become nervous and begin hitting sour notes. These pitch errors simply reinforce their belief that they can't sing well. When they have experienced enough discouragement because of their voices, they lose confidence in both their voice and their hearing. (They no longer trust their voice or hearing.) Hearing then becomes disconnected with their voices, and such singers cease to correct the way that they sing by means of their hearing. From this point on, confidence can rapidly decrease."", ""Another common explanation for pitch errors relates to another type of psychological 'hang up'. Many untrained singers have a 'comfort zone' in which they prefer to sing, usually in the middle and lower parts of their ranges. If the pitch of the song or vocal exercise starts or rises at any point above this comfortable and familiar range of notes, the singers get nervous, self-conscious and doubt their ability to hit the higher notes. They then attempt, either consciously or subconsciously, to begin singing a few notes below the correct pitch. (I used to teach a student who would unintentionally sing harmonies all the time. She wasn't usually off key; she simply wasn't singing the same notes that I was playing on the keyboard, even when I played only the single notes of the melody line, rather than a chord.) Although they know that their pitch is off, they can't seem to muster up the nerve to try to sing any higher than they are psychologically comfortable with."", ""Pfordresher and Brown's research has also shown that most 'pitch poor' singers are more than just a little off when asked to repeat notes, whether they are a few notes in sequence or just a single note.

How are the same species of fish found in multiple non-connected lakes?,"Fish can be found in multiple non-connected lakes through several methods.

Another is through their life cycles, where they can move through and between river systems downstream or upstream to lakes, colonizing many different lakes in a large basin[4]. Finally, during some glacial periods, lakes can become a refuge for fish species, allowing them to survive and be isolated from other regional water bodies[5].","['At least 34 non-native fish species are present in the Great Lakes.

Fish have recolonized all of the present-day rivers and lakes that were under ice during that period. Although we often tend to think of fish in lakes as lake dwellers, many of these species use rivers during parts of their life cycles. For example, Yellowstone cutthroat trout occupy a number of lakes throughout their range, but use rivers for spawning. Some of the young fish then move back to the lake to mature, whereas others remain in the rivers. One can imagine that over time, fish moving through and between river systems downstream or upstream to lakes, could colonize many different lakes throughout a large basin.', ""Now if you can envision this, you can easily see how fish can be distributed so widely in North America.

"If we attach certain personalty traits/ skills and abilities to particular breeds of dogs, then why are we wrong to attach them to particular groups of people?","Attaching certain personality traits/skills and abilities to particular breeds of dogs is different than attaching them to particular groups of people because dogs have been specifically bred to possess certain characteristics that people find desirable and useful, such as service, herding, and rescue skills. Additionally, the human-dog relationship is deeply entrenched, with dogs being equipped with the skills to understand human emotions, gestures, and actions and form cooperative teams with us[3]. Furthermore, dogs have been enculturated in our society and have adapted to the human environment through their general canine abilities of intraspecies communication, plus a combination of phylogenetic and ontogenetic abilities of interspecies communication[5]. These factors make it acceptable to attribute certain traits/skills and abilities to particular breeds of dogs, whereas it is wrong to do so for particular groups of people.","['Different explanations have been proposed regarding the apparent paradox, that people buy breeds of dog that are predisposed to diseases and other welfare problems, while at the same time caring deeply about their dogs. One line of thought is that prospective dog owners, prior to acquisition, are not fully aware of the potential problems their dog may face. It is also possible that dog owners simply do not perceive the clinical signs of some inherited disorders as problems, but rather as normal, breed-specific characteristics . Alternatively, it could be that, when choosing a suitable breed, other characteristics of the dog may be considered more important than its health and welfare . Dogs with extreme physical features may possess qualities that matter to their owners to such an extent that they outshine any health and other welfare problems faced by the dogs.', 'Differences in levels of attachment across owners of different breeds may also, at least partly, be explained by differences in the people who choose to acquire particular dogs. As we saw, there are clear differences in motivations among people who are attracted to different breeds. To fully study this, it would be necessary to link our findings with various socio-demographic characteristics in more detail or even to do some kind of psychological profiling of potential owners of the different breeds. This is an important subject for further study but is beyond the scope of the current paper. In the context of the current paper it is important to underline that the results presented stand up, even when controlling for socio-demographic variables that are potential confounders.', 'Dogs are deeply entrenched in interactions with humans, for which they are equipped with outstanding skills to understand human emotions, gestures, and actions. They form cooperative teams with us (e.g., as assistance, rescue, or herding dogs), they engage with us as communicative partners, and they have been enculturated in our society and are clearly part of our social game. Bonds between humans and dogs can be very intense and even resemble parent–infant attachment bonds. It seems to be this specific relationship of shared understanding and close affiliation that is at the heart of the view that dogs are indeed humans’ best friend.', 'People may also use particular dog breeds to express aspects of their own personality and preferences [17–18]. Studies have found resemblance in facial features between owners and their dogs , and resemblance in overall physical features between owner and dog, e.g. size, hair, attractiveness, perceived friendliness [20–21]. Infantile facial features and other human-like attributes in dogs have also been found to attract people [22–23]. Finally, a dog’s physical appearance may influence social acknowledgment from other people .', 'In this section, we will investigate the characteristics of the human–dog relationship by following the decisive question of how dogs adapt to the human environment. We will turn our attention to the latest research results from the fields of animal cognition and behavior. The default assumption is that dogs’ skills are firmly based on some general canine abilities of intraspecies communication plus a combination of phylogenetic and ontogenetic abilities of interspecies communication. The latter ones have emerged from domestication and individual social and cognitive development (Huber, 2016). Both kinds of developmental factors have contributed to the success of dogs living among and with humans, including their adoption of the numerous roles humans give to them.']"
Why don't cigarette companies just put tobacco in their product? Why is all that other crap in there?,"Tobacco companies add other ingredients to their products for a variety of reasons. One of the main reasons is to make the product more appealing to consumers by adding flavors, such as coffee, honey, alcohol, spearmint, fruit, and candy that are now banned in many places. They also add other ingredients to reduce the harshness of the tobacco, making it easier for young people to use[4][5]. Additionally, tobacco companies use marketing tactics to manipulate customers into making decisions that are not always in their best interests[3]. Finally, tobacco companies often use their products and packaging to send anti-litter messages, encouraging customers to dispose of their products properly[4].","['Big Food and Big Tobacco share some common bloodlines. It wasn’t very long ago that some of these companies were one and the same. RJR Nabisco, for instance, once simultaneously contained the companies that made Camel cigarettes and Chips Ahoy! cookies. Until the mid-2000s, the companies that manufacture Marlboro and Virginia Slims cigarettes were part of the same conglomerate, Philip Morris (now Altria), which manufactured Kraft Macaroni & Cheese and Kool Aid. Those companies have since split their tobacco businesses from their food businesses, but heavy-handed product marketing may be ingrained in the companies’ DNA.', 'Under California’s new flavored tobacco law, most tobacco products sold in the state at retail locations and vending machines can no longer have a “characterizing flavor” (premium cigars and hookah are exempt). That means the tobacco in a cigarette can’t taste or smell like coffee, honey, alcohol, spearmint, fruit, candy or any other “distinguishable flavor or smell.” The FDA is also considering a similar proposal to ban menthol as a “characterizing flavor” federally.', 'Besides denying the connections between their products and disease, food and tobacco companies both use the same language to blame their customers for the harm caused by their products. “What people want to do is their own decision,” said American Tobacco CEO Robert Heimann in 1988. More recently, Don Thompson, then CEO of McDonald’s, said “All of us have to make personal choices.” Those statements may be literally true, but ignore the extent to which companies persuade, lure, and manipulate customers—including children—into making the very decisions that companies say should be up to them.', '""Individual people are responsible for smoking-related litter. But just as beverage and fast-food companies have taken steps to provide anti-litter education to their customers, so could the tobacco manufacturers increase their commitment to educating the buyers of their products. Industry involvement is absolutely essential in educating smokers and solving this litter problem. It would cost nothing for cigarette packages to have an anti-litter message like ""Cigarette butts are litter too—Please dispose properly."" Manufacturers could also use their web sites and ads to urge smokers not to litter. Some tobacco companies, such as Philip Morris, USA, have started to address smoking-related litter on their website and through direct-mail pieces to their customers. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation also has a web page that discusses cigarette litter. CVW encourages other companies to educate their customers too.', 'One of the primary ways that the tobacco and vape industries have attracted new youth users is by selling sweet, fruity and candy-flavored products. Flavors improve the taste and reduce the harshness of tobacco products, making them more appealing and easier for young people to use. Flavors also create the impression that these products are less harmful than they really are.']"
"What are those hard, unchewable pieces you sometimes find in meat?","The hard, unchewable pieces you sometimes find in meat are usually sinews, gristle, unchewable tissues, large chunks and streaks of fat, or collagen[1].

Worse yet, you might find large chunks and streaks of fat. On the other hand, good jerky should be absolutely lean, practically pure meat. It\'s OK to have tiny flecks and streaks of fat, as this will add some ""beefy"" flavor. But too much fat will cause the meat to taste rancid.', '- Without going into too much science, the general rule of cooking is that meat get hard as it loses its moisture and arguably its fat. The art of Chinese cooking is to try keeping the moisture in the meat and the cornflour in the recipe was to seal moisture in the meat.', 'Whether it comes from a cow, pig, or chicken, meat and poultry consists primarily of muscle fibers, water, connective tissue, and fat. Muscle tissue resembles many bundles of wire, each surrounded by a covering of connective tissue. Each bundle is made up of numerous muscle fibers. These fibers are made up of many smaller structures called myofibrils. Cooking changes the structure of those muscle fibers, and whether a piece of meat comes out tough or tender depends on cooking time and cooking temperature. When red meat and poultry are heated, the long protein molecules begin to contract, first (between 104°F/40°C and 145°F/63°C) in diameter, and then (above 145°F/63°C) in length. A single muscle fiber can shrink to half its original length during the cooking process.', 'Does it require heavy machinery to chew?"" - In the old days, it might have been acceptable to have tough jerky. But these days, most gourmet brands can make simple, all natural, beef jerky in a tender, moist chew, that still retains the chewing texture of a grilled steak. If your jaws getting too tired, then look for something easier to chew.', 'Collagen is another common protein found in meat. It is responsible for sheathing the elongated muscle fibers that make up a cut of meat. You see, meat is made of these long muscle fibers, and each individual one is encased in coat of collagen. Furthermore, these elongated muscle fibers are bunched together to form larger muscle masses, which are also encased in collagen. These “bundles” of meat fibers are known in the culinary industry as the “grain” of the meat. Interestingly, cartilage also contains collagen, but it is not a type of connective tissue.']"
How does declawing a cat work and is there any consequences of having the surgery?,"Declawing a cat involves a surgical procedure called an onyectomy, which involves amputating the front knuckles of the cat's toes[4].

So can plants feel pain,"The answer to this question is not definitive as scientists are still debating the issue. Plants don't have a nervous system or a brain so they cannot feel pain in the same way that animals do[2]. The current scientific consensus is that plants do not feel pain[2][3], although some studies have suggested that plants may be able to sense environmental stress and emit a high-frequency distress sound in response[4].","['- For plants to feel pain, they need a nervous system and a brain. And one person cited vegetablecruelty.com as a source that plants feel pain. I went on that site and it is obviously a joke.', 'While scientists are not in complete agreement on whether plants feel pain, the simple answer to the question is no. As explained by plant biologist Dr. Elizabeth Van Volkenburgh, all living organisms perceive and respond to painful touch, but plants do not perceive or “feel” pain the same way that animals do because they lack a nervous system and brain.', 'The simple answer is that, currently, no one is sure whether plants can feel pain. We do know that they can feel sensations. Studies show that plants can feel a touch as light as a caterpillar’s footsteps. But pain, specifically, is a defense mechanism. If something hurts humans, we react instinctually to it—“fight or flight”—as do other animals. But plants don’t have that ability—nor do they have nervous systems or brains—so they may have no biological need to feel pain.

"Why is it possible to clone a mammoth with an elephant bearing it, but not possible for a monkey to bear a human (or donkey bearing horse and so on)?","It is possible to clone a mammoth with an elephant bearing it because mammoths are a variety within the elephant kind, and thus exhibit no evidence of particles-to-people evolution[3]. Mammoths and elephants belong to the same kind and therefore have the same number of chromosomes, which makes it possible for the elephant to bear the mammoth[1]. On the other hand, cloning a human with a monkey is not possible because humans and monkeys do not belong to the same created kind and therefore have different numbers of chromosomes.","['If Kazufumi Goto and Akira Iritani come back to Japan with sperm and viable DNA from some other cell of a mammoth, they’ll face a choice: they can try to create either a hybrid or a clone. If they use sperm to create a hybrid, they’ll first need to be sure that the chromosomes are intact. The only way they’ll know is by injecting some of them into mouse eggs. If they move around in the proper pattern, the researchers will shift to elephants. By using only X chromosome–bearing sperm, they’ll ensure that the hybrid will be female. That way they’ll be able to impregnate the female with more mammoth sperm, producing a second hybrid that’s mostly mammoth. But it’s impossible to predict whether a mammoth-elephant hybrid would be fertile. Donkeys and horses produce sterile mules, while swamp buffalo and river buffalo can breed successfully—even though the two buffalo species have a different number of chromosomes.', 'Japanese scientists are hoping to clone a mammoth and effectively bring an extinct animal variety back to life. Such a feat would involve recovering high-quality DNA from the frozen tissue of a mammoth carcass and then inserting it into an egg and placing it in the womb of a living elephant.

Animals still exist within the reproductive boundaries of their original created kinds. Such a feat would also show that ""ancient"" events are not so ancient, since relatively recent DNA would be needed for success.', 'Cloning a mammoth would be more spectacular than breeding one, but it entails an extra set of hurdles. If the researchers find cells with decent enough DNA, Iritani says, he would inject a mammoth cell’s nucleus into an elephant egg and zap it with electricity to jolt the egg into fertilization mode. But this method demands a cell with a nucleus in good working order, and experts doubt that one could be found in mammoth remains. “I cannot imagine finding a cell in that condition,” says Ian Wilmut, who cloned Dolly. However, he adds, “who is to say what techniques will become available in the future?”', 'Second, cloning a mammoth will require a fully functional adult animal from the same created kind.

"How does the brain do math? Mental arithmetic, for example.","The brain does math by activating several brain areas that work together to solve arithmetic problems[1][2][5].

Mental arithmetic is like going to the gym for the brain, improving cognitive abilities and helping to focus more and avoid distractions[4]. When solving an arithmetic problem, many brain areas work together initially, with older individuals relying more on specialized brain areas[2][5].","['We can learn how mental arithmetic improves concentration and memory by understanding how the brain works to solve arithmetic problems. From the perspective of the left and right brain, mental arithmetic exercises stimulate both sides of our brains at the same time. It helps to increase the connection between the two brain hemispheres, especially in young students whose brains are still developing. When we solve math problems, the calculation part is done on the left side of the brain, while the right side of the brain visualizes the problem being solved. Both sides of the brain are trained to work simultaneously.', 'All of the brain areas work together by communicating with one another. This communication happens over a wide network of pathways (called white matter) that connect all brain areas. These networks are similar to the way roads connect different cities, allowing different brain regions are involved in the process of solving arithmetic problems. They are all related to our attention in varying degrees. When doing mental math, the brains need to mobilize visual attention, sequential reasoning, decision-making etc, which requires to concentrate and avoid distractions. It also trains kids to rely more on their own minds.', ""The brain-imaging evidence collected by Dr. Dehaene's team shows that approximate calculations take place in the brain's large-scale network involved in visual, spatial and analogical mental transformations.

It helps us learn to avoid distractions while concentrating on a task. Solving mental arithmetic problems requires our full attention.

The hippocampus saves the correct result in your long-term memory. As you get older, you only need a few specialized brain areas to solve the same problem. Your brain now works very efficiently.

How do some animals get enough nutrients to survive by only eat bugs or grass?,"Animals that get all their nutrition from grass and other plants are called herbivores. Herbivores are capable of digesting plant cells and getting to the nutrients locked inside, like protein. To do this, they have digestive systems that contain bacteria with the enzymes necessary to break down cellulose, the type of carbohydrate that helps make up plant cell walls[3]. This process is slow, and involves fermentation, which takes place in the enlarged stomach or an area in the intestine[4]. Insects are also herbivores and can get the necessary nutrients from eating different parts of plants, such as sap, leaves, wood, nectar, and pollen[5].","['Grass is not only difficult to digest, but time-consuming to eat. Many herbivores depend on grass for a majority of their diet, but grass doesn’t contain as much protein as meat does. A predator can get enough protein by eating perhaps only a handful of meaty meals a day. However, animals who eat grass must spend most of their day munching away on grass to get enough protein and other nutrients in their diet.', 'When you think of protein rich foods, you probably envision meat, eggs, beans and the like. However, animals that eat almost exclusively grass, such as cows and horses, have no problem getting enough protein in their diet. Unlike humans, herbivores are capable of digesting plant cells and getting to the nutrients locked inside, like protein.', 'Animals that get all their nutrition from grass and other plants are called herbivores. Herbivores are capable of something that humans aren’t: digesting cellulose. Cellulose is a type of carbohydrate that helps make up plant cell walls. These cell walls are rigid and hard to break down, making them difficult to digest, even for herbivores. Herbivores have digestive systems that contain bacteria that have the enzymes necessary to break down cellulose. Once the cells are broken down they can access proteins, sugar and fat locked inside plant cells.', 'Digesting cellulose to obtain protein isn’t a fast process. Herbivores use fermentation to break down the grass they eat. Monogastric animals have only one stomach. Monogastrics include horses, zebras and rabbits. Humans are monogastrics, but aren’t capable of using cellulose. Herbivores that eat grass and break down cellulose have enlarged stomachs or an area in the intestine where fermentation can take place in order to break down plant cells. They are classified as either foregut or hindgut fermenters depending on whether fermentation happens in the stomach or further along in the digestive tract.', 'Many insects are herbivores. Some, such as grasshoppers, will eat every part of a plant. Others specialize in certain parts of the plant. Aphids drink sap, a sticky fluid that carries nutrients through the plant. Caterpillars eat leaves. The larvae, or young wormlike forms, of root weevils feed on roots. Asian long-horned beetles tunnel deep into the heart of a tree and eat the wood there. Honeybees feed on nectar and pollen from flowers.']"
are Tesla electric cars actually more environmentally friendly when the battery disposal is taken into account?,"While Tesla electric cars are generally more sustainable than traditional cars with combustion engines due to their lower emissions per mile driven[1], their environmental impact also needs to be taken into account in terms of battery disposal and other factors. However, it is important to consider that electric cars don't just create pollution and carbon emissions in the same way as gasoline-powered cars[5], but they also have many of the same problems. Overall, electric cars are more environmentally friendly than gasoline-powered cars, but the impact of battery disposal should be taken into account when evaluating their environmental impact.","[""1.

What was the first thing to have blood in its body?,"The first thing to have blood in its body was likely an animal. In 1666, Richard Lower performed the first scientific report on transfusion by transfusing blood between two dogs[1]. In 1907, Jan Janský classified blood into the four types (A, B, AB, and O) that are still used today[4]. Even before then, in pre-modern times, blood was believed to have healing powers and was used as a source of medicine[3]. However, the study of blood did not acquire a truly scientific basis until the publication of William Harvey's ""An Anatomical Essay on the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals"" in 1628[5].","['Armed with that knowledge, physicians began to consider the possibility of blood transfusions. In 1666, at the Royal Society, in London, Richard Lower presented the first scientific report on transfusion; he had transfused blood between two dogs, using a goose quill to connect an artery in the neck of one to the jugular vein in the neck of the other. A year later, French physicians introduced blood from a calf into the vein of a young man. Believing the procedure safe, they repeated the experiment, and, as the blood entered the man, his pulse rose, sweat formed on his brow, and he complained of severe back pain. These symptoms suggest that his body, having developed antibodies against the calf’s blood after the first injection, was now rejecting it. Undeterred, the French doctors administered a third transfusion, and the man died shortly thereafter.', 'For millennia, the human body was understood as a vessel for a quartet of liquids: yellow bile, black bile, white phlegm, and red blood. Each corresponded to one of the four classical elements—fire, earth, water, and air—from which it was thought everything in the cosmos was made. According to the second-century physician Galen, blood was made in the liver from food and drink carried from the digestive tract. This “natural” blood entered the veins and was transported, ebbing and flowing, to all parts of the body. Blood was believed to be constantly consumed by tissues and then replenished at each meal. The primary function of the heart was to generate heat. Galen thought that the blood in the left side of the heart came directly from the right side through pores in the septum, or through leaks from the lungs. The blood in the arteries was “vital,” its purpose to deliver spiritus vitalus to the flesh.', 'In pre-modern times, blood was not only a target of treatment but also a source of medicine. Richard Sugg, in his remarkable book “Mummies, Cannibals and Vampires” (2011), traces the belief in blood’s healing powers back to ancient Rome. Drawing on a report by Pliny the Elder, he conjures a scene at the Colosseum:', 'The ABO blood group system was discovered in the year 1900 by Karl Landsteiner. Jan Janský is credited with the first classification of blood into the four types (A, B, AB, and O) in 1907, which remains in use today. In 1907 the first blood transfusion was performed that used the ABO system to predict compatibility. The first non-direct transfusion was performed on 27 March 1914. The Rhesus factor was discovered in 1937.', 'By then, the study of blood had begun to acquire a truly scientific basis. In 1628, Galen’s paradigm, which held that blood was produced from food, was dismantled by the publication of “An Anatomical Essay on the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals,” by the English physician William Harvey. Harvey’s revolutionary insight—that blood circulated from the left side of the heart through arteries and returned to the right side through veins—is often cited as the greatest single-handed discovery in medicine.']"
Why do Pandas breed so infrequently?,"Giant pandas are solitary animals and adults do not spend much time interacting outside of the breeding season. Captive pandas may not breed successfully due to the cubs being taken away from their mothers too early, lack of interest in mating due to lack of competition for the female, or difficulty in breeding due to lack of direct physical contact with keepers, access to climbable trees, and private areas away from public scrutiny. In the wild, intense competition for each female and the dominant male mating with her several times ensures successful pregnancies[3]. Despite Mei Xiang and Tian Tian having been given the opportunity to breed naturally nearly every breeding season, the panda team has never observed successful breeding from them[5].","['Giant pandas are solitary, and adults do not spend much time interacting outside of the breeding season. If we were to allow Mei Xiang and Tian Tian to spend time together before Mei Xiang was ready to breed, they would likely be aggressive toward each other. In the wild, a female would avoid males until she is ready to breed.', 'Scientists speculate that the awkward fumbling that sometimes occurs between captive pandas might be because the cubs were taken from their mothers too early and have never seen the deed done; lack of interest in mating might be attributed to lack of competition for the female.', 'In the wild, giant panda mating occurs just as nature specials would have you believe. There’s intense competition for each female, and the dominant male will mate with her several times to ensure success. And that strategy works: Wild female pandas generally give birth every two years. But that low birth rate means that captive breeding programs are essential to sustaining the endangered species. And in captivity, mating and successful pregnancies are tricky affairs—which is why it’s always a big deal when a cub is born, and devastating when one dies, as the 6-day-old cub at the National Zoo did last week.', 'We don’t really know what turns them on. Breeding some critters is easy, and zookeepers work to make sure they don’t reproduce too often. The endangered giant pandas happen to be quite finicky: Even a female in heat rarely elicits a response from a captive male panda. The reason for this remains unclear, but studies have shown that giant pandas breed most successfully when they’ve had direct physical contact with keepers, as well as access to climbable trees and private areas away from public scrutiny.', 'Mei Xiang and Tian Tian have been given the opportunity to breed naturally nearly every breeding season, but the panda team has never observed successful breeding from them.']"
Why does milk from mammals not spoil while inside of the animal?,"Milk from mammals does not spoil while inside of the animal because it contains antibodies that provide protection to the newborn baby as well as nutrients and growth factors[1]. Milk also contains lactose, which is not easily digested by bacteria, and thus prevents spoilage. The pH of the milk also increases to a point where the bacteria can no longer grow[3], and thus stops the milk from spoiling. If the milk is not discovered and thrown out, then other bacteria, yeasts, and molds can begin to multiply in the acid environment and cause the milk to spoil[4].","['In almost all mammals, milk is fed to infants through breastfeeding, either directly or by expressing the milk to be stored and consumed later. The early milk from mammals is called colostrum. Colostrum contains antibodies that provide protection to the newborn baby as well as nutrients and growth factors. The makeup of the colostrum and the period of secretion varies from species to species.', 'The consumption of milk between species is not unique to humans. Although the occurrence of this utilization is not vastly documented, interspecies consumption of milk has been observed among the red-billed oxpecker —a bird that can perch on the udders of an impala and suck its milk. Seagulls, Sheathbills, Skuas, Western Gulls and African feral cats have been reported to directly pilfer milk from the elephant seals’ teats.', 'Spoilage is a microbial joint endeavor. Milk is about 87 percent water, plus proteins, fats, minerals, and lactose (milk sugar), this last the root of the problem for most people unable to digest milk. Lactose is a feast, however, for residual Streptococci bacteria, which gobble it up and convert it into lactic acid. As lactic acid accumulates, the pH of milk increases to the point where Streptococci can no longer grow. A second class of bacteria, Lactobacilli, then steps up to the plate, similarly converting lactose to lactic acid until it, too, stewing in its own acidic juice, ceases to multiply. The rising acidity literally sours the milk, and causes the milk proteins to coagulate.', 'If the now steadily spoiling milk is not discovered and thrown out, yeasts and molds can then begin to multiply in the acid environment, and finally Bacilli begin to feed on the milk proteins, further boosting the pH and spewing out smelly ammonia-containing by-products. Milk, by this point, has gone from merely bad to worse. And if you drink it, it can make you sick.', 'Milk is the liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals, including humans. Breast milk is the preferred food for infants, as it is well-tolerated while their digestive tracts develop and mature. Dairy milk may be introduced at later ages if tolerated well. Although dairy milk may come from any mammal, cows, goats, buffalo, and sheep are common producers. This section will focus on dairy milk from cows, and briefly discuss non-dairy plant milk alternatives.']"
Why has there been so little action taken by Governments against Climate Change? Wouldn't the long term economic repercussions of inaction outweigh the short-term benefits of ignoring it?,"It is hard to get people to act on climate change because it is a trade-off between short-term and long-term benefits[4]. Ignoring climate change in the short term has benefits both to individuals and to organizations[1][4], such as not having to make changes in the cars they drive, or the products they buy, or the homes they live in. Companies can save money by relying on methods for generating power that involve combustion rather than developing and improving sources of green energy. Governments can also save money by not investing in green energy sources[1]. Despite the fact that taking climate action now makes good economic sense and can reduce our exposure to the worst economic risks from climate change[3], people overvalue benefits in the short term relative to benefits in the long term[1][4].","['Ignoring climate change in the short term has benefits both to individuals and to organizations. Individuals do not have to make changes in the cars they drive, the products they buy, or the homes they live in if they ignore the influence their carbon footprint has on the world.

Governments can save money today by relying on methods for generating power that involve combustion rather than developing and improving sources of green energy, even those that are more cost-effective in the long run.', 'It is doable. Taking climate action now makes good economic sense. The more we delay, the more we pay. We can promote economic growth, eradicate extreme poverty, and improve people’s health and well-being by acting today.', 'Our findings show that, if we continue on our current path, many regions of the U.S. face the prospect of serious economic effects from climate change. However, if we choose a different path—if we act aggressively to both adapt to the changing climate and to mitigate future impacts by reducing carbon emissions—we can significantly reduce our exposure to the worst economic risks from climate change, and also demonstrate global leadership on climate.', 'First, acting on climate change represents a trade-off between short-term and long-term benefits, which is the hardest trade-off for people to make. Decades of work on temporal discounting point out that we overvalue benefits in the short term relative to benefits in the long term. People don’t save enough money for retirement, preferring to spend money now rather than having it in their old age. People overeat in the present, despite the problems that obesity can cause in the future.', 'If people are motivated to avoid threats to their existence, why is it so hard to get people to act on climate change?']"
"since some planets are solid planets and some are gas planets, why aren't their liquid planets?","Gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn do not have solid surfaces, and the gas they contain is in a state above the ""critical point"" which means there is no sharp boundary between solid, liquid, and gas regions[1]. The outer gas planets do not have solid surfaces, but their moons do[2][3]. Astronomers think Jovian planets first formed as rocky and icy planets similar to terrestrial planets, but due to the size of their cores, they were able to grab hydrogen and helium out of the gas cloud from which the sun was condensing, before the sun formed and blew most of the gas away[4]. This means that when the moons spun off of these planets, they were too small to sustain themselves as just balls of gas, so the gas shrunk down and formed a solid thing[5]. Therefore, there are no liquid planets because planets that could have been liquid were too small to sustain themselves and cooled off to become solid.","['A: Gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn do not have solid surfaces in the sense that if you dropped in a penny, it would never land with a “clink.” These bodies are mostly composed of hydrogen at temperatures above the “critical point” for hydrogen, meaning there is no sharp boundary between solid, liquid, and gas regions.', ""The outer gas planets do not have solid surfaces, but their moons do. Most of these moons are rocky, icy worlds with a variety of surface features and compositions. Most of them are cratered, such as Europa, one of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter. Europa's surface is thought to consist of a thick layer of ice overlaying a liquid water ocean."", 'It took a very small person to ask a big question, one that planetary scientists pondered for a long time. There are four gas giants in our solar system – Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune – but why are their moons not made of gas?

why don't we use town gas to generate electricity to save money?,"Using town gas to generate electricity to save money is not a viable solution because natural gas and electricity for home heating have a similar environmental impact[2]. Additionally, most homes already have electrical service, meaning that converting homes to electric heating will have reduced costs once renewable electricity is available[3]. Furthermore, cities and towns have the power to mandate deep emission cuts by changing their building and energy codes, which is a more effective way of reducing emissions[4]. Finally, if cities do not require electric heating, this may result in a short-term reduction in emissions but the natural gas lines would need to be replaced eventually, wasting time and money[5].","['People with a low income are more likely to live in older buildings that aren’t required to upgrade. If widespread electrification causes gas companies to lose customers, residents who continue to use natural gas could be strapped with skyrocketing bills as utilities try to recoup millions invested in gas distribution networks.', 'Because of the heavy usage of dirty fossil fuels in electricity generation, there’s not a lot of difference between using natural gas and electricity for home heating in terms of environmental impact. The important thing, not only for the environment, but for your own bank account as well, is to increase your own home’s heating efficiency as much as possible. Whether you’re using natural gas or electric heating, there are a lot of ways to get more efficient. This includes upgrading to high efficiency equipment as well as making sure your home is insulated as tightly as possible and purchasing good windows and doors. Until our society moves to more renewable energy sources, the best way you can help as an individual is to use as little energy as possible!', 'As the world moves to more “renewable” electricity generation, homes with electric heating will be able to take advantage. If/when we’re able to generate electricity with only renewable sources, all-electric homes will have a very small relative carbon footprint. As an added advantage for electricity, virtually every home already has electrical service, meaning that once “renewable” electricity is available, the costs to convert homes to electric heating will be reduced because the fuel source will already be present in the home.', 'Real estate developers already have the technology to replace gas furnaces, water heaters and cooktops. And because cities and towns control building and energy codes, those codes are one of the few areas where municipalities have the power to mandate deep emission cuts.', 'It’s worth thinking about how cities would work towards zero emissions in buildings if they do not require electric heating. In this case, most new buildings would still get natural gas lines for heating. This may result in a short-term reduction in emissions, but the lines would need to be replaced once the grid becomes greener—a waste of time and money.']"

"Why do kids perceive vegetables to be less appetizing than other foods (ie meats, starches, etc)?","Kids may perceive vegetables to be less appetizing than other foods due to their texture, taste, and unfamiliarity. To encourage kids to eat vegetables, parents can offer small amounts of the vegetable with another food that the child likes[1], disguise vegetables in foods the child likes to eat[2][3][4], and get the child involved in planning and cooking family meals with vegetables[4].

Why do movies have different release dates in different countries?,"Movies have different release dates in different countries for a variety of reasons, including piracy control and global marketing, as well as to give the film the best chance of finding an audience[2][4]. Different countries also have different film markets, and some countries, like China, India, and Russia, have reliable release date data for only a small portion of films[2]. Additionally, simultaneous releases (where a film is released on multiple platforms on the same day[3]) can help studios create a co-branded marketing campaign around the launch of the movie, which can be beneficial to both the studio and the brand[5].","['Stephen, as usual – great article! You’ve hit the nail on the head as to the reason for the same-date or similar date releases that now occur with expected box office mega films. And that nail is… piracy control as well as global marketing. Piracy is the main push for issues in Asia to my understanding, as the mass amount of theft left way too many box office tickets off the sales registers.', 'I focused on these countries for my charts as they all fall in the chart of top ten film markets. I excluded the other top countries (China, India and Russia) as I could not find sufficient release data to make the results reliable. I also excluded Canada because the film industry sometimes includes it in the “North American” figures and sometimes treats it as an international territory. I found reliable Canadian release date data for 55% of my target films and I could not be sure if the remaining 45% were the same at the US (and therefore not reported) or just lost in the mists of time. This is a significant ‘unknown’ and so I opted to exclude them from my charts. Apologies to all Canadians, Canada-fans and mooses.', 'A simultaneous release, also known as a day-and-date release, is the release of a film on multiple platforms—most commonly theatrical and home video—on the exact same day, or in very close proximity to each other. This is in contrast to the industry standard of having a window of exclusivity (usually 90 days) between the theatrical and home video releases.', 'Distributors can shuffle release dates to give their films the best chance of finding an audience. Sometimes films are moved because they don’t want to compete with whatever Marvel is doing. Smaller films can get released on the same day as a blockbuster in hopes of finding a crowd who doesn’t want to see The Rock punching a skyscraper.', 'Not only does same-date release allow a studio to mount a major word-of-mouth AND social media (hey, it’s kinda the same) campaign around the film, matching advertising spend across all countries through traditional channels at well, it provides brand marketers a better ease to wrap their own marketing dollars around the film, and create a true co-branded marketing campaign around the specific launch period or targeted marketing period already alotted for the brand. A mobile phone partner that is going to release a new model isn’t staggering that release date in each country. Think of movies like Bond or Avengers… that mobile (or beer…or auto…or…) company is going to want shout from the tops of mountains NOW about the partnership, and not slooooowly push it out to market. In decades past, marketers would only concentrate on US marketing, as everything else was just too uncertain and spread apart. The movie studios are smart – they want to make everyone’s dollars better work for them.']"
How do Chinese finger traps work?,"Chinese finger traps work by trapping the user's fingers when they attempt to remove them. The more they try to pull away, the tighter the trap gets[1][4]. The secret to freeing one's fingers from the trap is counter-intuitive, they must push their fingers in[2][5]. This is analogous to negative emotions and bad memories, the harder a person tries to escape them, the tighter their grip on the person becomes. To free themselves, the person must allow themselves to fully experience the feeling, acknowledge the emotion, and let themselves fully experience the emotion[5]. Paradoxically, this will allow them to be free from the grip of the emotion or memory.[4][5]","['Share with them the idea of the Chinese finger trap. Get them to relax, not to focus all their attention on getting out. Have them notice how it feels.

Let me explain…', 'What happens when you place two fingers in a Chinese finger trap and pull away? You begin to feel the toy tightening around your fingers. As you pull harder the trap only gets tighter. It closes in and squeezes your fingers. Basically, the harder you try to get out of the darn thing the more of a grip it has! This is similar to emotions. The harder you try to escape the emotions of grief, depression, fear or anxiety the more of a grip those emotions will have. You try to pull away and pretend you aren’t angry, sad or afraid. You try to forget your grief or erase a trauma from your mind. For a brief moment you might even convince yourself that you are fine. And then it happens. The emotions begins to tighten around you. The harder you try to escape a memory or an emotion, the tighter it’s grip on you becomes. The unwanted emotion or trauma memory asserts itself in random moments…when you’re drifting off to sleep, when your talking to a friend or when you’re driving in your card.', 'The secret to removing your fingers from a finger trap is counter intuitive-you must push your finger in. Similarly, the best way to remove the grip of anxiety, fear, sadness, anger or a bad memory is to lean in. What does this mean? It means allowing yourself to fully experience the feeling. Instead of avoiding, sit with your feelings. Acknowledge the emotion. Let yourself fully experience the emotion. Paradoxically…the grip of that emotion or memory will begin to weaken just as pushing in on the finger trap allows your fingers to escape. You’ll find that the emotion or memory will still be there, but it won’t have the power any more-you’ll be free.']"
How do enzyme supplements retain functionality after being broken down in the digestive tract?,"Digestive enzyme supplements are broken down in the digestive tract and absorbed into the bloodstream, where they help to break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins from the foods you eat so that the nutrients can be absorbed into the body[4].

what is 'wrong' with GM crops?,"GM crops have several potential drawbacks. They denature the role of farmers by requiring them to purchase seeds from multinationals every new season, and forbid the farmers from improving the variety without paying expensive royalties[1]. GM crops can also be linked to intensive monoculture systems that wipe out other crop and ecosystems[3]. Furthermore, farmers are at risk of being sued by big corporations if their crops are accidentally contaminated with patented GM crops[4]. Lastly, some GM crops, such as Bt corn, are genetically modified to produce the insecticide Bt toxin, which can have unintended environmental consequences.","['GM crops denature the role of farmers, who have always improved and selected their own seeds.

how can carnivorous animals eat raw meat without becoming ill?,"Carnivorous animals can eat raw meat without becoming ill because of their robust immune systems, which have evolved to resist the various infections they could contract from bacteria[3]. However, it is not an absolute guarantee that they will not become sick from eating raw meat, as some animals do get ill from eating raw meat[4]. Furthermore, carnivores are less commonly eaten than herbivores due to the difficulty of keeping them healthy through their food source[1].","['This is a question I hear a lot, but to adequately answer it we’ll need to address some of the assumptions lying beneath it. First: Can animals eat raw meat without problems? The answer is no — plenty of animals contract diseases or, more commonly, parasites from eating the flesh of other animals. This is one reason that carnivores are eaten so much less commonly than herbivores: not only are they harder to keep and farm, but they are harder to keep healthy via their food source.', 'In the wild, carnivores hunt and kill prey to survive. From eating the flesh of other animals, these carnivores might develop some diseases. Even more commonly, they contract parasites. Nonetheless, they eat their meat raw because they quite obviously can’t cook it.', 'Animals in the wild can eat raw meat because of their robust immune system.

What would happen to animals that sleep during the winter if there where a sudden ice age?,"If there was a sudden ice age, animals that sleep during the winter would have to make adjustments to their hibernation strategies in order to survive. Hibernation is a great strategy for conserving energy, but it also comes with risks, such as the loss of muscle mass, changes to the microbiome, and even memory loss. The Sima people, our hominid predecessors, may have dealt with extreme cold hundreds of thousands of years ago by sleeping through the winter[4]. Bears, in particular, may have to rethink their hibernation strategies as the climate warms and winters become shorter[5].","['Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London pointed out that large mammals such as bears do not actually hibernate, because their large bodies cannot lower their core temperature enough. Instead they enter a less deep sleep known as torpor. In such a condition, the energy demands of the human-sized brains of the Sima people would have remained very large, creating an additional survival problem for them during torpor.', 'For warm-blooded animals that don’t migrate, one way to survive the winter is to sleep through it. Hibernation is a great strategy that enables animals to conserve energy when food is scarce. During hibernation, body temperature drops, breathing and heart rate slows, and most of the body’s metabolic functions are put on hold in a state of quasi-suspended animation.', 'While a human can lie in bed for a week before muscles begin to atrophy and blood clots form, hibernators will endure months without moving. During hibernation, the microbiome – the community of bacteria living in an animal’s digestive tract – is battered by cold and the sudden lack of food. Hibernators’ lungs become covered with a thick deposit of mucus and collagen like those seen in people with asthma, and their brains show changes that resemble those of early-stage Alzheimer’s. Some species lose memory during hibernation. Most surprising of all, some show symptoms of sleep deprivation when they finally wake. And yet, hibernators are able to counter all of these issues to bounce back in spring, often without any long-term ill effects.', 'Evidence from bones found at one of the world’s most important fossil sites suggests that our hominid predecessors may have dealt with extreme cold hundreds of thousands of years ago by sleeping through the winter.', 'Bears, too, will have to rethink their concept of hibernation as the climate warms and winters grow shorter. How they respond will say much about their commitment to winter naps, and about the deep interconnections between climate and animal behavior.']"

They can also increase the metabolic resting rate, suppress fat tissue growth[2], inhibit enzymes that break down serotonin, the calming neurotransmitter, and enzymes that disrupt the production of dopamine, the feel-good hormone[5]. Additionally, they can decrease depression symptoms by significantly elevating serotonin levels in the brain[5].","['Spices like cinnamon, turmeric, garlic, ginger, and cumin, as well as peppers and chili, host many health benefits. Hot and/or spicy foods can even increase two feel-good chemicals in the body — endorphins and dopamine. This may just explain that spicy food craving you can’t kick. Along with corn, tomatoes, and beans, the early Europeans explorers brought back some of the peppers from Latin America - the only place they grew at that time - and introduced the plant to the rest of the world, where it took off like wildfire.', '1. Weight. Numerous studies indicates that certain spices — like cumin, cinnamon, turmeric, peppers, and chilies — can raise your metabolic resting rate and slow down the appetite. One study also found that turmeric suppressed fat tissue growth in mice.', 'Black pepper has great effects on brain health. The piperine in the pepper inhibits one enzyme that breaks down serotonin, the calming neurotransmitter. This enzyme also degrades the functioning of another hormone called melatonin – which regulates the sleep/wake cycle.', 'Piperine also has its importance in Parkinson’s disease. It inhibits another type of enzyme that disrupts the production of dopamine, the feel-good hormone. Dopamine is usually deficient in patients with Parkinson’s, and ingesting black pepper can ease the symptoms. Similar effects can be observed in the case of depression too.', 'Black pepper’s antioxidant abilities were further tested against number of neural disorders including depression and various forms of dementia. Piperine is again at the research forefront showing great benefit for people suffering from depression. Piperine inhibits an enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) which breaks down serotonin and dopamine—the calming and feel-good neurotransmitters.  Low levels of both of these neurotransmitters are the key markers of several neural diseases including depression, Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy. The treatments often focus on increasing dopamine and serotonin in the brain, resulting in greater cognition, better mood and increased ability against neurological decay.  Animal studies showed that piperine was able to do just that, and decrease depression symptoms by significantly elevating serotonin levels in hippocampus, hypothalamus and frontal cortex portions of the brain.

"As you enter your adult age and older, does your body stop absorbing calcium and other important nutrients from milk?","While it is true that the gut tends to absorb less calcium with age[1], there is no evidence that it completely stops absorbing calcium from milk and other important nutrients. In fact, it is important for older adults to get adequate calcium and vitamin D intake in their diet (milk, cheese, yogurt). Bones are constantly being remodeled every day, and calcium moves in and out of them. In older adults, especially in post-menopausal women, bone is broken down at a faster rate than it's built[3]. Although many people think of calcium in the diet as good protection for their bones, there is some evidence that higher dairy product consumption can actually increase fracture risk[4]. That being said, the RDA for calcium for postmenopausal women is higher than at younger ages[5].","['Human and animal studies have found that the gut tends to absorb less calcium with age (20, 21, 22, 23).', 'Many older adults have common risks that make bone health worse. Calcium intake in the diet (milk, cheese, yogurt) is low. Vitamin D levels are low and gut calcium absorption is low. In many adults, hormonal signals have to take some calcium out of the bones every day to keep blood calcium levels normal. This contributes to bone loss.', ""Bones are constantly being remodeled every day, and calcium moves in and out of them. In children and adolescents, the body builds new bone faster than it breaks down old bone so total bone mass increases. This continues until about age 30, when new bone formation and old bone breakdown start occurring at about the same rate. In older adults, especially in post-menopausal women, bone is broken down at a faster rate than it's built. If calcium intake is too low, this can contribute to osteoporosis."", 'The bone-thinning condition called osteoporosis can lead to small and not-so-small fractures. Although many people think of calcium in the diet as good protection for their bones, this is not at all the whole story. In fact, in a 12-year Harvard study of 78,000 women, those who drank milk three times a day actually broke more bones than women who rarely drank milk.1Similarly, a 1994 study of elderly men and women in Sydney, Australia, showed that higher dairy product consumption was associated with increased fracture risk. Those with the highest dairy product consumption had approximately double the risk of hip fracture compared to those with the lowest consumption.2', 'Because the results of some large trials found that higher calcium intakes (usually achieved with a supplement) was associated with improved bone density and slightly lower risk of hip fractures, the RDA for calcium for postmenopausal women is higher than at younger ages.  Some studies suggest that frail elderly (80 years and older living in institutions) may benefit from supplementation more than “younger” elderly who live independently in the community. ']"
Why are milk and egg prices so low right now?,"Egg prices are currently low due to the spread of an avian influenza virus which started in early 2022 and has already affected more birds than the 2015 outbreak[2], as well as an increase in egg consumption which has outpaced red meats[3]. Inflation and an increase in feed prices due to the war in Ukraine, as well as the shrinking number of layer chickens in the US[5], are also causes of the current low egg prices[5]. Milk prices are low due to uncertainty about when the egg crisis could ebb[4][5].","['In a report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that tracks food price outlook, eggs have risen up to 59% in December 2022, the highest year over year rise in prices among food items.', 'The main reason egg prices remain high is the spread of an avian influenza virus which started in early 2022 and has already affected more birds than the 2015 outbreak, according to the Centers for Disease Control.', 'Consumer eating habits also play a part in the sudden rise in egg prices as egg consumption has risen 17% between 2012 and 2021 according to a report from the USDA and has even outpaced red meats.', 'For Devore and many others, the new egg crisis, combined with uncertainty about when it could ebb, has been more unsettling than the gradual price creep of dairy products, flour and produce.', ""Egg prices are already on the rise, according to the USDA Egg Market Report, from a low point of about $1.40 per dozen in March 2022 to a national average of $3.26 in January 2023, when the most recent report was released.

Why are humans the only animals who can't eat uncooked meat?,"Humans are the only animals who can't eat uncooked meat because they need to process and store the meat for later consumption, whereas animals in the wild eat their prey right after they kill it[2].

Furthermore, even though humans can in many cases eat raw meat, they will have a much harder time doing so than a lion or tiger[5].","['Animals, especially wild ones, don’t choose to eat raw meat; they consume it because that’s what’s available. Animals in the wild can’t choose to have their meat prepared for them, and most of them will die without ever tasting cooked protein. The same can’t be said for domesticated animals or pets under our care.', 'One critical reason animals can eat raw meat is that they eat the meat while it is fresh. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, as seen with the vultures. Unlike humans, wild animals eat their prey right after they kill it.

Let’s start with the short version.', 'The second assumption is that we, humans, cannot eat raw meat. This is also untrue. A blue rare steak is functionally raw everywhere but the edges, and steak tartare is literally nothing but raw, spiced beef. It’s not so much that we can’t eat raw meat — as it is, raw meat is quite risky, and for the exact same reasons as for a lion. The major difference between us and a lion is that a lion tends to chow down immediately after the kill; only humans have taken to storing meat for long periods of time, applying the squirrel’s hoarding strategy to flesh. Most problems with meat, from parasites to simple chemical rot, become more dangerous the longer the flesh has been rotting.', 'But even though humans can in many cases eat raw meat you will have a much harder time doing so than a lion or tiger.']"
Why are almost all of Reddits's comments people trying to make jokes?,"Reddit is a social media site that is known for its nihilism, obfuscating humor, and a clear common goal[2].

Concerns about stealth advertising also run rampant on the site, to the point where even an incidental mention of a brand can arouse suspicion. All of this is compounded by how easy it is for rumors and speculation to spread through Reddit’s comments sections, meaning that a reputation can be stained by a single bad post. Unsurprisingly, promoting a product on Reddit can be exceptionally difficult.', 'A potent mixture of nihilism, obfuscating humor and a clear common goal was paired with “a kind of lock-step moderation that adheres very closely to the Reddit terms of service,” said Ms. Swartz. “Anyone who has ever done any type of moderation knows that it’s really hard to sustain a healthy community. It’s really hard to keep everyone happy and to moderate,” Ms. Swartz said. “If your goal isn’t to create a healthy discussion community, but rather to make power and memes that can spin out elsewhere, that’s quite a bit easier.” The_Donald eventually became an administrative nightmare for Reddit, all but breaking the site.

Why can't we domesticate other wild animals?,"Domestication is the process of taking a wild species and genetically altering them to be more tolerant of humans and to fit a lifestyle that is beneficial to us. This is done through selective breeding, and is different from taming a single wild animal[5]. Domestic animals become smaller and dumber than their wild counterparts, as they no longer need to expend energy on finding food and the food they are given is usually of lower quality[3]. Humans usually domesticate animals for food, work, or companionship[5]. Other wild animals cannot be domesticated because the process requires a lot of time and effort, and the animals need to be genetically predisposed to being tolerant of humans.","['Dogs, sheep, pigs, cows, horses - all these animals and more have been fundamentally changed by humans to make our lives better. Domestication has fundamentally altered the course of human history, reshaping the land and other species to fit our new agricultural lifestyle. But how do you take a wild species and turn them into domesticated helpers? Why can animals like dogs or horses be domesticated while their close relatives like foxes and zebras remain stubbornly wild?', 'Domestication is not the same as taming. A domestic animal is genetically determined to be tolerant of humans. An individual wild animal, or wild animal born in captivity, may be tamed—their behavior can be conditioned so they grow accustomed to living alongside humans—but they are not truly domesticated and remain genetically wild.', ""As a general rule, domesticated species become smaller and dumber than their wild counterparts. The underlying causes of this are simple enough. Domesticated animals expend little to no energy on gathering food, and while they always have food, it's generally of a lower quality than what they could find in the wild. This means there's no reason for the animals to grow particularly big, although they often become quite fat."", ""Before we go on, it's crucial to distinguish between domestication and taming. A single wild animal can be tamed if it is captured at a young age and raised with a lot of careful human nurturing. But this is strictly an acquired trait, and a single taming does not suddenly make the entire species domesticated. And, on the other hand, it is possible for a domesticated animal to return to the wild, although then it's a feral species, not a wild one."", ""Domestication is when humans take a plant or animal species and, through selective breeding, transform the species into something beneficial for humans. Historically, there have been three major reasons why humans domesticate. The first is to create a ready source of food, such as taking the wild ancestors of cows and turning them into cattle. The second is to harness animals for work, which can range from transportation to use in war, with horses being the most obvious example of this. Then there's domestication that creates pets and companions for humans - dogs are a great example of this.""]"
how deli meats at the grocery store come in huge chunks without bones,"Deli meats at the grocery store come in huge chunks without bones because they are made from multiple pieces of meat restructured to look like one whole piece[1].

why do Christians say (while officiating marriage) 'man and wife' and not woman/husband or husband/wife etc,"Christians say 'man and wife' when officiating a marriage because they view it as a bond of union created by God that is intended to reflect His covenant with humankind[2]. Additionally, saying 'man and wife' when officiating a marriage is a way of demonstrating to other Christians and non-Christians the couple's commitment to living together as husband and wife and honoring God's instructions on the sanctity of the union of man and woman[2][3]. Furthermore, Christian Egalitarians believe that Christian marriage is intended to be a marriage without any hierarchy, emphasizing that nowhere in the New Testament is there a requirement for a wife to obey her husband[1][4].","['The Christian Egalitarian view of marriage asserts that gender, in and of itself, neither privileges nor curtails a believer\'s gifting or calling to any ministry in the church or home. It does not imply that women and men are identical or undifferentiated, but affirms that God designed men and women to complement and benefit one another. A foundational belief of Christian Egalitarians is that the husband and wife are created equally and are ordained of God to ""become one"", a biblical principle first ordained by God in Genesis 2, reaffirmed by Jesus in Matthew 19 and Mark 10, and by the Apostle Paul in Ephesians 5. Therefore, they see that ""oneness"" as pointing to gender equality in marriage. They believe the biblical model for Christian marriages is therefore for the spouses to share equal responsibility within the family—not one over the other nor one under the other.', 'Genesis 2:24 tells us God created man and woman to become “one flesh” when they marry, not two separate beings who go their own separate ways. There is a unity in marriage that is unique and holy. Moreover, marriage is the picture of Christ and His church (believers) as described in Ephesians 5:31-32. The marriage covenant between a man and a woman is symbolic of the covenant between Christ and those for whom He died. His is an everlasting covenant and one that is holy and sacred, just as marriage is to be holy, sacred and unbroken. This unity of two people into one reaches its most sacred in the spiritual realm, where the two are to be of one mind regarding the basic doctrines of Christianity – God, Christ, sin, salvation, heaven/hell, etc. This unity of understanding through the ministry of the Holy Spirit unites a husband and wife in a bond unlike any other on earth.', 'Christians are to “be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody” (Rom. 12:17b) and also to conduct themselves in a manner that honors God. If a Christian couple starts living together after making a personal but not a public commitment, that is not going to appear right in the eyes of everyone. In fact, it looks like fornication and is a very poor witness to both other Christians and non-Christians. Many people reject Christianity because they think Christians are hypocrites, but the marriage ceremony lets everyone know of the couple’s intent to live together as husband and wife, and that they are also honoring God’s instructions on the sanctity of the union of man and wife.', 'Christian Egalitarians (from the French word ""égal"" meaning ""equal"") believe that Christian marriage is intended to be a marriage without any hierarchy—a full and equal partnership between the wife and husband. They emphasize that nowhere in the New Testament is there a requirement for a wife to obey her husband. While ""obey"" was introduced into marriage vows for much of the church during the Middle Ages, its only New Testament support is found in Peter 3, with that only being by implication from Sarah\'s obedience to Abraham.: p.190  Scriptures such as Galatians 3:28 state that in Christ, right relationships are restored and in him, ""there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female.""', 'Many Methodist Christians teach that marriage is ""God\'s gift and covenant intended to imitate God\'s covenant with humankind"" that ""Christians enter in their baptism.""

"Are animals, or I guess anything that isn’t human, aware of the concept of time?

They’re much more aware, compared to humans. Modern day humans go outside and don’t see, hear or sense very well. Our senses have dulled over thousands of years of civilization and settled living. I think that an animal’s experience of life is much sharper and clearer.

If you watch mammals or even birds, you will see how they respond to the world. They play. They act frightened when there’s danger. They relax when things are good. It seems illogical for us to think that animals might not be having a conscious mental experience of play, sleep, fear or love.', 'If you’re having a mental experience, you are conscious.

How do cows produce milk throughout the entire year since most mammals stop after a certain period of time after giving birth?,"Cows are put through a yearly cycle of forcible impregnation, birth, and lactation to produce milk[2].

why do some find human euthanasia so objectionable while they seem to have no problem with it for their pets?,"One of the main reasons why some people find human euthanasia so objectionable while having no problem with it for their pets is because animals cannot interpret the act as being wrong[1]. Humans have language and can form desires about what they may want in the future, so euthanasia for them is seen as a violation of their interests[1]. Another reason is that some people view active euthanasia as wrong, while passive euthanasia is permissible, and the slippery slope argument is used to oppose it[2]. Additionally, human euthanasia is illegal in most countries, while it is an established part of veterinarian practice[3], and it is sometimes seen as a way to eliminate potentially dangerous animals or to reduce the financial burden of livestock-attacking dogs[4]. Finally, some owners may feel like ""murderers"" when consenting to euthanasia, as it may be seen as an act of commission akin to pulling a trigger, or it may be the result of the distress of the animal's death.[1][5]","['Why should this be important in euthanasia decisions? If wrong is done to animals, they cannot interpret the act as being wrong; their “interests” have not been violated. In other words, without language, animals cannot form desires about what they may want to do in the future; they, therefore, cannot take an interest in it. This leads Frey to conclude that the obligation of humans is only to be kind to the animals. For euthanasia, this means that the pet owner’s interests always come before those of the pet; the pet owner has the right to end the pet’s life so long as its death is painless. As a former owner of a dog that experienced a long and very expensive decline in its health, I can see some merit to Frey’s argument. To have put my dog’s interests above my own would have unfairly forced my family and I to suffer monetary stresses. If my dog had no real interest in the future, then no harm would have occurred in ending its life at any point.', 'The first objection is that the arguments (again) assume too much. They simply presuppose that active euthanasia is wrong and that passive euthanasia is permissible, and it would be much better if arguments could be found which did not rely on such controversial assumptions. For many people when presented with the slippery slope argument outlined above will simply say that what’s at the bottom of the slope (the acceptance of active euthanasia) is not in fact a bad consequence, but rather a good one.', 'Euthanasia is an established part of veterinarian practice. The “good death” (Greek “eu” and “thanatos”) is meant to bring relief to animals and their owners. Nevertheless, many veterinarians consider it to be one of the profession’s major burdens, and many owners of companion animals feel overwhelmed by the need to make a decision on behalf of vulnerable individuals. On the one hand, the phenomenon of moral stress  and the alarmingly high suicide rate among veterinarians are often associated with their professional obligation to kill their patients [2,3,4]. This, on the other hand, is not reflected in the concept of euthanasia as a powerful tool that has been at the veterinarians’ (while not at the human medical doctors’: Human euthanasia is illegal in most countries. Exceptions are Benelux, Canada, and Colombia.) disposal for good reasons.', 'Additionally, there are cases of public interest, such as the elimination of potentially dangerous animals, the killing of surplus animals in laboratories and shelters or the financial burden of livestock-attacking dogs. There is a broad spectrum of views on many animal-related issues, such as animal research and testing, breeding of certain breeds, killing animals in shelters, etc. However, we refer to procedures that are performed for financial reasons or safety reasons and thereby supposedly in the interest of the public. Here, neither the owner nor the companion animal has an interest in ending the animal’s life, but societal aspects justify what is still subsumed under “euthanasia”. For those reasons, it can be helpful to establish a new terminology, including cases of morally justifiable killing which are not cases of euthanasia .', 'While there are no published studies suggesting that veterinarians and staff feel like executioners, a survey of 177 veterinary clients in Ontario reported that 16 per cent agreed with the statement that “I felt like a murderer having my pet euthanased” . Without additional information, it is difficult to know why these owners felt that this analogy was appropriate. Was it simply because consenting to euthanasia was understood as an act of commission akin to pulling a trigger? Was it because they felt that euthanasia was not, in fact, in their animal’s interests? Was the animal’s death distressing? Or was the selection of this response to a survey question a manifestation of grief?']"

how do animals with dense furs get vitamin D?,"Animals with dense furs are unable to absorb vitamin D directly from the sun due to their fur coverage[4]. Instead, they get it from licking their fur, which transfers small quantities of vitamin D stored externally into the digestive system, enabling the animals to process vitamin D internally[3]. Some animals may also get vitamin D from eating fish[2], and grass and hay is a good vitamin D source for animals[2][3]. However, animals with fur need vitamin D for different reasons than humans[5].","['Vitamin D deficiency is a common problem in many parts of the world. One way that animals have evolved to get vitamin D is by licking their fur. The sun will cause the animal’s skin to produce vitamin D, which will then be transferred into its fur and licked off by the animal.', 'So for many, it is a mystery how they get vitamin D without going to the vet and getting shots! Some scientists have an idea though: when they lick their fur, it rubs off on them and gets absorbed through their skin. Other animals like seals also store vitamin d from eating fish with it.', 'Grass and hay is a good vitamin D source, but furry and feathered creatures have another way of getting their vitamin D. Although their coverage prevents them from absorbing the UV vitamin D directly, the act of grooming, namely the plucking of feathers and licking of fur, transfers small quantities of vitamin D stored externally into the digestive system, enabling the animals to process vitamin D internally.', 'Fur covering the skin of an animal, much like clothing covering the skin of a human, limits the amount of vitamin D absorbed from sunlight. A study on cows conducted at Aarhus University in Denmark found that cows with less fur coverage on the body had more vitamin D-producing plasma after exposure to the sun, suggesting that animals with fur-covered bodies were less capable and less likely to synthesize a sufficient amount of the vitamin from sun exposure.', 'It’s a well-known fact that humans need vitamin D to maintain good health, but what about animals with fur? It turns out that they also need it – but not for the same reasons.']"
Why are there so many ladybugs in my house when spring comes around? And how did they get inside?,"Ladybugs typically enter homes in the spring in search of a warm and dry place to overwinter[4]. They can travel inside via houseplants, and when one ladybug finds its way inside, it can signal to other ladybugs by releasing pheromones, or scented chemical flares[2]. It is possible that many of the ladybugs in your house are actually Asian lady beetles, which seek warmth when the weather starts to cool down[1]. Additionally, they may have been hibernating under the sliding of the house or apartment and the warmer temperatures have caused them to emerge in the wrong direction[5].","['According to Damiano, it might not be native ladybugs that are swarming the insides of houses. Instead, the bugs might be Asian lady beetles, and when the weather starts to cool down, the bugs seek warmth.', 'Why the colonies? When one ladybug finds its way inside, it has a way of signaling to others and drawing them indoors too. Adult ladybugs can release pheromones, or scented chemical flares that attract other ladybugs nearby. This chemical signal creates a trail that invites other ladybugs in via the same path the first ladybug used. This can also lead them to cluster in one location in your home. In spring, you may see ladybugs that hid inside for the winter reemerging near bright doors and windows.', 'Ladybugs can also travel inside via houseplants, especially those that you transfer from the outdoor porch to the living room before the winter. Once they’re inside, they may use their chemical secretions to attract the rest of a colony.', ""Ladybugs find their way inside because they're looking for a shelter in which to overwinter. That means they're searching for someplace warm and dry where they can wait out the cold season, and our cozy homes are perfect for this purpose. You'll occasionally find only one ladybug wandering around inside, but it's also possible to find many. You'll notice these so-called colonies of ladybugs scattered around your home or clustered together in one space, usually nestled in corners of attics or basements or near doors and windows."", 'They have probably been hibernating under the sliding of the house or apartment and the warmer temperatures have caused them to emerge- it’s just that they are going in the wrong direction. You would think that they would be trying to get out of the house, but they are coming in. It happens. This happens because of the variation in temperatures from the interior of the home verses the outside temperatures. The ladybugs are merely confused.

"Why is there such a large amount of rain falling across Australia, when it is meant to be an El Nino year and be very dry?","Australia is experiencing a large amount of rain this year despite it being an El Niño year due to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) [1,2,3,4], which is a climate phenomenon centred in the tropical Pacific Ocean. El Niño events are usually associated with drought in Australia, but this year, La Niña events have been driving stronger easterly trade winds from the Pacific towards Australia, thus increasing moisture in the country [2]. Additionally, clusters of La Niña events over longer timescales, such as the 1950s and 1970s, have been associated with eastern Australia's wettest decades [5].","['A major driver for rainfall variability in Australia is the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, a phenomenon centred in the tropical Pacific Ocean. During an El Niño year, the waters of the equatorial eastern and central Pacific warm above their usual levels, easterly winds in the tropics weaken, and drought often affects eastern and northern Australia, especially in winter and spring. This is the main growing season for Australia’s winter crops such as wheat and barley, and the main filling season for south-east Australia’s major water storages.', 'Through La Niña years the eastern seaboard of Australia records above-average rainfall usually creating damaging floods due to stronger easterly trade winds from the Pacific towards Australia, thus increasing moisture in the country. Conversely, El Niño events will be associated with a weakening, or even a setback, of the prevailing trade winds, and this, results in reduced atmospheric moisture in the country. Many of the worst bushfires in Australia accompany ENSO events, and can be exacerbated by a positive Indian Ocean Dipole, where they would tend to cause a warm, dry and windy climate. The Bureau of Meteorology features an alert system for the El Niño–Southern Oscillation.', ""El Niño's effect on Australian rainfall decreases after November, particularly in the southeast, and therefore a pronounced difference between the rainfall patterns of early and late summer would exist. Nonetheless, Cape York and northwest Tasmania would have moderately dry conditions. Some areas on the Queensland/New South Wales border exhibit a small inclination for wetter conditions. There is also a reasonably stronger propensity for wetter than average conditions in the southeast of Western Australia."", 'Effects of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation in Australia is present across most of Australia, particularly the north and the east, and is one of the main climate drivers of the country. Associated with seasonal abnormality in many areas in the world, Australia is one of the continents most affected and experiences extensive droughts alongside considerable wet periods that cause major floods. There exist three phases — El Niño, La Niña, and Neutral, which help to account for the different states of ENSO. Since 1900, there have been 27 El Niño and 18 La Niña events in Australia. The events usually last for 9 to 12 months, but some can persist for two years, though the ENSO cycle generally operates over a time period from one to eight years.', 'These climate drivers influence our rainfall over longer timescales too. While individual El Niño events or abnormal Indian Ocean conditions rarely last for more than a year, a cluster of events in rapid succession can drive anomalies over much longer periods. Eastern Australia’s wettest decades, such as the 1950s and 1970s, occurred when there were several La Niña events within the space of 10 years or so.']"
Why do people sound like their respective gender even if they have a high/low voice?,"People sound like their respective gender even if they have a high/low voice because voice gender perception can be thought of as a mixture of low-level perceptual feature extraction and higher-level cognitive processes[1]. Research has suggested that low voices, ""masculine"" voices, are an asset to those seeking leadership roles, in politics and beyond[2]. This bias could be a consequence of lower-pitched female voices being perceived as more competent, stronger, and more trustworthy[2][3]. For women with a voice that sounds like a man, it could also be because of the unnecessary force used in the voice projection[3][4]. Furthermore, regardless of gender, the lower-pitched voice was deemed more authoritative than the higher[5].","['Voice gender perception can be thought of as a mixture of low-level perceptual feature extraction and higher-level cognitive processes. Although it seems apparent that voice gender perception would rely on low-level pitch analysis, many lines of research suggest that this is not the case. Indeed, voice gender perception has been shown to rely on timbre perception and to be categorical, i.e., to depend on accessing a gender model or representation. Here, we used a unique combination of acoustic stimulus manipulation and mathematical modeling of human categorization performances to determine the relative contribution of pitch and timbre to this process. Contrary to the idea that voice gender perception relies on timber only, we demonstrate that voice gender categorization can be performed using pitch only but more importantly that pitch is used only when timber information is ambiguous (i.e., for more androgynous voices).', 'Study after study has suggested that low voices, ""masculine"" voices, are an asset to those seeking leadership roles, in politics and beyond. And that\'s so in part because we don\'t simply think of vocal pitch--the physical trait determined by the size of one\'s larynx and the length and mass of one\'s vocal folds--in terms of physicality. We prefer low voices because, we assume, voices say something far beyond the words they convey: We perceive men with lower-pitched voices to be more attractive and physically stronger--and also more competent and more trustworthy--than their less burly-voiced peers. And we perceive women with lower-pitched voices along the same lines (though we also tend to perceive them, tellingly, as less attractive than their Betty Boop-y counterparts).', 'So why would this be? Is our discrimination against high-pitched voices so deeply ingrained that we apply it indiscriminately? On the one hand: Yes, maybe. ""In the case of women\'s voices,"" the study notes, ""this bias could be a consequence of lower-pitched female voices being perceived as more competent, stronger, and more trustworthy. That is, these traits are perceived as positive in the context of leadership and could be the mechanism that leads us to prefer female leaders with lower voices."" But the preference for lower voices could also reflect another bias, too: toward age, and all that comes with it. The pitch of the female voice declines over a woman\'s lifespan, the authors point out--meaning that a low female voice might also indicate an older owner. In other words, ""men and women may be biased to select older women as leaders, regardless of the type of position in question.""', 'For women with a voice that sounds like a man, it could also be because of the unnecessary force used in the voice projection. In this case, the voice will sound too heavy and forceful, which is not a quality of a female voice by the unconscious common opinion in our society.', 'And they were also, it turns out, debunking that assumption. The low-pitched voices won the day, despite the fact that those voices were seeking ""feminine"" leadership roles. ""The preference is, indeed, consistent,"" the authors put it: ""Regardless of social context, and regardless even of gender, the lower-pitched voice was deemed more authoritative than the higher. As in previous studies, men and women preferred female candidates with masculine voices. Likewise, men preferred men with masculine voices. Women, however, did not discriminate between male voices.""']"

Sources of Emotions in Humans and Animals,"Sources of emotions in humans and animals include research that suggests many animals may experience emotions such as joy, fear, love, despair, and grief[1][2], as well as studies that are helping scientists understand certain psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)[3]. To study emotions in animals, scientists need to set aside their own perceptions of what people typically think of as emotions[4]. Human emotions are conscious experiences which we name and categorize[5], and research suggests that animals may be able to experience something similar and how this impinges on the quality of their lives.[5]","['Marc Bekoff, Animal Emotions: Exploring Passionate Natures: Current interdisciplinary research provides compelling evidence that many animals experience such emotions as joy, fear, love, despair, and grief—we are not alone, BioScience, Volume 50, Issue 10, October 2000, Pages 861–870, https://doi.org/10.1641/0006-3568(2000)050[0861:AEEPN]2.0.CO;2', 'Do elephants feel joy, chimpanzees grief and depression, and dogs happiness and dejection?

Why do retail and restaurant businesses make a weekly ever changing schedule? Wouldn't it be easier to give everyone consistent hours?,"Retail and restaurant businesses make a weekly ever changing schedule to be able to accommodate for last-minute changes in shipment dates, marketing, and leadership visits[5]. These changes can require extra hours and can wreak havoc with a posted schedule[5]. Additionally, having a weekly ever changing schedule is favored by many Americans, as it can be difficult to budget and manage a second job when you cannot confirm your availability[4]. Consistency is also key when it comes to earning and retaining employee trust[3].","[""Retail and restaurant work is notorious for irregular scheduling and last-minute changes — factors that can harm workers' lives and the well-being of their families."", 'Predictable scheduling is not just good policy, it’s also good politics. A June New York Times/CBS News poll found that 72 percent of Americans favor requiring chain stores and fast-food outlets to give workers at least two weeks’ notice of any changes in their work schedules or provide them with extra pay. Such a policy enjoys the support of 62 percent of Republicans and 72 percent of independents.', 'Consistency is key when it comes to earning and retaining employee trust. Servers, cooks, and hosts want to know when they can expect to see the weekly schedule. If it’s posted at the same time each week, they can get into a routine.

Continuing an education to gain new skills can also be tough if your schedule changes weekly.

You can’t do both.”', 'Store managers consistently identified three ways HQ created schedule instability. Last-minute changes in shipment dates or inaccuracies in the number of units meant that a store received 5,000 units on Thursday instead of the 2,000 units it had been told to expect on Tuesday; this wreaked havoc with posted schedules. Last-minute changes in marketing meant that merchandise had to be marked down, tables set up, stock moved around, signs made, windows changed — and sometimes there were three different promotions in a single week. The third was leadership visits, which meant extra hours were spent ensuring the store looked perfect. To quote one manager, “If payroll is such a commodity, I feel it’s crucial to spend it on the business versus visits. This isn’t a museum. You know we aren’t curating a museum.” All meant that hours had to be added here and subtracted there, after the schedule was posted.']"
Is animal milk healthy for adults? Or is it harmful?,"The evidence is mixed on whether or not adult consumption of animal milk is healthy.

Why hasn't there been a concerted effort to create cities or large communities underwater?,"Building cities or large communities underwater has not been a concerted effort due to the high cost and technological challenges associated with such a project.

In addition, many cities, such as Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, have inadequate storm water drainage, sewage, and piping systems which make their residents highly vulnerable to climate impacts[3]. In addition, developers need to build neighborhoods that are resilient in the face of climate change, which can be a challenge[4].

What was the American Revolution and Civil War? Are they connected?,"The American Revolution (1775-1783) was a war fought between Great Britain and the original 13 colonies, caused by colonial resentment of British taxes and strict, impractical rules and regulations, and eventually led to the development of the United States as an independent nation[4]. The American Civil War (1861-1865) was a war between the Union (almost all northern and western states) and the Confederate States of America (almost all southern states), primarily over the practice of slavery[4]. While the two conflicts are not directly connected, the ideals of the American Revolution and the patriotism of the Civil War soldiers was heavily influenced by their ancestors and the historical landscapes of the Revolutionary War[1][2]. It has also been suggested that the American Revolution can be viewed as a Civil War[3][5].","['Civil War soldiers’ connections to the ideals of the American Revolution grew even stronger when their marches and battles brought them close to and even directly onto the landscapes and landmarks sacred to the memory of the American Revolution. On these landscapes, soldiers were quick to identify the cause of the Revolution as their own. Nowhere was this more evident than in Virginia, where the physical geography of the two conflicts overlapped so significantly. As soldiers converged on Mount Vernon, Williamsburg and Yorktown, the connections they made to the revolutionary past of these locations strengthened their own resolve.', 'The association between the American Revolution and the Civil War began even before the first shots were fired on Fort Sumter. Maj. Robert Anderson wrote from Fort Moultrie on November 28, 1860, less than five months before the first shots of the Civil War, “There appears to be a romantic desire urging the South Carolinians to have possession of this work, which was so nobly defended by their ancestors in 1776.” The connection to the American Revolution and the “Spirit of ’76” felt by Civil War soldiers on both sides of the conflict was ancestral. Robert E. Lee was married to the great-granddaughter of Martha Washington, while Winfield Scott, “Old Fuss and Feathers,” was the son of a Revolutionary War captain.', 'I do think that the American Revolution can be viewed as a Civil War. As Alan Taylor’s, American Revolutions, book describes the conflict as “multiple and clashing visions of revolution pursued by the diverse American peoples of the continent.” There are also several instances throughout the Revolutionary period where the colonists and British forces are more unified than they are at odds with each other. In fact the reason why Britain sought to levy taxes on the colonists through the Stamp Act was to pay for British forces lining the Western portion of the colonies to prevent colonists from being attacked by native peoples.', 'The American Revolutionary War, sometimes known as the American War for Independence, was a war fought between Great Britain and the original 13 colonies, from 1775 to 1783.

That insight could change the way we think about the American Revolution. Contemporaries understood it that way—or at least, they did at first. David Ramsay, the first patriot historian of the war, held that the Revolution was “originally a civil war in the estimation of both parties.” Mercy Otis Warren wrote that the fires of civil war were kindled as early as the Boston massacre. But in the narratives of these historians, the moment the United States declared independence was the moment the conflict stopped being a civil war.

Why do motherhens so openly take in other species as if they were their own?,"Mother hens have a strong instinct to take in and care for other species as if they were their own, even if they are not of the same species. This is likely due to their natural ability to adapt their native instincts to different environments and their innate ability to perceive analogies and fit what they find to the fulfillment of their needs and desires[1]. They also form strong emotional bonds with their chicks through their voice and appearance[3] and provide a safe base from which their chicks can explore and learn about the world[4]. Furthermore, mother hens have been observed to show empathy when their chicks are in danger, rushing to their aid and bringing them back to the nest[5], suggesting that mother hens have a strong instinctive drive to protect their chicks.","['Do events like these suggest that the chickens regard me as a chicken like themselves? I don’t really think so, other than perhaps when they are motherless chicks and I am their sole provider and protector, similar to the way children raised by wolves imprint on and behave like wolves.

Eventually I noticed she was returning to me less and less, and for shorter periods. One night she elected to remain in the chicken house with the flock.

As they learn about their mother, an emotional bond grows between them, so that they become inseparable for the first six weeks of the chicks’ lives. After the first day, they also bond with their siblings.', 'After three days, they develop a fear of new things, an instinct that keeps them safe from danger. However, mother hen’s presence makes them feel secure, and she provides a safe base from which they can explore and learn about the world. She positions herself near resources to encourage feeding, drinking, and exploration.', 'It’s been observed that mother hens worry when they think their chicks are in danger. If their chicks get separated from them, the mother will rush to the chicks’ aid and bring them back to the nest. Researchers believe that this shows empathy. While cats can show emotion, I know my cats wouldn’t win any awards for being empathetic.']"
how is red meat carcinogenic to humans?,"The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified red meat as a Group 2A carcinogen, which is described as ‘probably carcinogenic to humans’[1][2]. This is based on limited evidence that eating red meat causes cancer in humans and strong evidence supporting a carcinogenic effect[3]. It is important to note that, while eating red meat increases the risk of cancer, the risk is still much lower than something like smoking cigarettes[5].","['Specifically, with regard to colorectal cancer, they classified processed red meat as a “Group 1” carcinogen (“carcinogenic to humans”). As for regular red meat, it was classified as a “Group 2A” carcinogen (“probably carcinogenic to humans”).', 'The IARC classifies red meat as a Group 2A carcinogen, which is described as ‘probably carcinogenic to humans’.', '“This was based on limited evidence that eating red meat causes cancer in humans and strong evidence supporting a carcinogenic effect,” Dr. Khorana says. “Previous studies also have shown that grilling or smoking meat can create suspected carcinogens.”', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer.

Why can't we remove salt from seawater to solve water shortages?,"Removing salt from seawater to solve water shortages is not a viable solution because it is very costly and requires a lot of energy. The process of removing salt from water is not easy, as it involves strong chemical bonds that are difficult to break. Additionally, desalination can have environmental costs, such as killing small ocean creatures and pumping back the leftover salt into the ocean[4]. It is more economical to target sources of water that contain less salt, such as groundwater[3].","['Among the innovations being touted is water desalination (desal for short), which has received a warm welcome from both government and industry players. The process of removing salt, impurities and other minerals on a massive scale so that the water can quench the thirst of millions and be used in other activities, like farming, largely involves two techniques. The less technical one is the heating of sea or salty water to draw pure vapour, which is then cooled into liquid that is safe for drinking; the more complicated process, dubbed reverse osmosis, uses membranes that push water through filters at a high pressure in order to remove salt and other impurities.', '“Desalination of seawater is one of the most expensive ways to get water,” said Ngai Yin Yip, assistant professor of earth and environmental engineering at Columbia University. “This has just got to do with the fact that getting salt out of water is not an easy thing to do. But we have to have water—there’s just no substitute for water. So it can be costly. But the fact that we cannot survive without water means that it is a necessary cost.”', 'According to Yip, the most economical way to go about doing desalination is to target sources of water that contain less salt, such as groundwater. “The less salt there is, the less work you need to do to take it out,” he said. “So from a purely economic perspective, groundwater would be more economical than seawater.” Desalinating groundwater can be done sustainably in places where it is abundant. But where it is decreasing, drawing up groundwater can lead to land subsidence, or in coastal areas, to saltwater intrusion of the aquifer. If there is no groundwater available, Yip feels reverse osmosis of seawater is the best technology to use.', ""There are environmental costs of desalination, as well. Sea life can get sucked into desalination plants, killing small ocean creatures like baby fish and plankton, upsetting the food chain. Also, there's the problem of what to do with the separated salt, which is left over as a very concentrated brine. Pumping this supersalty water back into the ocean can harm local aquatic life. Reducing these impacts is possible, but it adds to the costs."", 'The problem is that the desalination of water requires a lot of energy. Salt dissolves very easily in water, forming strong chemical bonds, and those bonds are difficult to break. Energy and the technology to desalinate water are both expensive, and this means that desalinating water can be pretty costly.']"
How can simulated flavors (such as fruit) be made without even having real flavoring in it?,"Simulated flavors, such as fruit, can be made without real flavoring by using a combination of chemicals to replicate the desired flavor. Flavor chemists take the individual components of natural food and use the best parts to create the flavor experience[1]. There are hundreds of chemicals known to be flavoring agents which are typically mixed together to create known tastes[2]. Particularly for fruit flavors, many of these chemicals are called esters, such as octyl acetate and isoamyl acetate, which carry the bulk of the taste/smell signal[3]. This can be done through trial and error or through chemical analysis of the real thing to make more realistic flavors[3]. However, it is still difficult to replicate the taste of real fruit using this method[4]. To get a truly natural flavor, look for additional wording such as “flavored with real food” or “all natural flavors” accompanied by the actual flavor ingredient[1][5].","['Even though companies, such as Spindrift, claim “we know what fruit is. We knew that, if we worked at it long enough, we’d figure out how we could skip using any ‘flavors’ and just use real squeezed fruit” they seem to lack the knowledge that everything in our world is made up of chemicals. Those wonderful flavors and aromas we receive from our favorite fruits, plants, and spices are made up of a very complex formula designed by nature. When a flavor chemist creates a natural flavor all they are doing is taking the individual components of the natural food and using the best parts to create incredible experiences for the consumer.', 'There are hundreds of chemicals known to be flavoring agents. It\'s interesting that they are normally mixed to create ""known"" tastes. People make artificial grape, cherry, orange, banana, apple, etc. flavors, but it is very rare to mix up something that no one has ever tasted before. But it can and does happen occasionally — take Juicy Fruit gum as an example!', 'Any natural flavor is normally quite complex, with dozens or hundreds of chemicals interacting to create the taste/smell. But it turns out that many flavors — particularly fruit flavors -- have just one or a few dominant chemical components that carry the bulk of the taste/smell signal. Many of these chemicals are called esters. For example, the ester called Octyl Acetate (CH3COOC8H17) is a fundamental component in orange flavor. The ester called isoamyl acetate (CH3COOC5H11) is a fundamental component of banana flavor. If you add these esters to a product, the product will taste, to some degree, like orange or banana. To make more realistic flavors you add other chemicals in the correct proportions to get closer and closer to the real thing. You can do that by trial and error or by chemical analysis of the real thing.', '“What are ‘natural flavors’? No one really knows. But we do know that scientists have gotten pretty good at simulating the taste of just about everything. By using a combination of chemicals, you can replicate any flavor you like. And you can add it into to carbonated water. But it still doesn’t taste like real fruit.” – Spindrift Website ©2019', 'Keep in mind that more mindful food companies will use real food ingredients to flavor their products. It can be difficult to distinguish the truly natural flavors from the lab-created ‘natural flavors’ we see on the label. To get the real stuff, look for additional wording such as “flavored with real food” or “all natural flavors” accompanied by the actual flavor ingredient.']"
Why do many organisms have two nostrils and what are the perks of having two of them instead of three or just one?,"Many organisms have two nostrils because they allow for periods of asymmetrical airflow and more efficient air conditioning[4]. This is because two noses allow for cycles of rest for the hard working air conditioners[4][5] and periodic obstruction of one nasal passage without compromising ventilation[5], which can help to overcome viral infection. Furthermore, two nostrils can provide better aerodynamics and less resistance to airflow than a single large nostril[4].","['Two eyes, two ears, two nostrils. We need our doubles for stereoscopic vision, stereo sound, and super smelling. Our nostrils are separated by a septum, in effect giving us two noses. Most of the time, one nostril allows less air to pass through than the other, with the nasal flow switching every few hours. The slower airflow is caused by the tissue inside swelling with increased blood flow.', 'Most animals have just one nose, but that is a little deceiving. That one nose is divided into two nostrils that act quite independently. The way the nose has developed, it is really like we have two noses packaged into one structure.', 'Almost every living organism in the animal kingdom share several physical characteristics. Most have one heart, two lungs, two eyes, two ears, two noses, one mouth, etc. Wait — two noses? Yes. Almost all animals have one nose with two nostrils that are basically acting as two separate noses. But, why do we have the features in the numbers that we do?', 'But why do we have two noses? Is it because we are bilaterally symmetrical with two arms, two legs, two of most organs? Could one nostril be more beautiful and function better? Surely a single large nostril placed in the centre of the face could function as effectively as is the case for the mouth where one opening serves us very well. It could take us a little while to appreciate the beauty of a single nostril as opposed to the beauty of our paired and smaller nostrils but I feel this would grow on us, especially us physiologists, as a single large nostril would have better aerodynamics and offer less resistance to airflow than our two smaller nostrils. The nose does present a considerable resistance to airflow- around two thirds of the resistance to airflow of the whole airway from nostril to alveoli. Most of the work of breathing is related to moving air through the nose and this is the price we pay for filtering and conditioning the air we breathe.', 'So, two noses are better than one! Having two noses may have some functional significance. Two noses allow for periods of asymmetrical airflow and therefore allow cycles of rest for the hard working air conditioners. Two noses also allow for periodic obstruction of one nasal passage without compromising ventilation and this may help in overcoming viral infection by raising the nasal temperature.']"
do dogs understand the concept of travelling by car?,"Dogs do not understand the concept of travelling by car, as they find the whole car and travel thing to be very odd[1][4]. It is essential for a dog to be secured and safe during a car trip and it is possible to change their perspective and build positive associations with car rides[2][4]. Dogs are stimulated by the visual cues on car rides, such as birds, pedestrians, and other doggie passengers[3]. If a dog has motion sickness, they should see a veterinarian and there are steps that can be taken to keep them safe and relaxed during trips[4]. Some dogs travel well in the car, but others do not and may become restless, whine, howl, bark, and even vomit, urinate, or pass stools[5].","['What do dogs think about road trips? Have you ever wondered? I, as a hound, can tell you that we find the whole car and travel thing to be very odd. Bailie and I don’t really understand the whole concept.', 'Whether your dog loves car rides or despises them, it is essential for him to be secured and safe during the trip and not interfere with you driving. If your dog isn’t a car trip fan or gets anxiety there are ways of changing his perspective and building positive associations, all it requires is planning and patience.', 'If your dog has ever gone manic at the sight of a squirrel or sounded off the second he spotted the mail truck, you have some idea of how easily she’s stimulated by visual cues. On a car ride there are endless new things to see every minute, from birds, to pedestrians, to other doggie passengers. Unlike the human driving the car, dogs have the luxury of gazing out the window and taking in all the sights throughout the whole trip.', 'If after following the above steps you find that your dog is still very fearful or gets overly anxious about car rides see a veterinarian as it might be caused by motion sickness which can be treated with medication. While some travel anxiety is normal, your dog should not be suffering each time you need to take him somewhere by car. In addition, whether your dog enjoys car rides or not it is essential to remain safe on the road. Dogs should be traveling in a harness or a crate in the backseat of the car as that is where they are the safest. In either cases, make sure your dog is not hot and consider having the window partially rolled down as it will not only keep your dog cool but will also enable him to experience all the smells along the way and that will help in keeping him relaxed and calm during the trip. For small breeds it is best to either ride on your lap (only if they remain still during the ride), in a harness or an elevated seat.', 'Some dogs travel well in the car but others do not. They may salivate, become restless, whine, howl, bark, pace, seek your attention or physical contact (which can be dangerous if you are the driver) and may even vomit, urinate or pass stools. Similarly, plane travel can be extremely stressful for some dogs. You may be able to predict this in advance if you know your dog’s temperament and how it reacts to car travel or being placed in a crate. Even if you expect your dog to handle a plane ride with minimum distress, you cannot be certain how the unfamiliar location, unfamiliar handlers, separation from the owners, pressure and temperature changes, unfamiliar noises, and the presence of other animals may affect your pet. However, what you can predict and control is how your dog reacts to its travel crate.']"
the contribution of eating meat and thusly derived amino acids to the evolution of human intelligence.,"Eating meat is thought to have had a major contribution to the evolution of human intelligence. Meat supplied early humans with essential amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that allowed them to exploit marginal, low-quality plant foods[1]. This provided the necessary energy for the expansion of the brain and for increasing in body size while remaining active and social[1]. Some scientists hypothesize that the increased consumption of animal-sourced food during human evolution selected for “meat-adaptive genes” in order to increase resistance to harmful effects of fat, toxins, and pathogens, and to delay dysfunctions in the brain and heart[3]. Meat-adaptive genes enabled the shift from herbivorous to omnivorous diets[3]. Furthermore, evidence suggests that humans are omnivores, being well equipped to eat substantial portions of animal tissue[4]. Finally, having seen the supportive correlations between meat and therefore nicotinamide intake and lower fertility and markers of health and intelligence and therefore longevity during this modern period, there is a biologically plausible biochemical mechanism which suggests meat intake and population growth have contributed to the evolution of human intelligence[5].","['Milton argues that meat supplied early humans not only with all the essential amino acids, but also with many vitamins, minerals and other nutrients they required, allowing them to exploit marginal, low quality plant foods, like roots - foods that have few nutrients but lots of calories. These calories, or energy, fueled the expansion of the human brain and, in addition, permitted human ancestors to increase in body size while remaining active and social.', 'It was this new meat diet, full of densely-packed nutrients, that provided the catalyst for human evolution, particularly the growth of the brain, said Katharine Milton, an authority on primate diet.', 'Some scientists hypothesize that the increased consumption of animal-sourced food during human evolution selected for “meat-adaptive genes”, in order to increase resistance to harmful effects of fat, toxins, and pathogens, and to delay dysfunctions in the brain and heart, that are associated with consuming increasing. These genes may also enable a major increase in lifespan, which could partly explain the difference in life expectancy between humans and other great apes. Meat-adaptive genes enabled the shift from herbivorous to omnivorous diets. However, this is currently just a hypothesis, and requires further research to be verified.', 'Humans have eaten meat since the dawn of the Homo genus around 2.6 million years ago. This article reviews the myriad of genetic, physiological, morphological, and nutritional adaptations in humans to eating meat. Literature reviews will be conducted on research involving the effects of vitamin B12, fatty acids and amino acids, haem absorption, meat-adaptive genes, and parasite co-evolution. Conversely, arguments that humans are adapted to live a herbivorous lifestyle are explored. Evidence suggests that humans are omnivores, being well equipped to eat substantial portions of animal tissue.', 'Having seen these supportive correlations between meat and therefore nicotinamide intake and lower fertility and markers of health and intelligence and therefore longevity during this modern period for which there are data, we now return to our 100 000–200 000 years of evolution and history with meat intake and population growth in mind and then will propose a biologically plausible biochemical mechanism.']"
"When growing vegetables, such as cucumbers, does the quality of water have any meaningful impact on the vegetable (i.e. Filtered water, tap water, etc. )","Yes, the quality of water does have a meaningful impact on the vegetable when growing vegetables such as cucumbers. Water quality can impact your plants in a variety of ways, and this is especially important when it comes to growing fruits and vegetables as they are going to be consumed[1]. The amount of water needed varies depending on the type of vegetable, with vegetables that flower and produce fruit needing more water than leafy greens[2]. Poor quality water can cause nutritional imbalance within the plant and may also lead to increased foodborne illnesses from microbes, parasites, and viruses[3]. Watering vegetables consistently and deeply is also important for their health and productivity[3][4]. From tap water to bottled water, it is best to use clean water that is free from contaminants to ensure the healthiest plants[1][3].","['Whether it’s talking to your plants or adding nutrient-rich fertilizer, there are a multitude of ways people help their plants grow. A great way to ensure healthy plants is to use the right water to nourish them. Water quality can impact your plants in a variety of ways, and this is even more important when it comes to growing fruits and vegetables. The things you grow in your vegetable garden presumably make it into your body. This not only means that clean water impacts your plants’ health, but it can have an effect on your health, as well.', '- Plant type – The amount of water also varies depending on what you’re growing. Vegetables that need a lot of water are the ones that flower and produce fruit (e.g.: squash, tomatoes, beans, cucumbers, etc). Whereas leafy greens (e.g.: lettuce, spinach, herbs, kale, chard, etc) don’t need as much.', 'Just as food nourishes our bodies, water serves as the lifeblood for plants. Plants absorb water through their roots that subsequently moves through their vascular system. As water disperses across a plant’s leaves, stems, buds, flowers, and fruit, it carries with it a variety of crucial nutrients–functioning similarly to the human circulatory system. However, just like water carries the vital elements throughout a plant, it also may carry contaminants. These contaminants range from biological (microbes) to chemical (heavy metals). While contamination is less of a concern for ornamental plants, fruits and vegetables given poor quality water can directly impact your health. Increasing evidence not only suggests that contaminated water causes nutritional imbalance within the plant, it also indicates a link to increased foodborne illnesses from microbes, parasites, and viruses, in humans. The concern is greatest in leafy vegetables that tend to be eaten without cooking.', 'Watering vegetables consistently is extremely important. If your garden isn’t doing very well, then you might be watering it wrong. Just remember to water deeply weekly, and you’ll notice a big difference in both the health and productivity of your veggies!', 'From tap water to bottled water, there can be a lot of confusion surrounding the best water for growing fruits and vegetables. We’re here to here to clarify what water leads to the healthiest plants–and in turn, the healthiest you.']"
Does dreaming take energy?,"Yes, dreaming does take energy. According to the references, dreaming is a psyche mechanism used to discharge pending emotional energy[5]. This pending emotional energy is what motivates the dream and its purpose is to spend and discharge emotional energy that exists inside us[2][3][5]. Furthermore, dreaming is an effective way to expend any energy residues and rid us of the energy tensions that pile up daily[5].","['Consciousness goes deeper and deeper into sleep, till its energy goes down below the emotional energy of thymikon. This is the time dreaming starts, with the sudden flow of energy from the charged thymikon to sleeping consciousness. Energy always flows from a charged body to some less charged one. This energized the idol of the leopard in my memory, which acquired a higher energy level, enough for my consciousness to see him. This internal fact roused my consciousness up in a strange way. It did not wake totally up to see other perceptions neither from memory nor from the surrounding. I woke enough to see just the leopard, the suddenly excited idol of memory.', ""That is, the dream is not interested in what will happen in a day or in a week or in two months from now, or in what happened a month ago. The dream does not concern what happened in the past or what will happen in the future or any fantastic and irrelevant material. It concerns what will happen right here, right now, with the real emotional energy pending annoyingly in the psyche. As I say in my first book, this pending energy is the true charge motivating the dream, and spending it is the ultimate purpose of all dreams. Indeed, energy administration is a very important and crucial deed, and that's exactly what our performing psyche is doing especially in dreaming."", 'So, we can suppose with no logical discomfort that this dream had happened precisely for me to react dynamically in order to discharge this emotional energy trapped inside me from the day before. This discharge of emotional energy is the only thing that happens for real in an overall faked dream. I will say it one more time: the dream happens in order to spend and discharge some emotional energy that exists inside us at the moment such dreams begin, so that a general balance will come, which will bring an eventual serenity. After all it is well known to all of us, that usually we all wake up serene the next morning.', 'I have shown so far that the dream is an evolved psyche mechanism of automatic discharging pending emotional (energy) charges.', 'An important difference between these two levels (organic and psychic) is that there is no mechanism to expend and automatically get rid of the bodily residues (fat). On the psychic level however there is a very effective such mechanism that expends any energy residues – the dream. The dream may be useful in many ways to the functioning of our organism, but one of its functions, if not its main purpose, is to rid us of the energy tensions that pile up daily from the difficult interactions between our psyche and our surroundings. This happens very often, every time we go to sleep and dream, whether we remember our dreams or not. Every time we go to sleep, some weaker or stronger emotional charges are pending inside us, disconnected from our minds and consciousness which has been unable to discharge these, a deed made possible by the dream.']"
What biological function does grief serve? It doesn't seem necessary for survival yet is a firm part of the human (and animal) condition.,"According to research, grief may serve a biological purpose. It has been suggested that grief is the flip side of very close emotional attachment, and may be a necessary process to help the body mourn and repair after a loss[1][3]. Grief may also have a physical effect on the body, as it can cause a release of certain hormones that can affect the cardiovascular system and the cells of the immune system[2]. Animal studies can provide new conceptual models for approaching an understanding of human bereavement, and may allow for a deeper understanding of how grief may affect the body[5]. However, it is important to note that understanding the mechanics of grief does not make it any less painful[4].","['One way to determine if grief has a biological purpose is to see if animals do the same. Barbara J. King, an anthropologist at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, suggests that there may be an evolutionary basis for grief — at least in animals. “It seems to me that grief is the flip side of very close emotional attachment,” she said.', 'Put the studies together and on the whole, Dr. Fagundes said, “everything starts with the brain.” It responds to the death (and to intense stress in general), by releasing certain hormones that fan out into the body, affecting the cardiovascular system and the cells of the immune system. Aside from that generality, however, the biology of grief has no clear chain of cause-and-effect that the biology of, say, diabetes, has. That’s because the goals of these studies are to better understand the griever’s risks for disease, not to understand the path of grief through the body.', 'King believes that animals could be compassionate and empathetic, and hypothesizes that the reasons animals show signs of grieving is because it’s a necessary process. “One of the suggestions is that grief is the time the body takes to mourn and repair [after a loss].” When two animals have a companionship, they grow accustomed to one another’s presence, and may even rely on each other for activities such as feeding or playing. After one passes away, the other may have to relearn certain routines, and adjust to life by itself.', 'Nesse, though, firmly believes that there isn’t one purpose for any emotion. “Emotions have many functions,” he said. “What we should be trying to do is understand in what situation an emotion is useful.” He nonetheless thinks “the idea that grief may be a useful biological trait that is shaped by natural selection seems both preposterous and somewhat cold-blooded,” which he wrote in a book discussing how grief affects older couples. He points out that understanding the mechanics of grief doesn’t make it any less painful.', 'Most important, animal studies provide new conceptual models for approaching an understanding of human bereavement. Examples are given in the section on social relationships as biological regulators and in Chapter 7. In an additional example, a single aspect of grief can be isolated and studied in terms of its biological substrate, as in the work of Weiss 83,84 on learned helplessness. The helplessness of human grief is surely different from the state induced in rats by inescapable shock. Yet an understanding of the simpler case should provide clues about what to measure and how to begin to study the much more complex interrelationship of affects and biological changes that occur in human grief.']"
How come america does not have any foreign bases within its countries borders,"The United States does not have any foreign bases within its countries borders because there is no need for other countries to establish bases on American soil. The United States already has around 800 bases in foreign countries, spread across 80 countries, and is considered to be the dominant world power[2][4]. Furthermore, the creation and maintenance of so many US bases overseas encourages other nations to build their own foreign bases in what could rapidly become an escalating “base race”[3]. This could lead to increased regional tensions and the risk of future military confrontation[3]. As a result, the idea that there would be foreign bases on US soil is unthinkable[4].","['The United States isn’t, however, the only country to control military bases outside its territory. Great Britain still has about seven bases and France five in former colonies. Russia has around eight in former Soviet republics. For the first time since World War II, Japan’s “Self-Defense Forces” have a foreign base in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa, alongside US and French bases there. South Korea, India, Chile, Turkey, and Israel each reportedly have at least one foreign base. There are also reports that China may be seeking its first base overseas. In total, these countries probably have about 30 installations abroad, meaning that the United States has approximately 95% of the world’s foreign bases.', 'Despite our unorthodox presidential election, America’s overseas military bases are largely taken for granted in today’s foreign policy debates. The U.S. maintains a veritable empire of military bases throughout the world—about 800 of them in more than 70 countries. Many view our bases as a symbol of our status as the dominant world power. But America’s forward-deployed military posture incurs substantial costs and disadvantages, exposing the U.S. to vulnerabilities and unintended consequences.', 'The creation and maintenance of so many US bases overseas likewise encourages other nations to build their own foreign bases in what could rapidly become an escalating “base race.” Bases near the borders of China and Russia, in particular, threaten to fuel new cold wars. US officials may insist that building yet more bases in East Asia is a defensive act meant to ensure peace in the Pacific, but tell that to the Chinese. That country’s leaders are undoubtedly not “reassured” by the creation of yet more bases encircling their borders. Contrary to the claim that such installations increase global security, they tend to ratchet up regional tensions, increasing the risk of future military confrontation.', 'To the extent that Americans think about these bases at all, we generally assume they’re essential to national security and global peace. Our leaders have claimed as much since most of them were established during World War II and the early days of the Cold War. As a result, we consider the situation normal and accept that US military installations exist in staggering numbers in other countries, on other peoples’ land. On the other hand, the idea that there would be foreign bases on US soil is unthinkable.', 'While there are no freestanding foreign bases permanently located in the United States, there are now around 800 US bases in foreign countries. Seventy years after World War II and 62 years after the Korean War, there are still 174 US “base sites” in Germany, 113 in Japan, and 83 in South Korea, according to the Pentagon. Hundreds more dot the planet in around 80 countries, including Aruba and Australia, Bahrain and Bulgaria, Colombia, Kenya, and Qatar, among many other places. Although few Americans realize it, the United States likely has more bases in foreign lands than any other people, nation, or empire in history.']"
Why do animals enjoy being petted?,"Animals enjoy being petted because it helps establish a strong connection and trust between them and the human[1], and it creates a feeling of closeness and relaxation[2].

Domestic animals are usually accustomed to being petted, but wild animals may not enjoy it as much due to their fear and anxiety[5].","['There are numerous reasons why animals enjoy being petted, one of which is that it helps establish a strong connection and trust between the human and the petted animal.', 'Now that you know why animals enjoy being petted, you may wonder why humans enjoy petting animals. Humans, in general, enjoy touching and being touched. Touching and petting an animal creates a feeling of closeness and relaxation. Feeling your dog press his nose into your hand for more pets or hearing your cat’s purr of satisfaction further boosts enjoyment.', 'Many types of animals love being petted. While pets like birds may enjoy having their feathers stroked, mammals are the ones that most seem to enjoy being on the receiving end of pats, pets, and snuggles. There is a scientific answer for why pets enjoy being stroked, but there is probably more than one reason why your dog, cat, hamster, or other pet enjoys pets.', 'Petting does not only not stimulate a neuron in an animal, but it also does in people too. The pleasurable sensation that animals get from touching is one of the reasons they enjoy it. The sensation is associated with their hair follicles, which explains why they find it so appealing.', 'While it may seem like wild mammals should enjoy being petted just as much as domestic ones, that isn’t the case. Wild animals are not accustomed to human touch, so would not feel the same pleasure that domesticated pets do. Their fear and anxiety would prevent them from relaxing to enjoy the touch.']"
Which cultures were involved in global trade before globalisation and which weren't?,"Before globalisation, cultures that were involved in global trade included European countries and their colonies in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa[3], and Western Europe with Asia, the Americas, Africa and Oceania[5]. Cultures that weren't involved in global trade included developing countries that weren't open to free trade, and those with limited access to international markets[4].","[""Globalization's advocates say that free trade and free markets don't dilute or pollute other cultures, they enhance them. Trade creates wealth, they say. Wealth frees the world's poorest people from the daily struggle for survival, and allows them to embrace, celebrate and share the art, music, crafts and literature that might otherwise have been sacrificed to poverty. So who's right? Is globalization killing non-western cultures, or is it augmenting and enhancing them?"", ""Opponents of globalization argue that the playing field isn't level. Free trade naturally favors larger economies, they say, and so the predominant western influence stifles the cultures and traditions of the developing world. Free traders argue that globalization enhances culture, and that, in any event, culture can't thrive in poverty. Both sides generally agree that subsidies, tariffs and other protectionist policies by developed countries against goods commonly produced in the third world (textiles, for example) hamper both culture and economic growth there."", 'Nearly all economists and scholars of globalisation like to point to the fact that the economy was rather globalised by the early 20th century. As European countries colonised Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, they turned their colonies into suppliers of raw materials for European manufacturers, as well as markets for European goods. Meanwhile, the economies of the colonisers were also becoming free-trade zones for each other. “The opening years of the 20th century were the closest thing the world had ever seen to a free world market for goods, capital and labour,” writes the Harvard professor of government Jeffry Frieden in his standard account, Global Capitalism: Its Fall and Rise in the 20th Century. “It would be a hundred years before the world returned to that level of globalisation.”', 'Globalization\'s advocates argue that wealth invigorates culture, and that trade and access to international markets are the best way to create wealth.

In his book In Defence of Global Capitalism, Swedish author Johan Norberg argues that because of emerging technology, developing countries that quickly embrace borderless trade can make the leap to western world living standards in a fraction of the time it once took. ""Development which took Sweden 80 years to accomplish,"" Norberg writes, ""has been successfully reiterated by Taiwan in 25."" As an example, Norberg cites an anecdote from the World Bank:', 'After the Second World War trade within Europe rebounded, and from the 1990s onwards exceeded the highest levels of the first wave of globalization. In addition Western Europe then started to increasingly trade with Asia, the Americas, and to a smaller extent Africa and Oceania.']"
"Why are plants and insects more deadly in hotter, more tropical climates?","Plants and insects are more deadly in hotter, more tropical climates due to the narrower seasonal variance, which means any significant rises in temperature or changes in rainfall could be devastating[1]. Also, warmer temperatures are more conducive to pest populations growing more quickly[2]. Furthermore, hotter climates can lead to an array of insect pests and pathogens attacking crops, with yields of wheat, rice, and corn potentially increasing by 25% per degree Celsius of warming[4]. Additionally, extreme weather such as flooding, drought, heat waves, and fires can also cause major damage to insect populations[5].","['“Tropical insects have evolved under climates with narrower seasonal variance,” explains Carol Boggs, a paper co-author and entomologist at the University of South Carolina. As a result, most tropical insects are simply not evolved for extreme climate swings, meaning any significant rises in temperature or changes in rainfall could be devastating.', 'This would explain why many pests are moving away from the tropics towards more temperate areas. Pests like warmer temperatures – but up to a point. If it is too hot or too cold, populations grow more slowly. Since temperate regions are not currently at the optimal temperature for pests, populations are expected to grow more quickly in these areas as they warm up.', 'At the same time, scientists noticed that people who lived in these tropical areas tended to have lower incomes. This meant that a person living in an area with a warmer climate was likely to make less money than someone living in a cooler climate. Scientists thought there might be a connection between living in a place with more disease-spreading bugs and having a lower income.', 'A hotter world is likely to bring an array of insect pests and pathogens to attack potatoes, soya beans, wheat, and other crops. A group of American researchers calculated that yields of the three most important grain crops – wheat, rice, and corn – lost to insects will increase by as much as 25% per degree Celsius of warming, with countries in temperate areas hit the hardest. Crop pests also tend to thrive in simplified environments that have been stripped of their predators – another legacy of monocultural farming practices.', 'But that’s not all: Insects are also facing more and worsening extreme weather, just as we are. Flooding, drought, long-term heat waves and fires can wipe out whole generations of insects or destroy the resources they depend on.']"
Why does everyone hate Monsanto?,"People hate Monsanto for multiple reasons.

why do we have empathy for animals and not insects?,"Humans tend to feel more empathy and compassion towards animals that are more closely related to them, such as mammals[1]. Scientific research has also backed the idea of emotions in animals, such as empathy, grief, fear, and other complex emotions[2][3]. Empathy is likely more prevalent in social species, or animals that associate in social groups[4], and it is possible that they care about members of their own species in a way that humans can relate to[3]. The ability to empathize with animals is a quality that helps humans along as a social species. In comparison, humans typically do not feel the same level of empathy and compassion towards insects due to the fact that they are not as closely related to humans, and they are not social species, therefore not exhibiting the same emotional traits.","['Of course, many of us feel we have a deep bond with our pets or with a specific type of creature such as the birds or even squirrels in our yards. Or we may feel compassion towards the animals in a zoo. In fact, evolutionary biologists have studied the general sense of empathy humans have towards animals and our tendency to anthropomorphize them. The majority of us can muster both empathy (the feeling that we can understand the emotions of something outside ourselves) as well as compassion (being moved to help another) for mammals and the other creatures we are more closely related to. We can even have these feelings for trees and bugs, but often to a lesser extent.', 'Many humans feel love and empathy towards animals, but do the animals we care about so deeply feel the same about us? How about each other? Scientific research backs the idea of emotions in animals. In fact, researchers have observed empathy in them, as well as grief, fear and other complex emotions often associated primarily with humans.', 'The idea of empathy in animals introduces a whole new way of looking at our non-human neighbors, suggesting that our feelings toward them might be reciprocated. It is also possible that they truly care about members of their own species in a way that we can relate to. This complex emotional trait has been observed in other primates, as well as dogs, mice and elephants.', 'Empathy is likely more prevalent in social species, or animals that associate in social groups.

Harris at Johns Hopkins University described it as “an evolutionary mechanism to maintain social cohesion.” In other words, animals that rely on a group for survival must be more sensitive to what those around them are feeling, whether they’re human or non-humans.', 'Why do people spend so much time and emotion attempting to apply their own moral sense to an animal’s actions?

"If the life of a racing dog is so bad that greyhounds need rescuing, why is it still legal?","Greyhound racing is still legal because anti-cruelty statutes are based on the concept of nonhuman animals as property and embody a moral framework that does not include nonhuman animals[1][2].

The process of domesticating animals and why some take to it more than others?,"The process of domestication is a particular process that’s done through selective breeding, where the animals must be raised and cared for by humans[2].

What societal conditions allowed for Philosophers to be so prominent and influential in Ancient Greece and Rome?,"Ancient Greek and Roman societies were conducive to the rise of philosophers due to their preference for reason and willingness to challenge traditional ways of living, believing, and thinking[3]. Additionally, philosophers of Ancient Greece and Rome sought to define a new space of doing as philosophizing, independent of ordinary political action[4]. This led to the development of political philosophy, which has had a lasting impact on Western culture as noted by Alfred North Whitehead.","['This article therefore begins by surveying political practices and the reflective accounts to which they gave rise in the classical Greek period of the independent polis. It then turns to the thinkers who invented “political philosophy” par excellence: Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. It continues to Hellenistic Greek thinkers before considering the main currents and roles of political philosophy in the Roman republic. While offering a survey of certain developments in the Roman empire, it leaves aside the distinctive contributions made by Jewish and Christian thinkers in that period, and in particular the great upheaval of thought effected by Augustine, who was deeply engaged with classical authors such as Plato and Cicero, but who is one starting point for medieval political philosophy. The article concludes with some reflections on how the nature of “ancient political philosophy” should, and should not, be understood.', 'Ancient Greek philosophy arose in the 6th century BC, marking the end of the Greek Dark Ages. Greek philosophy continued throughout the Hellenistic period and the period in which Greece and most Greek-inhabited lands were part of the Roman Empire. Philosophy was used to make sense of the world using reason. It dealt with a wide variety of subjects, including astronomy, epistemology, mathematics, political philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, ontology, logic, biology, rhetoric and aesthetics.', 'With this preference for reason came a critique of traditional ways of living, believing, and thinking, which sometimes caused political trouble for the philosophers themselves. Xenophanes directly challenged the traditional anthropomorphic depiction of the gods, and Socrates was put to death for allegedly inventing new gods and not believing in the gods mandated by the city of Athens. After the fall of Alexander the Great, and because of Aristotle’s ties with Alexander and his court, Aristotle escaped the same fate as Socrates by fleeing Athens. Epicurus, like Xenophanes, claimed that the mass of people is impious, since the people conceive of the gods as little more than superhumans, even though human characteristics cannot appropriately be ascribed to the gods. In short, not only did ancient Greek philosophy pave the way for the Western intellectual tradition, including modern science, but it also shook cultural foundations in its own time.', 'This distinctive Greek—and particularly Platonic – outlook must condition any historical understanding of the development of ancient political philosophy. While one influential approach to the history of political thought takes its bearings from what a thinker was trying to do in and by what he or she said or wrote, it is important to recognize that the founders of ancient political philosophy were in part trying to define a new space of doing as philosophizing, independent of ordinary political action. This is not to say that they did not also have ordinary political intentions, but rather to stress that the invention of political philosophy was also intended as a mode of reflection upon the value of ordinary political life.', 'Greek philosophy has influenced much of Western culture since its inception. Alfred North Whitehead once noted: ""The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato"". Clear, unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophers to Roman philosophy, Early Islamic philosophy, Medieval Scholasticism, the European Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment.']"
How is the soil replenished in farming fields.,"Soil can be replenished in farming fields through soil restoration, regenerative grazing, adding compost, manure, crop residues, or green manure, and reducing the use of agricultural chemicals and tillage[3]. In addition, soil regeneration, as a form of ecological regeneration, can create new soil and improve soil health by minimizing topsoil loss, retaining carbon, increasing biodiversity, and maintaining proper water and nutrient cycling[5].","['Soil restoration is the process of improving the structure, microbial life, nutrient density, and overall carbon levels of soil. Many human endeavors — conventional farming chief among them — have depleted the Earth to the extent that nutrient levels in almost every kind of food have fallen by between 10 and 100 percent in the past 70 years. Soil quality can improve dramatically, though, when farmers and gardeners maintain constant ground cover, increase microbe populations, encourage biological diversity, reduce the use of agricultural chemicals, and avoid tillage.', 'Regenerative grazing can be extremely effective in restoring soil carbon levels deep underground. The deeper the carbon, the more it is protected from oxidative and microbial decomposition. The sequestration of most significance is that which occurs below 30 cm (12).', 'OM is always in the process of decomposing, until it becomes humus. OM levels are reduced through cropping and can be replenished by adding compost or manure, or crop residues, or green manure (crops such as buckwheat, clover or ryegrass that are grown as cover crops and then tilled into the soil). Soil OM can be conserved with reduced tillage practices, such as no-till. OM improves water retention, making it a good addition to sandy soil. OM is also added to clay or silt soils to increase aggregation and thereby improve drainage. OM provides nutrients as it decomposes, buffers the pH of the soil solution (see below) against rapid chemical changes, and improves soils’ cation exchange capacity (see below).', 'In the haste to shift to large-scale agriculture, the natural nutrient cycles and processes on our planet can be overlooked. Rather than multi-crop and no-till farming, thousands of acres of land are now used to plant one crop, tilled annually. Monocropping and overturning soil at large scales depletes the natural balance of soil in around seven years. Plants need nitrogen, which they normally receive through natural soil cycles, for growth. In response, most farms use synthetic nitrogen fertilizers.', 'Soil regeneration, as a particular form of ecological regeneration within the field of restoration ecology, is creating new soil and rejuvenating soil health by: minimizing the loss of topsoil, retaining more carbon than is depleted, boosting biodiversity, and maintaining proper water and nutrient cycling. This has many benefits, such as: soil sequestration of carbon in response to a growing threat of climate change, a reduced risk of soil erosion, and increased overall soil resilience.']"

Why does everything in the supermarket have an expiration date?,"The expiration date, or sell-by date, on products in the supermarket is an estimate of when the product will taste best and when the company wants customers to eat and enjoy the product[1]. It is not necessarily a guarantee that the product will be bad after the expiration date[1][3][5], and it is also used as a way to maintain uniformity and aesthetic standards[3]. Additionally, having expired products in the supermarket is not very inspirational and is a risk retailers are not willing to take[5].","['The sell-by date, often referred to as the expiration date, is the company’s estimate of when a food item will taste best, its optimal date. “You want people to eat and enjoy the product when it’s at its peak, because that’s going to increase their enjoyment, [and] encourage them to buy it again,” he said.', 'Apparently, very wrong. Researchers have found that “expiration” dates — which rarely correspond to food actually expiring or spoiling — are mostly well-intentioned, but haphazard and confusing. Put another way, they’re not expiration dates at all. And the broader public’s misunderstanding about them is a major contributor in every single one of the factors I named above: wasted food, wasted revenue, wasted household income, and food insecurity.', 'But that mindset naturally, even inevitably, leads to waste. In many places, if you can’t sell all your milk by the sell-by date, you have to dump it. Consumers don’t want to buy a box of Cheez-Its that only has a week left on it. Beef that “expires” in two days is not going to fly off the shelves. And if you can’t sell all your carrots, some of those carrots are going to start getting a little bendy. And many grocery stores will only sell produce that’s up to a certain aesthetic standard — no weird-looking apples or sweet potatoes from outer space, everything the same shape and size. Furthermore, if a manufacturer changes the label on their cookie packages, all the old packages will probably just be discarded to maintain uniformity.', '""Expires on"": Theoretically, this date refers to when a food is no longer okay to eat, but there\'s no guarantee. “In practice, it just varies,” Gunders says.', ""Buying groceries is about so much more than mere sustenance. It's about getting inspired. Finding an expired product isn't very inspirational. And while some consumers are completely fine with eating food that's past its expiry date, like this guy, most retailers aren't willing to take the chance that consumers will be fine after. Safety always comes first, and when customer stories spread like wildfire, having expired products hanging around is a risk retailers can't afford to take.""]"
what exactly did Ceasar do to earn the hate of Senate moderates?,"Caesar earned the hate of Senate moderates by proposing legislation to clamp down on electoral bribery, which was unpopular among the people and defeated[2]. He also violated 'international law' by attacking during a truce and killing 430 thousand Germans, which Cato alone expressed anger against[2]. Caesar also secured the passage of an agrarian law through the use of violence against Bibulus, which further contributed to his unpopularity[5].","[""That year also proved that Cato's push for stronger anti-bribery legislation both been a failure and was deeply needed. As interest rates doubled as candidates borrowed to finance bribes, a deal was struck between the two conservative sitting consuls, a triumviral supporter, and a triumviral opponent to pool resources to bribe voters and support the sitting consuls' assignment to desirable provinces. When one of the participants disclosed the plot to the senate, all were charged with electoral corruption, with the largest loss falling on the consul Domitius (Cato's brother-in-law). In response to the scandal, the senate delayed elections for an inquiry, but tribunes started to bring vetoes against various electoral proposals."", 'Cato also brought legislation to clamp down on electoral bribery by requiring that all candidates submit detailed financial records.

Similarly unpopular was Cato\'s reaction to Caesar\'s victories over the Gauls and Germans: on receipt of reports that Caesar had attacked during a truce but won a victory in which he killed some 430 thousand Germans, ""Cato alone expressed anger at the victory[;] he considered Caesar\'s actions to be a gross violation of \'international law\'...

Pompey and Crassus were to be elected consuls for the ensuing year, and Caesar was to have money voted him, besides another five years in his provincial command. 7 This seemed very strange to men of understanding. For those who were getting so much money from Caesar urged the senate to give him money as if he had none, nay rather, they forced it to do so, though it groaned over its own decrees. 8 Cato, indeed, was not there, for he had purposely been sent out of the way on a  p497 mission to Cyprus,\u200b41 and Favonius, who was an ardent follower of Cato, finding himself unable to accomplish anything by his opposition, bounded out of doors and clamoured to the populace. 9 But no one gave heed to him, for some were in awe of Pompey and Crassus, and most wanted to please Caesar, lived in hopes of his favours, and so kept quiet.', ""At the debate that year about the lex Trebonia to grant Crassus the province of Syria so he could fight a war of choice against the Parthian Empire, Cato again repeated his tactic of filibustering until his opponents had him arrested so he could claim to be poorly treated. To avoid the a repeat of this embarrassment, at later debates, his attendance was barred by armed mobs. He tried similar obstructive tactics against the lex Licinia Pompeia to extend Caesar's command, but again failed. At this time, Plutarch reports – if not an injection of imaginative foreshadowing – that Cato moved to split Pompey from Caesar rather than opposing the united triumvirate. At the end of the year, Pompey was to assume his command in Spain but decided against tradition to stay near Rome and govern entirely through his legates."", 'Throughout the consulship, Cato and his allies also produced a substantive amount of propaganda meant to discredit Caesar and his triumviral allies by branding them tyrants, a message reinforced by the violence visited upon Bibulus to secure passage of the agrarian law; the campaign was successful in making it difficult for the three allies to use mob tactics out of fear that they might validate the opposition\'s rumours.

How is Bacon made?,"Bacon is traditionally made by rubbing cuts of pork loin or belly with a mixture of salt and spices and leaving the meat for a week, before it is washed with warm water, dried and smoked[1].

Nevertheless, there are factors in each step that require consistency to obtain a high-quality product. Good Manufacturing practices are essential as well.', 'But mass-produced bacon is made in a different way – cured by injections of salty water, which can also include chemicals such as potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate and ascorbic acid. “The main reason that’s done is to actually increase the weight, so when you’re buying bacon in the supermarket you’re actually buying expensive water,” says Charlie Pyper, the founder of Cure & Simple, a premium bacon supplier.', 'Most of the bacon you eat nowadays is wet-cured, since this quicker method is far more suitable to industrial mass-production. To begin with, a number of curing ingredients — including salt, sugar, sodium nitrate, and other chemicals (more on that later) are mixed together to create a brine. The raw bacon is then injected with this brine (although sometimes it is soaked in it instead; a method known as immersion curing).

He has recently compared the for-profit college sector to the subprime mortgage banking industry—arguing that both grew rapidly based on lending to low-income people with little ability to repay the loans.” For-profit schools make up nearly half of all student defaults. For-profit schools claim to give students who have been turned away from other institutions the opportunity of a higher education, but the reality is that the wider net they have cast primarily includes lower-income individuals who do not have the propensity to be able to pay back these loans, therefore creating an effective “house of cards” and a predicted “student loan bubble.”']"
When did the idea of a sugary breakfast come about?,"The idea of a sugary breakfast came about in the early 20th century. In 1939, Ranger Joe was the first pre-sweetened breakfast cereal of sugar-coated puffed wheat or rice to be introduced in the US[2]. Then, in 1953, Kellogg's Sugar Smacks was created with 56% sugar by weight[2]. In the 1950s, the big breakfast cereal companies started to target children by refining the flour to remove fiber and adding sugar to improve the flavor[2]. Tony the Tiger was also introduced as a mascot to directly target children with sugary Frosted Flakes[2][5]. Therefore, the idea of a sugary breakfast became popular in the 1950s.[1]","['An American invention, breakfast cereal began as a digestive aid, acquired religious overtones, became a sugary snack and now toggles between health food and sweet indulgence. Throughout that history, it has mirrored changes in the world beyond the breakfast table. Here are some highlights.', ""After World War II, the big breakfast cereal companies—now including General Mills, who entered the market in 1924 with Wheaties—increasingly started to target children. The flour was refined to remove fiber, which at the time was considered to undermine digestion and absorption of nutrients, and sugar was added to improve the flavor for children. The new breakfast cereals began to look starkly different from their ancestors. Ranger Joe, the first pre-sweetened breakfast cereal of sugar-coated puffed wheat or rice, was introduced in the US in 1939. Kellogg's Sugar Smacks, created in 1953, had 56% sugar by weight. Different mascots were introduced, such as the Rice Krispies elves and later pop icons like Tony the Tiger and the Trix Rabbit."", 'Here were the roots of the current obesity epidemic—the culinary traditions of active lifestyles, imported to sedentary ones—and they led to another round of debates about what breakfast was and should be. Fighting against his era’s preference for heavy breakfasts, Pierre Blot, the French cookbook author and professor of gastronomy, stipulated that breakfast that be, ideally, as small as possible. He also argued that it should, when consumed at all, consist of meats (cold, leftover from the supper the night before) rather than cakes or sweets, which rotted the teeth. (Blot further advised against taking tea with breakfast—water, coffee, milk, and even cocoa were preferable—and prohibited liquor.)', 'The origin story of the breakfast behemoth, is actually a very adult one. The first cold cereal was introduced in 1863, when a religious conservative vegetarian and health spa (then called a “sanitarium”) proprietor named James Caleb Jackson created what he called “granula” made out of graham flour. The cereal was so hard it needed to be soaked overnight. John Harvey Kellogg, another religious vegetarian (specifically, a Seventh Day Adventist) and sanitarium owner, similarly introduced his own version of “granula,” which he named “granola” when Jackson threatened to sue. Unfortunately for Jackson, who’s been lost to mainstream history, it was granola — and Kellogg — that stuck.', 'It was around this time that Tony the Tiger would emerge as a mascot that directly targeted children with sugary Frosted Flakes. With Tony, this new form of youth advertising, which would compel children to request that their mothers buy them specific brands of sweet cereal, would catapult cereal into millions of American pantries. Breakfast cereal, which had originally been developed as a nutritious food that people ate at health spas, was transformed into the almost dessert-like product most of us think of today.']"
"Why is milk said to be a good source of protein when it contains only about 3,5 %?","Milk is a good source of protein because it contains all of the essential amino acids in sufficient amounts to qualify milk as a good source of protein[2][5].

Do animals that live in extreme temperatures (hot/cold) actually want to be there?,"Not all animals that live in extreme temperatures (hot/cold) want to be there. Cold-blooded animals, such as insects, worms, fish, amphibians, and reptiles, do not generate internal heat and depend on external environments to warm them up to a level where their body and enzymes function sufficiently[3]. Mammals and birds, on the other hand, are warm-blooded animals, and need to generate their own heat to remain active and maintain similar internal body temperatures[2]. They are known as endotherms (endo-inside + therm-heat) as they generate their heat internally, while many other animals are ectotherms (ecto-outside) and generate so little heat internally they are dependent on the external environment to warm them up[2][3]. A large ectothermic Arctic or Antarctic land animal would never get enough energy regularly enough from the surroundings to become sufficiently active once it had cooled, so all polar land animals of any size need to be warm-blooded to be active[5].","['Animals that cannot generate internal heat are known as poikilotherms (poy-KIL-ah-therms), or cold-blooded animals. Insects, worms, fish, amphibians, and reptiles fall into this category—all creatures except mammals and birds. The term cold-blooded is a little misleading because poikilotherms can have very warm body temperatures in the tropics. Cold-blooded actually means the animal’s body temperature is basically the same as its surroundings. A fish swimming in 40° F water will have a body temperature very near 40° F. The same fish in 60° F water will have a body temperature near 60° F.', ""Arctic and Antarctic birds and mammals such as penguins, whales, bears, foxes and seals - are warm blooded animals and they maintain similar internal body temperatures to warm blooded animals in any other climate zone - that is 35-42°C (95-107°F) depending on the species. They have to keep high body temperatures to remain active. These animals are known as endotherms (endo-inside + therm-heat) as they generate their heat internally. The polar regions' cold and wind mean that this heat can very quickly be lost leading to hypothermia (hypo-under)."", 'Many (non polar) animals are ectotherms (ecto-outside) , which means that they generate so little heat internally they are dependent on the external environment to warm them up to a level where their body and enzymes function sufficiently well enough for an active and functional life. Typically they raise their temperature by basking in the sun until they are warm enough to become active. Reptiles and amphibians do this while invertebrates such as insects and spiders are usually small enough to be able to warm up quickly to the ambient temperature from the air alone without basking in direct sunlight.', 'Cold-blooded animals do not maintain a constant body temperature. They get their heat from the outside environment, so their body temperature fluctuates, based on external temperatures. If it is 50 °F outside, their body temperature will eventually drop to 50 °F, as well. If it rises to 100 °F, their body temperature will reach 100 °F. Most of the rest of the animal kingdom—except birds and mammals—are cold-blooded.', 'A large ectothermic Arctic or Antarctic land animal would never get enough energy regularly enough from the surroundings to become sufficiently active once it had cooled. All polar land animals of any size therefore need to be warm-blooded to be active. The environment is so extreme that the size limit in Antarctica for an ectotherm is about 13mm, the size of the largest fully terrestrial (land) animal in Antarctica. In other words any animal larger than this would be unlikely to be able to warm up enough to become active before it started to get cold again.']"
how do pests and animals in the wild fare against chilli?,"Chilli can be an effective repellent against pests and animals in the wild.

Research has also shown that ground hot peppers or hot sauce can keep animals away from plants[3].

Fashion shows. Why are the clothes so goddamned ridiculous and people treat it with such seriousness?,"Fashion shows are often considered ridiculous because the clothes are often exaggerated and over-the-top creations that are not necessarily wearable in everyday life. Additionally, the fashion industry's obsession with youth and skinniness leads to a lot of self-loathing in society[3], and can be seen as exploiting people's insecurities. However, fashion often reflects and exaggerates society's own desires, attitudes, and values, which is why it can be so successful and why people get so upset by it[5].","[""Watching the attention whores in clown costumes who stand outside of shows begging to have their pictures taken is one of the most soul-crushing aspects of fashion week.

Fashion is a big enough joke as it is, it doesn't need a bunch of self-serious dudes in Pope-inspired capes made of Saran wrap to take it into sideshow territory.

It takes balls for someone with balls to wear a dress or someone with a vag to cut all their hair off and dress like 50 Cent. As long as you’re doing that because that’s who you are and it’s not some scheme to get famous on a fashion blog, then we are a 100 percent behind it. The world would be a much shittier, dismal place if it weren’t for weirdos like Oliver Shayne, Chromat, Jeremy Scott, and Phillipe Blond making things sexy, fun, and fierce while the rest of us hump the bed alone on a Saturday night after drinking a six pack of Coors and eating a burrito. Someone has to be creative and make a difference, so please keep doing just that.', 'The reason people – women, mainly, if we’re honest here – get so especially upset by the fashion industry’s obsession with youth and skinniness is because it is echoing that dark, cruel voice that lives in the heads of so many of us, the one that encourages our own self-loathing. For all that people criticise fashion’s obsession with thinness, the fact is it is very rare to find any non-fashion magazine that doesn’t in some way validate this view, by using very slim models or running nonsense articles about “detoxing” and “clean eating”. What the fashion industry does, really, is exploit our own worst thoughts about ourselves. Look, fashion is a billion–dollar industry, and you don’t make a billion dollars by being stupid (although an obvious exception to that rule comes in the form of future US president Donald Trump.)', 'It’s a show! It’s just not merely a fashion show. But I’m not surprised that even some people from the fashion industry won’t get it!

Minimalism will be back again someday. What I like about this show is it excites me thinking how I would style it myself mix matching everything again! That’s what outstanding about this collection, every piece is a work of art! Every piece can stand alone! Bravo Alessandro! Bravo Gucci!!', 'But here’s the rather uncomfortable truth about fashion: all it actually does is take society’s own desires, own attitudes, and exaggerate them shamelessly. This is certainly not to excuse the fashion industry’s loopiness, stupidity and even occasional amorality. But it does explain why, despite the general consensus that fashion is demented, the industry is enormously successful. This also, I suspect, clarifies why people get so upset by it. If fashion items were sold on promises to make everyone, say, grow a third arm, no one would give a good god damn. Instead, they would look at the adverts featuring three-armed models brandishing wildly expensive handbags (an extra arm so you can carry more £1,500 bags – genius!), shrug, laugh and carry on with their day. They would not campaign against these adverts on social media and newspapers would not run long think pieces about how this three-armed fascism was corrupting the minds of our young.']"
what does the united states gain from the Iran nuclear deal,"The United States stands to gain from the Iran nuclear deal by preventing a revival of Iran’s nuclear weapons program and thus reducing the prospects for conflict between Iran and its regional rivals, including Israel and Saudi Arabia[2][3].

Why do human's not drink breast milk and drink cow milk?,"Humans do not drink breast milk because it does not contain as much protein as other milks, like cow's milk[3].

"How come humans usually do not consume insects? Even though they are a great food source and most omnivores have no problem eating them, including our closest animal relatives.","Humans usually do not consume insects because they are a poor source of protein and energy compared to other food sources. Additionally, our closest animal relatives, chimpanzees, only consume a small part of their diet from other animals[4], which may suggest that humans do not rely on animal products for the same evolutionary reasons. Also, humans can easily get all their nutrients from a plant-based diet[5], which means that consuming insects is not necessary for a balanced diet.","['Omnivory is widespread among insects, both in natural and in agricultural systems. The degree to which these omnivores feed upon plant versus prey resources determines their functional role as functional herbivores or predators. Which role they play can drive ecological interactions in the community. Plants may be able to mediate this trophic role by manipulating the amount of protein available to omnivores. Understanding the interactions between plants and omnivores has provided great insight into how some mutualisms evolve in nature. Because of the importance of insect omnivores as biological control agents, understanding insect omnivory is integral to developing efficient pest control programs.', 'Plant tissue tends to be very protein-poor, which places selective pressure on herbivorous insects to obtain sufficient protein. Insects have managed to cope with this challenge in various ways. Many herbivorous insects, for example, house endosymbiotic microbes in their gut that convert carbohydrates into protein-rich nutrients (Douglas 1998). Many phloem-feeding bugs (e.g., aphids), on the other hand, filter out protein as they consume massive amounts of protein-poor plant sap; the carbon-rich, sugary honeydew that these insects produce is the protein-filtered sap. Herbivorous bugs commonly consume protein-rich pollen grains and seeds from their host plants to complement the protein-poor plant tissues they feed on most of the time. Pollen and seed consumption are considered evolutionary precursors to prey-hunting, being both nutritionally similar and requiring similar physiological adaptations to consume and digest them (Eubanks et al. 2003).', 'Coll, M., & Guershon, M. Omnivory in terrestrial arthropods: mixing plant and prey diets. Annual Review of Entomology 47, 267-297 (2002).', 'Our closest primate relatives, chimpanzees, are also considered omnivores. Yet despite the fact that chimpanzees have huge, pointed canine teeth, the flesh of other animals is only a marginal part of their diet. Dale Peterson, who has studied chimps extensively in their natural habitat, explained to us in an interview that chimps, if given the opportunity to satisfy their hunger with exclusively plant-based sources, might very well ponder the morality of eating other animals. But even if they didn’t, the energy expended to kill animals for food is far greater than that used in eating plants, which may partially explain why other animals are but a small part of the chimps’ diet.', 'A common justification for eating animals is the statement, “Humans are omnivores.” Yet, being biologically omnivorous neither compels us to eat animal products nor erases our moral obligation to minimize the harm that results from our food choices. Aside from the long-standing debate over whether humans are natural herbivores or true omnivores, if, for the sake of argument, we accept the widely-held view that humans are omnivores, this still does not change the fact that we can easily get all of our nutrients from a plant-based diet. And most of us have access to a wide range of delicious plant-based foods. Vitamin B12, the only nutrient vegans need to be vigilant about supplementing, is inexpensive and is also recommended in supplement form for non-vegans, who are equally prone to deficiencies.

"Why do some animals have recreational sex, while others do not?","There is evidence to suggest that many animals experience sexual pleasure in much the same way as humans do and that sexual pleasure can lead them to seek out sexual activities in non-reproductive contexts[1][2]. This is evidenced by the presence of the clitoris in some female mammals and female orgasm in primates[1], as well as animals engaging in masturbation, group gratification, oral sex, same-sex, or opposite-sex encounters[4]. Examples of animals that have sex for pleasure include bonobos, which mate even when pregnant, and male lions and dolphins, which form life-long same-sex pairings[5].","['It is often assumed that animals do not have sex for pleasure, or alternatively that humans, pigs, bonobos (and perhaps dolphins and one or two more species of primates) are the only species that do. This is sometimes stated as ""animals mate only for reproduction"". This view is considered a misconception by some scholars. Jonathan Balcombe argues that the prevalence of non-reproductive sexual behaviour in certain species suggests that sexual stimulation is pleasurable. He also points to the presence of the clitoris in some female mammals, and evidence for female orgasm in primates. On the other hand, it is impossible to know the subjective feelings of animals, and the notion that non-human animals experience emotions similar to humans is a contentious subject.', 'This evidence alone should lead us to expect that many animals experience sexual pleasure in much the same way that humans do — that the pleasure involved in sex leads many animals to seek it in non-reproductive contexts, and that this aspect of sexuality is not as unique as humans may like to think. This insight is surely vital to understanding sex in other species, not to mention all other aspects of their behavior too.', 'Many people believe that humans are the only beings on this planet that enjoy sex. But there are several animals that have sex for pleasure. But how do we know that these animals enjoy sex? One example is bonobos; they will mate even when pregnant, proving they get pleasure from being intimate.', 'Whether masturbation, group gratification, oral sex, same-sex, or opposite-sex encounters, animals engage in sexual behaviors not only for reproduction but also for pleasure.', ""It's a common misconception that animals only have sex in heterosexual pairs and only when the female is fertile. Bonobos were the first to prove this wrong, but when it comes to using sex for interpersonal lubrication, they're far from the only ones who do it. Life-long, same-sex pairings are the norm for some animals, including male lions and dolphins. Both sexes of many primates, including virtually all of the monkeys, seek out males and females for sexual encounters, have sex even when they could not possibly reproduce -- such as during pregnancy -- and tend to resort to it to ease high-tension social situations. These tendencies show that sex serves more than just a reproductive purpose.""]"
Why do people want to eat when they are bored?,"People often want to eat when they are bored because it is a way to break the monotony of a situation[1]. Eating can also be a coping mechanism to escape the emotions one is feeling[3].

Eating when bored releases dopamine, which can give a temporary feeling of satisfaction[1][3].","[""It's well known that people like to eat when they're bored. But why? Is it because eating food is actively pleasurable, or does it simply break the monotony (which studies have shown people can't tolerate for even 15 minutes)?

During this time, some subjects were given M&amp;Ms to munch on, and others received a device they could use to self-administer painful electric shocks.

Why do humans cook lots of their food?,"Humans cook their food for several reasons. It helps to make food softer and easier to chew, so humans can eat it with smaller teeth and weaker jaws[1]. It also helps to increase the energy they can get from the food they eat[1], as some food like starchy potatoes are barely digestible when raw. Cooking requires cognitive skills, such as the ability to resist the temptation to scoff the ingredients and an understanding of the transformation process, which is likely why Homo erectus had the cognitive and behavioural skills to cook[2]. Cooking also helps to release more calories and make food safer, as it kills off germs that cause food poisoning[5]. Additionally, cooking makes otherwise inedible foods like tubers edible[5], and it also frees up time to do more interesting activities than just finding food and eating[5].","['All known human societies eat cooked foods, and biologists generally agree cooking could have had major effects on how the human body evolved. For example, cooked foods tend to be softer than raw ones, so humans can eat them with smaller teeth and weaker jaws. Cooking also increases the energy they can get from the food they eat. Starchy potatoes and other tubers, eaten by people across the world, are barely digestible when raw. Moreover, when humans try to eat more like chimpanzees and other primates, we cannot extract enough calories to live healthily. Up to 50 percent of women who exclusively eat raw foods develop amenorrhea, or lack of menstruation, a sign the body does not have enough energy to support a pregnancy—a big problem from an evolutionary perspective.', 'Cooking requires cognitive skills that go beyond controlling fire, such as the ability to resist the temptation to scoff the ingredients, patience, memory and an understanding of the transformation process. Recent experiments with chimps found that they have many of the cognitive and behavioural skills needed for cooking – and therefore it’s likely that Homo erectus did too.', 'What is the connection between cooking and brains? Understanding how and why our brains got so big has been a major puzzle because such a brain is metabolically expensive. In fact, the brain needs more energy for its size than any other organ. Although it might seem being smarter is always better, having a big brain exerts a high toll. Ancestral humans may have compensated for this energy cost by cooking food.', 'Cooking, therefore, gave us both the nutrition we needed to develop large brains and the time we needed to use them for things more interesting than chewing.', 'Cooking certainly changed our ancestors’ lives for the better. Heat makes food softer, so less time is needed for chewing. It also releases more calories. Mice fed cooked food get fatter than those fed equivalent raw calories. Heat-treated food is also safer. Scavenged meat has high levels of pathogens. Roasting it on hot coals kills off germs that cause food poisoning. Another benefit of cooking is that it makes otherwise inedible foods, such as tubers, edible. And it frees up time to do more interesting things than just finding food and eating.']"
Do pets pick up any human qualities during their lifespan since they are technically raised by humans?,"Yes, pets do pick up some human qualities during their lifespan since they are raised by humans. Studies have shown that dogs can read facial expressions, communicate jealousy, display empathy, and watch TV[4]. They've picked up these people-like traits during their evolution from wolves to domesticated pets[4]. Additionally, researchers at Michigan State University have discovered that dogs often take on the same personality traits as their owner[5]. This suggests that pets can learn and adopt some of the human qualities they are exposed to during their lifespan.","['(ELI5) Do pets pick up any human qualities during their lifespan since they are technically raised by humans?', '- in 2022, halioua and her team, approaching 70 strong, began to flex the scientific muscles needed to upend conventional wisdom about aging. They analyzed and published data collected the previous year from nearly 500 dogs who were brought to a vet clinic for a health assessment. For a second study, they recruited some 2,000 owners—Halioua usually calls them “pet parents”—to receive Loyal-branded doggy DNA swab kits that might help them understand the markers of aging. Dog lovers on social media quickly picked up the scent; both studies filled up fast, and Halioua’s inbox was flooded with unsolicited dog pics. (Halioua says she has nothing against cats—and has even hired a few cat fanciers—but that their long lives, dislike of medicine, and not-very-humanlike physiology make them a less appealing target. “They’re like little biological aliens,” Halioua says.)', 'We are aware that this understanding draws a rather sobering picture of the often romanticized human-dog relationship. However, pet keeping is not a given or simply a result of a natural affinity between humans and animals. It is a historically contingent practice that has also been circumscribed by social class and gender constructs (Irvine, 2004, 19). This is a sociological point that links with ethical and biological perspectives: like all our relationships with companion animals, the human-dog relationship depends on how we define animals, and for that our knowledge about their abilities and needs seems crucial. For sure, it is also crucial how ready we are to take their perspective into consideration. For this, questions of power and hierarchy are relevant.', ""Dogs can read facial expressions, communicate jealousy, display empathy, and even watch TV, studies have shown.

What percentage of wild animals die of old age?,"It is difficult to determine an exact percentage of wild animals that die of old age, as it depends on the species and environment in which they live. Generally, most wild animals die shortly after coming into existence due to pain or fear from starvation, thirst, or attacks by other animals[3]. However, some species are less likely to die the older they get, such as hydras, which have low mortality rates that are constant throughout their lives[4], and desert tortoises, which become less likely to die with age[5].","['""One of the rules of The Wild is that nothing dies of old age in The Wild. It just doesn’t happen. Animals grow old, grow tired, can’t move as quickly, can’t move as well, get injured, can’t get at whatever seed or bread or foodstuffs they can find and, in the end, even predators become prey in The Wild.""', 'But in nature, aging is far more diverse, new research finds. In fact, some animals are actually less likely to die the older they get — at least up to a point.', 'The vast majority of animals in the wild die shortly after coming into existence, with their lives containing little more than the pain of their deaths. This happens because most animals have huge numbers of offspring, of which, on average, only one per parent survives to maturity. The rest die very young, most of them almost immediately after being born or hatched, and they likely die in pain or fear. We assume that it’s likely they feel pain or fear when they die because the evidence indicates that most animals are sentient (capable of feeling pain and having other experiences) and we know that the way most animals die would be painful to animals who can feel pain. This includes starvation, thirst, and attacks by other animals.', ""Still, a few studies had revealed that some species don't age as classical theory suggests, Jones said. Jellylike animals called hydras (Hydra magnipapillata) have low mortality rates that are constant throughout their lives. Hydra die so infrequently in laboratory conditions that researchers estimate it would take 1,400 years for 95 percent of a population to die of natural causes."", ""The desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) actually becomes less likely to die with age. The tortoises aren't immortal, of course — they do still die. But their mortality rate in youth is actually higher than their mortality rate in old age.

Why isn't there a hybrid offspring when one species mates with another?,"Hybrid animals are infertile because they don't have viable sex cells, meaning they cannot produce sperm or eggs[4]. This is because the chromosomes from their different species parents don't match up[4]. There may be hybrids in the natural world, but they are not able to reproduce, making them irrelevant evolutionarily, and thus can not create hybrid offspring[2][3]. Hybridization is a powerful evolutionary force, but hybrids are unable to reproduce, so they are not able to create hybrid offspring[1][2][5].","['When hybrids mate with either of their parent species, their offspring are known as backcrossed hybrids . In Figures 2A,B, we see a liger, a hybrid between a lion and tiger that has mated with a tiger. The baby from this mix, the backcrossed hybrid, still has some lion genes. If backcrossing continues for many generations (the backcrossed hybrid mates with a tiger, then its offspring does the same) the percentage of lion genes will get smaller and smaller, but they are not lost completely. This means that lion genes can eventually become part of the tiger species’ gene pool. When one species contains some of the genes of another species, it is known as introgression. This is a powerful evolutionary force, because these new genes may code for new traits or behaviors that could help the parent species .', 'Sometimes hybrids can be bad for the parental species and for the natural world. If hybrids are very successful, there may be so many hybrids that they compete with their parent species for food and living space, which could lead to the extinction of the parent species. Losing a species is bad for biodiversity and can affect other species in that habitat. When this species loss occurs naturally, scientists do not try to stop it, because it is a natural process. Loss of a parent species due to hybrid offspring is only problematic when the hybrid is created by humans and introduced to an area where the parent species were not naturally found. We must act to prevent the extinction of the parent species in these cases. But do not worry, the hybrids that we buy at the grocery store are unlikely to cause severe environmental harm, because there are rules in place to make sure they are grown with great care.', 'Because several narlugas have been spotted before, researchers suspect that the creatures may be fertile, and that some narlugas may be the product of two narluga parents rather than one beluga and one narwhal. That notion challenges naturalists’ traditional view of hybrids as the result of maladaptive crossings, such as when a female horse mates with a male donkey and gives birth to a sterile mule. If the hybrids can’t reproduce, they would seem to be irrelevant evolutionarily, but studies of the narluga and other naturally occurring hybrids have begun to hint that such offspring may not be the biological misfits they were once thought to be. They are not evolutionary dead-ends, and in some cases, may serve as evolutionary accelerators.', ""In short, hybrid animals are infertile because they don't have viable sex cells, meaning they can't produce sperm or eggs. This is the case because the chromosomes from their different species parents don't match up."", 'Have you ever heard of ligers and tigons-mixes between lions and tigers? Wolfdogs, a mix between wolves and dogs? Or maybe a grolar, a grizzly and polar bear mix? When organisms from two different species mix, or breed together, it is known as hybridization. The offspring that are produced from these mixes are known as hybrids. Hybrids occur in the natural world and are a powerful evolutionary force. They are also important in our daily lives—you probably eat hybrid plants every day. In this article, we dive into the exciting world of hybridization, describing how it occurs and what can happen when hybrids have babies.']"
Why using chicken raised with antibiotics is a bad thing,"Using chicken raised with antibiotics is a bad thing because it can lead to drug-resistant bacteria being passed on to humans, which can cause serious infections that antibiotics commonly used to treat them may be rendered ineffective[3]. It can also have a negative effect on our gut health, which has been linked to various diseases and poor digestion[1]. Additionally, the claim of “no antibiotics” does not necessarily mean that a chicken was raised entirely without antibiotics, or that antibiotics were only used according to recommended practices[4]. The use of antibiotics in chicken production also creates the conditions that allow chicken to be bland[4][5].","['Nutritionally speaking (as far as numbers go), chicken raised on antibiotics has the same calories, and macros (protein and fat) as organic chicken or chicken raised with no antibiotics. But aside from drug resistance, there’s still the possibility our gut microbiomes are altered when we consume chicken with antibiotics. Whether it’s the antibiotic itself or the drug-resistant bacteria, the introduction of either of these into our microbiomes can pose a significant risk to our health. Poor gut health has been linked to poor digestion, weight gain and even diseases like diabetes, cancer, asthma, obesity and Alzheimer’s.', 'Consuming poultry with antibiotics on occasion is not likely to be a big problem. But if you eat chicken regularly, or want to avoid chicken raised with antibiotics, look for labels with the following phrases:', 'The FDA and USDA have strict guidelines and regulations that ensure all chickens are “weaned” from antibiotics well before being processed. However, the concern isn’t that the actual antibiotic is passed on to humans during chicken consumption. Rather, the main concern is with the resistant bacteria that survives antibiotic treatments and continues to live inside the bird’s gut, which are then potentially passed on to humans. Thus, people who ingest these bacteria can develop infections resistant to antibiotics, meaning antibiotics doctors commonly use to treat them are rendered ineffective. Such infections can be especially dangerous for people with compromised immune systems such as those with chronic inflammatory conditions, the elderly, people with HIV/AIDS or those being treated for cancer.', 'The claim of “no antibiotics” can mean different things depending on who is saying it. It does not necessarily mean that a chicken was raised entirely without antibiotics, or that antibiotics were only used according to recommended practices. The Antibiotics Off the Menu Coalition website has a list of third-party-verified labels to look for if you decide to purchase chicken that was raised with responsible antibiotic use. Fortunately there is a plethora of plant-based alternatives to chicken that are becoming more accessible every day, in addition to standard plant-based proteins like beans and tofu.', 'Antibiotics do not create blandness, but they created the conditions that allowed chicken to be bland, allowing us to turn a skittish, active backyard bird into a fast-growing, slow-moving, docile block of protein, as muscle-bound and top-heavy as a bodybuilder in a kids’ cartoon. At this moment, most meat animals, across most of the planet, are raised with the assistance of doses of antibiotics on most days of their lives: 63,151 tons of antibiotics per year, about 126m pounds.']"
why don't we put all the severely endangered species in captivity where they are safe from bad guys and can make babies,"Putting all severely endangered species in captivity is not a viable solution for their survival. Even though zoos claim to be breeding animals with the intent of replenishing threatened populations, the reality is that most zoos have no involvement of any kind with any reintroduction programmes. Furthermore, many captive animal venues are focused on profiting off the backs of animals for entertainment, with no chance of them being released into the wild[3]. Additionally, releasing animals born in captivity into their natural habitat can be tricky, as they may not know the local ""language"" and can place the wild population at risk[4]. Finally, some species are particularly unsuited to captivity in any form, and existing regulations do very little to stop their suffering[5].","['“Most animals confined in zoos are not endangered, nor are they being prepared for release into natural habitats. In fact, it is nearly impossible to release captive-bred animals, including threatened species like elephants, polar bears, gorillas, tigers and chimpanzees into the wild. Zoos aren’t breeding animals with the intent of replenishing threatened populations: Babies bring visitors through the gates, and captive breeding gives the public a false sense of security about a species’ survival. But that belief undermines support for and diverts resources from in-situ conservation efforts.”', 'The vast majority of species kept in zoos are not endangered. And while there’s a commonly held misconception that zoos reintroduce endangered animals into their native habitats, in reality, most zoos have no involvement of any kind with any reintroduction programmes. This means that captive-bred species that do face extinction – including elephants, polar bears, gorillas, tigers, chimpanzees, and pandas – are rarely, if ever, released into their natural environments to bolster dwindling populations.', 'While some captive animal venues tout their conservation efforts, their main focus is profiting off the backs of animals for entertainment. The majority of captive wildlife venues, such as zoos and aquariums, do just enough to justify the cruel and archaic practice of breeding baby animals to spend their lifetimes in captivity, often forced to live in tiny enclosures, giving rides, or performing in shows, with no chance of being released into the wild.', 'Releasing animals born in captivity into their natural habitat can also be tricky. Songbirds, for example, are very difficult to re-introduce to their natural habitat, because their peers teach them the local “language” in the wild. They can’t learn the songbook in captivity. Re-introduction can also place the wild population at risk, as it did in 1991, when a once-captive toad brought the deadly chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis to the island of Mallorca.', 'Some species – animals like orcas or elephants who travel long distances in the wild, for instance – are particularly unsuited to captivity in any form. So any existing regulations do very little to stop the routine suffering that comes from denying animals their freedom and autonomy.']"

Additionally, classic literature can shape our personality and inner self[2]. On the other hand, classic movies like Gone with the Wind, Wizard of Oz, or Citizen Kane may not be as beneficial for students since there is a possibility that they may not be able to fully understand and engage with the major themes presented in these movies.

"Why does the US/Likud care so much if Iran develops nuclear technology, but could care less about North Korea, a US enemy that actually has warheads?","The US/Likud care so much if Iran develops nuclear technology because they are worried that Iran, under its current regime, is aiming to acquire nuclear weapons and use them to gain leverage over oil-producing countries in the region, thus disrupting the flow of oil and the world economy[1]. They are also concerned that Iran could use nuclear weapons to destroy Israel, as two-thirds of Israeli Jews think Iran would do[2]. In contrast, North Korea has already successfully developed nuclear weapons, so the US is not as worried about North Korea developing nuclear technology. Furthermore, Iran's leaders have stated that they do not wish to acquire nuclear weapons, but rather to retain nuclear capabilities to deter foreign aggression, much like Japan[5].","[""Iran is entitled to nuclear technology but not under this undemocratic regime. Say what you want, but this regime is aiming for nuclear weapons as the only way of insuring it's filthy existence.

A mullah with nuclear arsenals a stone throw away from these oil fields could bring the world economy to a halt and of course that is unimaginable.

Khamenei and others insist that Iran will not acquire nuclear weapons, but, to paraphrase former Iranian president Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran will retain adequate nuclear capabilities and know-how so that its neighbors will draw the proper conclusions, much as Japan’s neighbors are aware that it could produce nuclear weapons if it needed to.']"
Why do humans need to cook food?,"Humans need to cook food in order to make it easier to digest and extract more energy from food, as well as to help them gain weight. Cooking also helps break down collagen, the connective tissue in meat, and softens the cell walls of plants to release their stores of starch and fat[4]. Eating cooked foods also allows humans to eat with smaller teeth and weaker jaws, and to get enough calories to live healthily[5]. Additionally, cooking was likely adopted at around 500,000 years ago, as this is when there is evidence for hearths and purposefully built fires[3].","['Humans (species in the genus Homo) are the only animals that cook their food, and Wrangham argues Homo erectus emerged about two million years ago as a result of this unique trait. Cooking had profound evolutionary effect because it increased food efficiency, which allowed human ancestors to spend less time foraging, chewing, and digesting. H. erectus developed a smaller, more efficient digestive tract, which freed up energy to enable larger brain growth. Wrangham also argues that cooking and control of fire generally affected species development by providing warmth and helping to fend off predators, which helped human ancestors adapt to a ground-based lifestyle. Wrangham points out that humans are highly evolved for eating cooked food and cannot maintain reproductive fitness with raw food.', 'If Wrangham is right, cooking not only gave early humans the energy they needed to build bigger brains but also helped them get more calories from food so that they could gain weight. In the modern context the flip side of his hypothesis is that we may be victims of our own success. We have gotten so good at processing foods that for the first time in human evolution, many humans are getting more calories than they burn in a day. “Rough breads have given way to Twinkies, apples to apple juice,” he writes. “We need to become more aware of the calorie-raising consequences of a highly processed diet.”', 'Such evidence suggests modern humans are biologically dependent on cooking. But at what point in our evolutionary history was this strange new practice adopted? Some researchers think cooking is a relatively recent innovation—at most 500,000 years old. Cooking requires control of fire, and there is not much archaeological evidence for hearths and purposefully built fires before this time.', 'In essence, cooking—including not only heat but also mechanical processes such as chopping and grinding—outsources some of the body’s work of digestion so that more energy is extracted from food and less expended in processing it. Cooking breaks down collagen, the connective tissue in meat, and softens the cell walls of plants to release their stores of starch and fat. The calories to fuel the bigger brains of successive species of hominids came at the expense of the energy-intensive tissue in the gut, which was shrinking at the same time—you can actually see how the barrel-shaped trunk of the apes morphed into the comparatively narrow-waisted Homo sapiens. Cooking freed up time, as well; the great apes spend four to seven hours a day just chewing, not an activity that prioritizes the intellect.', 'All known human societies eat cooked foods, and biologists generally agree cooking could have had major effects on how the human body evolved.

"If protein is required to gain muscle, how do animals like cows get the meat we eat?","Animals like cows get the meat that we eat by eating plants which are a source of complete proteins that our bodies can synthesize[1]. Cows and other herbivores are able to digest plant cells and extract the nutrients, such as protein, inside them[3]. Despite this, beef producers still often need to supplement their protein levels to ensure optimal productivity and health[4]. The misconception that animal proteins are better for building muscle has been debunked in recent years, as plant proteins are just as capable as animal proteins for building muscle[1].","['The common misconception is that animal proteins are better in terms of recovery time and rebuilding muscle. What is true is that for a protein to build muscle it requires a certain “complete” structure of amino acids. Animal products are a “complete protein” innately because they were already synthesized by the animal in the creation of their muscles and milk. However, our bodies are just as capable of synthesizing these proteins from components found in various plants. Think about it. Cows, pigs, lambs, and chickens are the major animals sourced for meat protein and they all eat purely plant-based diets. In fact, they eat only one or two types of plants and yet they somehow turn it into protein to develop all of their muscle.', 'Recent studies have also proven the inaccuracy of the misconception that animal proteins are better for building muscle. A study published in 2017 in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that dietary protein derived from plant sources is no different than that from meat sources.', 'When you think of protein rich foods, you probably envision meat, eggs, beans and the like.

Why does our body naturally crave sweets and fats and not healthier foods?,"Our bodies naturally crave sweets and fats because they are rich sources of energy and calories, which were essential for survival in our evolutionary past. Additionally, there may be a genetic link to cravings for high sugar and high fat foods[3]. Furthermore, consuming sweet and salty foods triggers the release of dopamine, a brain chemical that motivates us to engage in rewarding behaviors[4]. Finally, over-consumption of sweet foods is made possible by modern technology and the abundance of fruits in affluent nations[5].","[""If you want to be healthy, you shouldn't completely ignore your evolutionary craving for sugary foods. Rather, direct this craving towards eating moderate amounts of whole fruits, while cutting back on candy, fruit juice, soda pop, and sugary baked goods."", ""Craving sugar is what your body was designed to do. Many of the nutrient-dense foods we should be eating daily have naturally occurring sugars already in them. If you consistently eat these foods, regulate stress, and practice good sleep hygiene, your cravings should subside and you'll be sneaking into the cookie jar much less often."", 'According to the National Institutes of Health, lab studies involving mice indicate that craving high sugar, high fat foods may have a genetic link.', '“Many people say they’re ‘sugar addicts,’ consuming real sugar and artificial sweeteners in various forms,” says Taylor. And some sweet and salty foods and drinks are incredibly addictive. That’s why many processed foods are loaded with them. They trigger the release of dopamine, a brain chemical that motivates us to engage in rewarding behaviors.', 'Now fast forward millions of years to our modern age. With improved agricultural technology, rich countries became able to grow fruits cheaply and in abundance. Instead of being rare caches of calories that could boost survival, fruits became staple foods that could be consumed anytime. The innate craving for sweet foods was still present in humans, but the scarcity of such foods was no longer a problem for many people, leading to over-consumption. This situation still holds true today in affluent nations. In short, the advancement of technology has made it easy for many of us to eat far more sweet foods than our bodies are able to handle. Craving and eating sugar in the amounts and forms that our ancient ancestors encountered is quite healthy. Craving and eating sugar in much larger amounts and in extracted forms is what is unhealthy.']"

One-fifth said they always or often had to be available for call-in shifts, according to the survey, which was overseen by researchers at City University of New York.', 'Practices such as lean staffing and unstable scheduling have flourished in the guise of enabling greater profits for retailers. In fact, studies have shown these practices have hidden costs.

Moreover, labor productivity increased by 5%, in an industry where productivity grew by only 2.5% per year between 1987 and 2014.

Many retailers now use sophisticated software that tracks the flow of customers, allowing managers to assign just enough employees to handle the anticipated demand.', 'Store managers consistently identified three ways HQ created schedule instability. Last-minute changes in shipment dates or inaccuracies in the number of units meant that a store received 5,000 units on Thursday instead of the 2,000 units it had been told to expect on Tuesday; this wreaked havoc with posted schedules. Last-minute changes in marketing meant that merchandise had to be marked down, tables set up, stock moved around, signs made, windows changed — and sometimes there were three different promotions in a single week. The third was leadership visits, which meant extra hours were spent ensuring the store looked perfect. To quote one manager, “If payroll is such a commodity, I feel it’s crucial to spend it on the business versus visits. This isn’t a museum. You know we aren’t curating a museum.” All meant that hours had to be added here and subtracted there, after the schedule was posted.', 'This is a great article, but I have to disagree with one part…it currently is not “OK” to ask for less hours at work. Unfortunately, this could get you fired. The general consensus in the corporate arena is that they feel they own your physical person and are free to do with it as they chose even if there is no increase in productivity. A perfect example is during Hurricane Sandy when many places had no electricity, some employees were still made to come into work and sit in the dark doing nothing for 8 hours. Corporations routinely classify all salaried employees as exempt (not due overtime pay) and fire staff so one person is now doing the job of 3 with a 70 hour workweek. I would, however, love to see all this change. I fear though with unemployment at the rate it is now, we wage slaves currently have no pull to affect any change soon.']"
Trees sharing a branch.,"Trees often form alliances with other trees of the same species or other species[4][5]. These alliances are maintained by communication and a collective intelligence, which is similar to an insect colony[5]. Trees can also share a branch if the tree trunk is divided by the property lines of two or more people, which is referred to as a ""boundary tree""[2]. Trees have also been known to recognize other trees of their own species and share nutrients with them through their mycorrhizal network[4]. This behavior is known as “kin recognition”[4].","['On the way to the Heavenly Lake near Urumqi in China are a pair of trees that local people have called the Husband and Wife trees because they are connected by a living branch. The Tatajia Husband and Wife trees are in Taiwan and in Yakushima, Kagoshima-ken, Japan, are a pair of Husband and Wife trees formed from conjoined cedars.', 'When the tree trunk is divided by the property lines of two or more people, it is referred to as a ""boundary tree.""

The American Association for the Advancement of Science, The Scientific Monthly, 47(1): pp 80-85. https://www.jstor.org/stable/16824.', 'By investigating the different interactions between species of trees, scientists found that trees leverage similarities and differences in their microbial “makeup” to recognize other trees of their own species, and they preferentially share nutrients with them through their mycorrhizal network. This behavior, known as “kin recognition,” was recently explored when multiple families of Douglas Fir trees were planted in a plot and carbon tracing experiments indicated that trees of the same family shared more carbon than between trees of different families. Scientists are still investigating why this is happening, but it is hypothesized that all plants evolved to have kin recognition for reproductive purposes. Similarly, there is cross-talk between different species of trees that share the same mycorrhizal network, such as between Birch and Fir trees (Figure 3). Interspecies tree communication has been shown to increase the fitness and resiliency of trees.', 'There is now a substantial body of scientific evidence that refutes that idea. It shows instead that trees of the same species are communal, and will often form alliances with trees of other species. Forest trees have evolved to live in cooperative, interdependent relationships, maintained by communication and a collective intelligence similar to an insect colony. These soaring columns of living wood draw the eye upward to their outspreading crowns, but the real action is taking place underground, just a few inches below our feet.']"
Why are pedigree animals considered 'pedigree' when their inherent inbreeding makes them genetically problematic and shortens their life span?,"Pedigree animals are considered 'pedigree' because inbreeding increases the likelihood that they will share desired traits such as their physical characteristics, resulting in offspring that are predictably similar[2]. This has been the foundation for the development of pedigree breeds as it allows breeders to maintain specific traits from a common ancestor[2]. However, inbreeding has negative consequences as it can lead to genetic defects and inherited diseases[3] and inbreeding depression[1][2][3][4][5], which can be detrimental to the health and welfare of the animals[3][5].","['Inbreeding in pedigree dogs arises because certain dogs, prized for exhibiting the characteristics desirable for that breed, are used to father many litters of puppies. When dogs from these litters come to be mated, some will be paired with dogs having the same father from other litters. Over generations, more and more dogs across a particular pedigree are related to one another and the chances of relatives mating increase.', 'Inbreeding reduces the genetic variation within that breed or population. Inbreeding has been a common practice in companion animals (and other domesticated species) as it increases the likelihood that animals will share desired traits such as their physical characteristics because they are genetically similar [1, 2]. Inbreeding has been the foundation for the development of pedigree(pure bred) breeds as it results in offspring who are predictably similar, because of the fact that their genetic similarity maintains specific traits from a common ancestor (i.e., the genetic similarity of dogs of the Labrador breed means they look the same; they look like a Labrador) [2, 3].', 'However, the effects of inbreeding accumulate within closed populations (e.g., within purebred breeds) and negative consequences can result from breeding parents who are too genetically similar. Inbred animals are more likely to have genetic defects and inherited diseases [2, 4], which can be extremely detrimental to their health and welfare. Examples include Polycystic Kidney Disease in Persian cats (leading to kidney failure), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in Maine Coon cats and Mitral Valve Disease in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (both diseases leading to heart failure), and spinal abnormalities in British and French Bulldogs, Boston Terriers and pugs.', 'Breeding from closely related animals predisposes the offspring to genetic defects or inherited disorders and inbreeding depression . Close inbreeding (breeding first and second-degree relatives), substantially increases the risk of genetic defects or inherited disorders and inbreeding depression and these occur at a faster rate, compared to inbreeding of less closely related individuals .', 'The evidence demonstrates that inbreeding has significant negative impacts on animal health and welfare. Therefore, the RSPCA is opposed to the inbreeding of companion animals including first-degree (e.g. father to daughter) and second-degree (e.g. grandfather to granddaughter) matings, as this increases the incidence of inherited disorders and compromises immune system function, both of which adversely impact the health and welfare of companion animals. People who breed companion animals must prioritise the health, behaviour, and welfare of both breeding animals and offspring. Parents should be chosen who are not closely related and are physically and behaviourally sound.']"
"I can buy a 'complete' food for my pets that gives them all the nutrients they need in one serving of homogeneous 'nuggets', why hasn't such a thing been made for humans?","Making a complete and balanced pet food that provides all the nutrition needed by humans is a complex task. Pet food is a specialty food that is formulated according to the nutritional needs of cats and dogs using ingredients such as meat, meat byproducts, cereals, grains, vitamins, and minerals[1][2]. These ingredients are carefully selected based upon their nutrient profile and their contribution to producing products that provide complete nutrition[3]. Additionally, pet food manufacturers use preservatives to extend the shelf life, flavor, and smell of pantry pet foods and these are typically tested by the FDA or another governing body to ensure the food is safe for pets to consume[5]. Human nutrition is much more complex than that of cats and dogs, and it is difficult to create a homogeneous food that provides all the required nutrients for humans. Therefore, it is recommended to consult with a nutritionist to create a balanced diet for humans rather than relying on one single food item.","['Making a complete and balanced pet food that provides all the nutrition needed by a cat or dog is a complex task. Veterinarians have identified between 42 and 48 essential nutrients for cats and dogs.

Adding to the complexity of ingredients is the formal process by which these materials are defined.', ""Pet food is a specialty food for domesticated animals that is formulated according to their nutritional needs. Pet food generally consists of meat, meat byproducts, cereals, grain, vitamins, and minerals.

If the Ancient Egyptians were so liberal on many things (Women and mental/physical disorders etc.) why did they own slaves and how did they justify it?,"The Ancient Egyptians owned slaves as a sign of power and prestige and to use them as labor in fields and households. Slaves were mostly obtained from foreign lands and were seen as property to be bought and sold by private dealers[2]. Slaves were capable of negotiating transactions and owning personal property and were generally given food but not wages[3]. In some cases, individuals were unable to pay off their debts and were sold into slavery by their creditors[4].","['Masters of Ancient Egypt were under obligations when owning slaves. Masters were allowed to utilize the abilities of their slaves by employing them in different manners including domestic services (cooks, maids, brewers, nannies, etc.) and labor services (gardeners, stable hands, field hands, etc.). Masters also had the right to force the slave to learn a trade or craft to make the slave more valuable. Masters were forbidden to force child slaves to harsh physical labor.', 'Egyptian slaves, specifically during the New Kingdom era, originated from foreign lands. The slaves themselves were seen as an accomplishment to Egyptian kings\' reign, and a sign of power. Slaves or bak were seen as property or a commodity to be bought and sold. Their human qualities were disregarded and were merely seen as property to be used for a master\'s labor. Unlike the more modern term, ""serf"", Egyptian slaves were not tied to the land; the owner(s) could use the slave for various occupational purposes. The slaves could serve towards the productivity of the region and community. Slaves were generally men, but women and families could be forced into the owner\'s household service.', 'Many slaves who worked for temple estates lived under punitive conditions, but on average the Ancient Egyptian slave led a life similar to a serf. They were capable of negotiating transactions and owning personal property. Chattel and debt slaves were given food but probably not given wages.', ""Ancient Egyptians were able to sell themselves and children into slavery in a form of bonded labor. Self-sale into servitude was not always a choice made by the individuals' free will, but rather a result of individuals who were unable to pay off their debts. The creditor would wipe the debt by acquiring the individual who was in debt as a slave, along with his children and wife. The debtor would also have to give up all that was owned. Peasants were also able to sell themselves into slavery for food or shelter."", 'Ancient Egypt was a peasant-based economy and it was not until the Greco-Roman period that slavery had a greater impact. Slave dealing in Ancient Egypt was done through private dealers and not through a public market. The transaction had to be performed before a local council or officials with a document containing clauses that were used in other valuable sales. However Pharaohs were able to bypass this, and possessed the power to give slaves to any they saw fit, usually being a vizier or noble.']"
Can different types of animals understand or communicate with each other?,"Yes, different types of animals can understand and communicate with each other. Animals can communicate with other like animals of the same species, as well as with different species[2]. Animals communicate with each other in many different ways, including body language, sound, smell, touch, and even chemical and electrical communication[3]. They can use their voices, as well as other methods of communication, to communicate with one another[3].

Do animals adapt to and eventually understand the language spoken around them?,"While some animals such as whales, songbirds, bats, and dolphins have been found to be able to understand different accents from other parts of the world, it is not known if they are able to learn to actually speak the language[5].

Awesome post!', 'Language unquestionably represents the pinnacle of evolved animal communication systems, and as noted at the beginning of this section, attempts to teach language to animals have not significantly changed this view. Language is often given pride of place in human evolution. In this view the other adaptations mentioned above came only after some form of language was in place. I favor the view of Hrdy (2009), that this may well reverse cause and effect. The evolution of language may have only become possible when the posited unique suite of prosocial, communicative and mind-reading adaptations were in place. The crucial importance of communication in the strongly interdependent social system of early humans would have created this prosocial suite of adaptations, and would have laid the groundwork for evolving a true language.', 'In the last half century, much effort has been put trying answer that question by teaching animals, primarily apes, a basic language. There have been some limited successes, with animals using signs to obtain things in which they were interested, for instance. But no animal has yet acquired the linguistic capability that children have already in their third year of life.', 'Obviously, humans have hundreds of different languages spoken all over the world. Are we the only ones though?

They found that the macaques didn’t learn they customs or cultures in the new settings, even when being raised by a different regions macaques parents. This lead to the conclusion that an animals ability to communicate is completely within its genes, and is not able to adapt and learn a different “language” so to speak.

Whales, songbirds, bats, and dolphins were all found to be able to “speak” in a certain dialect or accent in accordance to where they are from, but are able to understand accents from other parts of the world.

"Instead of processed foods (e.g. boxed cereal, hamburger helper) why aren't whole foods given to the poor more often?","Whole foods are often more expensive than processed foods, which can make them inaccessible to people with lower incomes[4].

"Why do different meats (pork, beef, chicken) taste different if they're all just muscle?","Different meats taste different because they are made up of different types of muscles that require different amounts of oxygen and myoglobin.

White meats, like chicken breasts and beef, are mostly “fast twitch” muscles, which are better suited for brief bursts of energy, and they have less myoglobin[4].

How are humans susceptible to diseases caused by animals but otherwise wouldn't attract.,"Humans are susceptible to zoonotic diseases caused by animals, which are infectious diseases that have jumped from a non-human animal to humans[2].

These diseases can also be transmitted by domesticated and farm animals, such as pigs, chickens, turkeys, waterfowl, cows, and camels[5]. The risk of zoonotic diseases is increasing due to urbanization, destruction of natural habitats, and climate change[1].","['Zoonotic pathogens can spread to humans through any contact point with domestic, agricultural or wild animals. Markets selling the meat or by-products of wild animals are particularly high risk due to the large number of new or undocumented pathogens known to exist in some wild animal populations.

"Why do some animal groups, such as birds and mammals, care for their young, while others do not?","Parental care is seen in many species, including insects, fishes, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and especially mammals[1][2]. Birds in particular have distinctive ways of caring for their young, with 90% of bird species displaying biparental care and 9% displaying alloparental care[2]. Mammals share two major adaptations for care of the young, namely gestation and production of milk[1][4]. Furthermore, humans and some animal groups are notable for spending a long time in dependent childhood, and the parents often provide food, introductions, and territory for their young[3].","[""Parental care is seen in many insects, notably the social insects such as ants, bees and wasps; in certain fishes, such as the mouthbrooders; widely in birds; in amphibians; some reptiles and especially widely in mammals, which share two major adaptations for care of the young, namely gestation (development of the embryo inside the mother's body) and production of milk."", 'Birds are distinctive in the way they care for their young. 90% of bird species display biparental care, including 9% of species with alloparental care, or helpers at the nest. Biparental care may have originated in the stem reptiles (archosaurs) that gave rise to the birds, before they developed flight. In the remainder of bird species, female-only care is prevalent, and male-only care is rare. Most birds, including passerines (perching birds), have their young born blind, naked and helpless (altricial), totally dependent for their survival on parental care. The young are typically raised in a nest; the parents catch food and regurgitate it for the young. Some birds such as pigeons create a ""crop milk"" which they similarly regurgitate. David Lack developed a hypothesis that clutch size has evolved in response to the costs of parental care known as Lack\'s principle. It has since seen modifications but is still used as a general model.', 'Humans are notable for the long time we spend in dependent childhood and adolescence compared with other species, but we may not be such outliers after all. Many wild animal parents do not cut off support the minute their offspring leaves. In fact, many dial up the help and the training.

Some bequeath territory and offer access to food larders they’ve been stocking away.', 'There is maternal care in all species of mammals, and while 95% of species exhibit female-only care, in only 5% biparental care is present.[citation needed] Thus, there are no known cases of male-only care in mammals. The major adaptation shared by all live-bearing mammals for care of their young after birth is lactation (the feeding of milk from the mammary glands).[citation needed] Further, many mammals exhibit other parental care behaviors to increase the fitness of their offspring, for example, building a den, feeding, guarding, carrying, huddling, grooming and teaching their young. Others, consider also as a type of care when males provision the pregnant females.', 'In many species of birds and mammals, young adults old enough to be “ready” to move out are sometimes allowed — even encouraged — to stay in the home territory and help out. Occasionally these aunts and uncles stay home for life. The arrangement is win-win-win for parents, offspring and new younger siblings. The young adults care for siblings by bringing food and acting as babysitters and mentors; they help the group by adding vigilance and security and extra numbers for mobs.

What is lab-grown meat?,"Lab-grown meat is meat that is grown from a tissue biopsy of cells taken from an animal[1][2][4][5].

"Why are PETA, as an animal organization, seemingly doing everything it can to destroy pet's lives? Aren't they supposed to help animals?","PETA, as an animal organization, is seemingly doing everything it can to destroy pet's lives because they do not believe in pet ownership. Ingrid Newkirk, the founder of PETA, has called pet ownership “an abysmal situation” and believes that people should seek companionship with their own kind[2]. PETA is also obsessively risk-averse when it comes to pets, believing that most people can’t be trusted with the care of a pet, so they simply kill them or advocate for killing them[3]. They are blind to the effects of depriving an animal of its most fundamental right — the right to life[3]. Furthermore, PETA is also known to sabotage farm animal welfare progress[5]. Therefore, it is important to consider alternatives to PETA and find different sources of information to educate oneself before supporting their organization[4].","['Chrissie Hynde, former lead singer of The Pretenders and a Peta supporter, said: “It’s curious that the meat and tobacco industries, who destroy innumerable human lives with their ‘goods’, and billions of animals producing them, try to incite public outrage by throwing stones at a charity who’s very existence is to promote the welfare of animals and offer to put suffering animals out of their misery.”', 'Why does PETA kill cats and dogs by the thousands instead of finding them homes? Simply, PETA does not believe in pet ownership.

If they want companionship, they should seek it with their own kind.”', 'PETA, too, is obsessively risk-averse when it comes to pets. Like hoarders, they believe that most people can’t be trusted with the care of a pet, but rather than keep them under lock and key, PETA simply kills them or advocates for killing them.

They would rather go after companies and farmers who have actually worked very hard to raise the animals the right way.']"
Why do we not harness the energy produced from workout equipment in a gym?

For one, it was concluded that this energy source does not generate substantial amounts of electricity or cost savings in electricity bills to be considered by users and gyms[2]. Additionally, participants were not aware of how this technology could contribute to reducing our environmental impact[2]. Furthermore, the power output for fitness equipment can’t be compared apples to apples with solar or wind due to the limitations of human power and motivation[3]. Lastly, connecting the electricity wires of fitness machines in gyms to the local substation would require significant effort and resources[5].","['Turns out that over the past decade, scientists and engineers have been designing energy harvesting technology that captures, converts and stores small quantities of energy from a variety of naturally occurring energy sources; one of them being from kinetic energy produced from human exercise. In fact, a handful of gym equipment manufacturers (including the manufacturer the Pleasance gym bought equipment from) offer different retrofitted exercise equipment such as spin bikes and elliptical machines, to harness kinetic energy produced from human exercise and convert it into usable electricity. So why were gyms, like the Pleasance gym who was already taking energy efficiency measures and had a relationship with a potential supplier, not investing in this technology?', 'For the gym, leisure centre and home context it was concluded that this energy source does not generate substantial amounts of electricity or cost savings in electricity bills to be considered by users and gyms.

How are we able to know the distances/size of objects in space?,"Astronomers use a variety of methods to measure distances in space, known as the 'cosmic distance ladder', which includes units such as the astronomical unit (au) and the light-year (ly)[1]. One method that astronomers use to measure distances to galaxies that are farther away is surface brightness fluctuations (SBF)[3][4][5]. This involves comparing the color and bumpiness of galaxies that are closer to Earth to those of galaxies that are farther away. Measuring distances in space is important as it helps astronomers understand how the universe works and enables them to test theories such as dark matter, dark energy, and other mysteries of the universe[3][5].","['It is not an easy thing to measure the distances to objects in the universe since these objects are usually very far away. We can\'t just run out there with a ruler! To measure distances in the universe, we will need to construct what is commonly referred to as a ""cosmic distance ladder"". In other words, astronomers use different methods to determine the distances to objects; the specific method which is used depends on how far away the object is. But all of the methods are wonderful combinations of science and mathematics!', 'To understand distances in space, you should know about common measurement units such as the astronomical unit (au) and the light-year (ly).', 'So, we know that understanding distances in space is important, because this information will help us learn how the universe works. But why is SBF important to use? If you remember how big space is, and how everything is super far away, it is really difficult to measure the distances to far-away galaxies. We know how far away some galaxies are, but generally, the ones we know about are really close to Earth. If we want to measure the distance to a galaxy that is farther away, we can compare its color and bumpiness to those qualities of galaxies that are closer, and then make a distance measurement from those data. So, SBF can give us the distance to a galaxy that we otherwise would not have been able to measure.', 'It is pretty cool that space is so huge, or at least I think so. But how do we even know how big space is? There are many different ways to measure things in space, but I focus on measuring distance to galaxies using a very special method called surface brightness fluctuations (SBF). To explain how SBF works, take a close look at the phone or computer screen you are reading this on. If the screen is really close to your face, you will be able to see the pixels, or the tiny lights that make up the image you see, on the screen. Now, back away until you are no longer able to see the pixels.', 'There are a lot of reasons to measure distances to galaxies, even though it can be a lot of work. If we do not know the distance to a galaxy, we cannot figure out how big the galaxy is, we would not know how big the galaxy’s black hole is, or how much stuff is in that galaxy, among so many things. It is very difficult to test other cool theories that astronomers have, such as theories of dark matter, dark energy, and other mysteries of the universe, if we do not know how far away things are! If we never figure out how to measure distances in space, we would not be able to understand what the universe is really like.']"

"Do aquatic animals stay in the same stretch of river? If so, wouldn't they have to constantly swim against the river current?","Aquatic animals do not necessarily stay in the same stretch of river. They are adapted to different water velocities and can modify their behavior accordingly, such as using less energy when swimming upstream against a current. They can also use rheotaxis, which is a behavior whereby they actively swim against the oncoming water flow to avoid potentially dangerous areas downstream[4]. Some fish also take advantage of turbulent eddies to conserve energy when swimming upstream[3]. River fish are well adapted to life in the current, so they don't necessarily have to constantly swim against the river current[5].","['Stream organisms of all kinds have physical and behavioral adaptations to varying water velocities.

The river does much of the work.', 'A fundamental and often neglected feature of life on Earth is that all organisms live immersed in fluids.

Whether it’s nuclear war or massive global warming, post disaster earth would be way more habitable than Mars.', 'The real problems have to do with human nature and economics. First, we live on a planet that is perfect for us, and we seem to be unable to prevent ourselves from making it less and less habitable. We’re like a bunch of teenagers destroying our parents’ mansion in one long, crazy party, figuring that our backup plan is to run into the forest and build our own house. We’ll worry about how to get food and a good sound system later.

By terraforming, scientists are referring to the hypothetical prospect of geoengineering a planet to make it habitable for humans and other life. For Mars, that would mean the injection of oxygen and other gases into the atmosphere to raise surface temperature and air pressure, among other interventions. A common argument in favor of colonizing Mars is that it’ll allow us to begin the process of transforming the planet to a habitable state.

How do we know climate change is caused by humans?,"We know that climate change is caused by humans due to an understanding of basic physics and comparing observations with models[2].

"why do animals at the zoo often look very healthy and in shape, despite a relatively sedentary life style?","Animals at the zoo often look very healthy and in shape due to a combination of factors. Zookeepers provide them with a healthy diet and ensure that their enclosures are clean and comfortable. Additionally, some species tend to be healthier, longer-lived, and more fecund than their wild counterparts[3], and zoo visitors are more likely to view active, engaged animals than those who are sedentary[4]. Finally, the animals get very little exercise in their small enclosures, which may contribute to obesity, as well as high stress levels, which can be caused by transfers between zoos and separations from their mothers[5].","['When individuals in captivity live to be senior citizens, unique welfare problems can emerge. One study, for example, found that aged zoo animals, despite appearing healthy, often suffer from chronic health conditions, such as painful osteoarthritis, that go undiagnosed by zoo veterinary staff. On the other hand, over the past several years, as researchers and zoo staff have become better at recognizing the welfare challenges of geriatric animals, some zoos actually spend considerable energy and resources taking care of elderly or ill animals who cannot be displayed. Thus, it is not always true that animals living for a long time is good for a zoo’s bottom line. Moreover, although some species and some individuals may have longer lifespans in captivity, there are many species and individuals who do not.', 'Zoo officials insisted there were no problems, and the animals were doing just fine. Steve Feldman, a spokesman for the AZA, said in a news interview that the zoo had recently been evaluated and had met the AZA’s rigorous criteria for animal welfare, and that the events at the National Zoo were just natural. “The circle of life that occurs for all living things repeats itself in zoos on a daily basis,” he said. “Just as with humans, we notice more when it happens to celebrities, we tend to take more notice when these things happen at a place like the National Zoo because their zoo animals are the celebrities of the animal world.”', 'As University of Guelph’s Georgia Mason notes, the diverse species held in zoos vary “in the propensities for good captive health and welfare.” Some species tend to be healthier, longer-lived, and more fecund than their wild counterparts; others survive and breed less well in captivity, and seem to suffer more psychologically. Why?', 'As in the other animal-centered venues we’ve discussed so far, money is one of the key drivers of zoo-animal welfare. Zoos have discovered that good welfare is more profitable, at least on the whole, than poor welfare. The one-hundred-million-odd people who visit zoos each year in the United States, for example, want to view animals who are active and engaged. It is much more fun to watch a lion stalking past the viewing window than to watch a lion sleeping or pacing back and forth, and far more entertaining to watch penguins dive and swim than to see them huddled on a fake glacier in a refrigerated cage.', 'Many of the deaths are thought to be linked to obesity, because the animals are well fed but get very little exercise in their small enclosures.

Why doesn't our natural survival instinct kick in against thoughts of suicide in some people?,"According to the references provided, it appears that the natural survival instinct against thoughts of suicide in some people may not kick in because of the presence of a third element, which is the acquired ability for lethal self-injury[3]. People can acquire this ability by repeatedly experiencing pain, injury, and death[5], which can make them become fearless about it. Other theories suggest that suicidal behavior may be beneficial to surviving kin, or an adaptive act that removes the person from undesirable conditions of survival[1][4]. However, the self-preservation drive, or the fear of pain, injury, and death, usually protects people from death by suicide[5].","['“I think that to stand or sit there and go against every single survival instinct in your body and act on those truly horrendous, awful, dark thoughts, whilst knowing the consequences of what you’re about to do to yourself, shows that it’s an illness and that it certainly is not a cry for attention. To go against your survival instincts and go ahead with any action to end your life, and to spare what you perceive is the burden you are putting on everyone else, actually takes a whole lot of courage. Of course, it’s probably to end your pain and suffering, too, but mostly from experience I’d say it’s driven by a skewed perception of protecting the people you love around you from this all-consuming disease.”', 'The self-preservation instinct is hard-wired and strong, and, as Voltaire understood centuries ago, relevant when it comes to understanding suicidal behavior. Voltaire wrote of the death by suicide of the Roman orator Cato, ""It seems rather absurd to say that Cato slew himself through weakness. None but a strong man can surmount the most powerful instinct of nature."" Centuries earlier still, the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus understood this as well; he wrote that suicide ""is contrary to the instincts shared by all living things."" This view is found as well in Camus\' The Myth of Sisyphus, in which he states, ""The body\'s judgment is as good as the mind\'s, and the body shrinks from annihilation."" The simple but compelling idea that occurred to Voltaire, Josephus, and Camus is that one must first grapple with one of nature\'s strongest forces -- self-preservation -- before one dies by suicide.', 'While feelings of burdensomeness and low belongingness may instill a desire for suicide, they are not sufficient to ensure that desire will lead to a suicide attempt. Indeed, in order for this to occur, the theory suggests a third element must be present: the acquired ability for lethal self-injury. This aspect of the theory suggests that suicide entails a fight with self-preservation motives. According to the theory, having fought this battle repeatedly and in different domains instills the capacity to stare down the self-preservation instinct—should an individual develop the desire to.', 'The above discussion brings forth the evolutionary understanding of suicide which mostly focuses on the ultimate function of the act. These theories have explained suicidal behaviors in terms of its benefit to surviving kin (for example, inclusive fitness theory) or as adaptive acts that remove the person from undesirable conditions of survival (for example, bargaining and pain-brain hypothesis). However, critically viewing these theories have raised certain issues which the paper attempts to emphasize in upcoming sections.', ""Getting used to pain, injury, and death -- becoming fearless about it -- is, according to my theory, a prerequisite for serious suicidal behavior. People get used to such things by having repeatedly experienced them, often through previous self-injury, but other painful experiences serve too. A corollary to this view is that the self-preservation drive -- the fear of pain, injury, and death -- protects people from death by suicide (which is why this fear should remain more or less intact). This corollary is supported time and again by cases of people who report that they genuinely desired to die by suicide, but that their bodies would not allow it (e.g., people have cut at their veins for hours, only to eventually surrender to their bodies' ability to clot the wounds).""]"
Are there wild cows?,"Yes, there are wild cows. They include some buffalo, bison and yaks[1], and there are fewer than a dozen species that can be considered cattle still living in the wild, mostly in small and scattered populations[4]. They survive in places like California’s open lands and the Himalayan hillside[5], however their numbers are declining due to hunting for meat and horns and the loss of habitat due to agriculture[5].","['A. Yes, though many of the surviving wild species do not look much like the dairy cows in a Grandma Moses landscape or the herds of beef cattle on a Western ranch.

They also have access to a salt or trace mineral lick.', 'There are cattle, including some that are wild, spread across California’s millions of acres of open lands. But the size of this feral herd and its proximity to one of the most popular wilderness trails in the state make it a vexing problem for federal land managers. Because of a lack of cellphone service in portions of these canyon lands, it wouldn’t be easy to summon help in the event of a stampede or goring.', 'According to wildcattleconservation.org, an educational website that keeps track of the remaining wild species, there are fewer than a dozen species that can be considered cattle still living in the wild, mostly in small and scattered populations.

Do animals go through in the moment emotions such as goosebumps etc?,"Yes, many animals do experience in the moment emotions such as goosebumps. For example, the hair on animals can stand up when they feel threatened, or when they experience positive emotions such as joy or excitement[2]. Studies have also found that goosebumps are a strong but not peak emotional response, and that a combination of goosebumps and tears is the peak level of physiological arousal[3]. Furthermore, scientific research has shown that animals experience emotions such as love, joy, excitement, anger, fear, anxiety, sadness, and depression[4]. Finally, observations of animals across a large number of species have shown marked changes in behavior upon the death of one of their species, which suggests that animals may also experience grief or sadness[5].","['Of course, many lay people (and an increasing number of scientists) will tell you differently. Those who interact with and observe animals on a regular basis can see that dogs, cats, birds, rodents, and even fish do experience basic emotions such as anger, fear, happiness, and sadness, and that more complex emotions, such as jealousy and empathy, are hardly rare.', 'In addition to cold, the hair will also stand up in many animals when they feel threatened--in a cat being attacked by a dog, for example. The elevated hair, together with the arched back and the sideward position the animal often assumes, makes the cat appear bigger in an attempt to make the dog back off. People also tend to experience goosebumps during emotional situations, such as walking down the aisle during their wedding, standing on a podium and listening to a national anthem after winning in sports, or even just watching horror movies on television. Quite often a person may get goosebumps many years after a significant event, just by thinking about the emotions she once experienced, perhaps while listening to the romantic song to which she danced many years ago with the love of her life.', '8Thus our data suggest that goosebumps are although strong, but not peak emotional responses, as unanimously assumed in the pertinent literature. Rather, the very peak levels of physiological arousal are exclusively reached by combinations of goosebumps and tears (goosetears), with a substantial gap between goosetears and goosebumps only. Because, to our knowledge, no study on piloerection and chills collected additional ratings regarding emotional lacrimation, one could speculate that in former studies goosebumps and goosetears were conflated. Critically, the presence of the latter category could have unknowingly amplified the physiological outcomes of the former one.', 'It has been a long-term debate on whether animals have emotions. Anyone loving an animal will usually quickly tell you that yes, they do. Do they feel love, joy, excitement, anger, fear, anxiety, sadness, depression, etc? Recent studies in science have shown that yes, they do.', 'Another commonly hypothesized animal emotion is sadness, or grief. Observations across a large number of species have shown marked changes in behavior upon the death of one of their species. Jane Goodall (1972) observed a young chimp withdraw from his group, stop eating and eventually die after his mother died. Decades later, biologist Marc Bekoff described the collective grief of a herd of elephants, seen standing ""guard over a stillborn baby for days with their heads and ears hanging down, quiet and moving slowly as if they are depressed."" Similar behaviors can be observed in domesticated animals; when one pet dies, the others are often described as acting differently (depressed, disoriented, apathetic, anxious). While many of these vivid examples provide compelling evidence for the existence of animal sadness or grief, further comparative research is needed to continue to learn more about the function and subjective nature of these experiences in animals.']"
How do things like frozen meals or canned soup have so much sodium but not taste too salty?,"Many canned and frozen foods have high levels of sodium because it is used as a preservative to retain flavor[2]. Additionally, some ingredients like broths, condensed soups, spice blends, and meats can also contain a lot of sodium[4]. To reduce the amount of sodium in a soup, one can add more liquid, a dash of vinegar, or a spoonful of sugar[3], as well as rinse canned ingredients before adding them. Additionally, taste the soup as you go and avoid ingredients with too much salt when making homemade soup to get the perfect blend[3][4].","['Some day, try a sodium free meal, like low sodium canned soup. Then compare it to its sodium rich cousin. You will definitely taste the salt. As a society we have become used to meals with high salt content.

Taste as you go and avoid ingredients with too much salt when making homemade soup to get the perfect blend."", 'The easiest way to avoid over-salting your soup is to taste it as you go. Add salt in small increments. Remember, you can always add more if it\'s not enough. Ashley Seelig, Director of Quality Assurance and Product Development at Fischer & Wieser, says you should also be aware of sneaky ingredients. ""Broths and condensed soups are notorious for being salty,"" she says. She warns that many spice blends contain added salt, too. Be sure to read the labels of your ingredients. You may also have to avoid adding salt if you\'re cooking with sodium-filled meats like ham or bacon.', '- If you are cooking with canned foods, like beans, try rinsing them before adding them in. They are preserved with salt and rinsing them first can reduce the amount of sodium you add into the soup.']"
how can college students go on strike? can't their teachers just fail them?,"College students can go on strike by collectively refusing to do labor for their university, such as stopping in-person and online classes, refusing to answer emails, not holding office hours, not doing committee work, and other forms of labor[4]. Additionally, students can show their support for the strike through virtual events like teach-ins, happy hours, and concerts[4]. Although there is some controversy surrounding this, some universities have allowed students to access services such as the library during strikes[5].","[""Because of the nature of collective bargaining, students pretty much have no say in what goes on during negotiations. That's pretty wack considering the hefty financial investment at stake. There are residual effects to strikes that can affect a student's entire semester. Lost time means your professors are rushing through material when they get back.

These issues affect students too, and learning about how labor works within their university is valuable.We will have messages prepared for students so they know why we are striking and how they can show their support.', 'Students often take pride in their own schools, but a strike can turn those feelings around real quick. A student who normally loves his or her school can be quick to lose trust in its ability to run a fiscally responsible and fair institution. Unfortunately, many students decide to transfer schools in lieu of enduring the strike.', 'A: Our strike will be visible in many ways. First, obviously classes taught in real time will be halted. For classes taught asynchronously, we can take our materials down from the course websites. In either form, we can refrain from answering e-mails, holding office hours, doing committee work, or any other kind of labor we usually do during our quarters and semesters. More importantly, we will have many options for coming together online to support one another and be seen by the university community. Teach-ins, virtual happy hours, even mini virtual concerts are among the possibilities. There are even some safe, socially-distanced forms of direct action we are considering. We believe our strike will exert pressure on the administration indirectly by mobilizing students, parents, alumni and directly through the withholding of our labor.', 'Actually, there is a huge controversy about this matter. The actual financial loss of students is not easy to calculate for they still have access to services such as the library normally. And according to the students who university participated in the strike said that, even though some teachers canceled their courses, these professors privately looked for other teachers who did not participate in the strike and remedy lectures.']"
What is fiber and what do our bodies do with it?,"Fiber is the structural part of plant foods--such as fruits, vegetables, and grains--that our bodies cannot digest or break down[1]. It is important for keeping the digestive tract working smoothly, since it passes into the intestine and absorbs water and creates bulk, which helps push waste out of the body[2]. Fiber also plays a major role in digestive health, as it is the fuel the colon cells use to keep them healthy and helps to keep the digestive tract flowing by keeping bowel movements soft and regular[5].

"My father says he can taste the difference between whether I boil the water for his tea over the stove, or, in the microwave (our kettle is bust). Is it possible that the water could taste different due to different boiling methods?","Yes, it is possible that the water could taste different due to different boiling methods. Boiling water in a microwave could lead to a lack of re-aeration of oxygen, which can affect the taste of the tea[1][2][4]. Also, the taste of water heated by different methods such as gas stove, wood stove or electric heater can be different[3]. Furthermore, overheating the water in the microwave can destroy desired aromatic compounds and cause an excess of astringent, bitter notes in the tea[5].","['My hypothesis was to see if I noticed a difference in the taste of tea due to the method of boiling water affecting the possible reaeration of oxygen in water. I believe that I will not notice a taste difference in tea in which the water had been boiled in a microwave versus boiled in a tea kettle. I do, however, think that I will notice a difference in the taste of tea using water that was previously boiled, left to cool for 7 hours and then re-boiled. I think the tea made from previously boiled water will taste flat, have a thin mouthfeel and have little flavor profile.', 'Does the method of boiling water affect the taste of tea due to a possible lack of re-aeration of oxygen in the water? I am guilty of boiling water in a microwave and boiling water in a kettle, forgetting about it, only to boil the water later for a cup of tea. Is there really a difference?

Eventually I have not used it for more than 2 years, since the taste of water is not ideal.', 'I enjoyed conducting my tea experiment and was surprised to find that my three cups of Darjeeling tea did not taste the same. There could be several reasons for this. One of the reasons could be that I over-boiled the microwave water to make sure the middle of the water reached a boiling temperature, thus causing the Darjeeling to be inadvertently over-steeped. Secondly, the microwaved and re-boiled water may not have successfully re-aerated. To me, all boiled water, being equal in water type, is not the same boiled water. I noticed a difference in my cups of tea.', 'Overheated water results in bad tea, too—and this is also easier to do in a microwave than in a kettle, since there’s no mechanism to indicate when the water has reached a boil. The longer water boils, the more dissolved oxygen it loses—and tea experts say that dissolved oxygen is crucial for a bright and refreshing brew. Microwaved water can also be taken to several degrees above boiling if heated for too long (which is impossible in a kettle, because the metallic surface prevents overheating). Such ultra-hot water destroys desired aromatic compounds and elicits an excess of astringent, bitter notes by overcooking the leaves. Overheated water can also accentuate naturally occurring impurities in the water that contribute off flavors to the final brew.']"
Can animals experience music emotionally like we can?,"Research suggests that animals can experience music emotionally like we can. For example, horses can synchronize their pace to the rhythm of music playing in the background, as can sea lions and bonobos[4]. Additionally, exposure to string and wind music increases play and tail wagging in pigs, which has been seen as signs of a “positive mood”[5]. Animal welfare scientists are working on ways to use music to improve the welfare of animals in farms[2].","['“It’s a really neat study” that shows animals are more emotionally attuned to music than people think, says Charles Snowdon, a psychologist and animal behavior expert at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who wasn’t involved with the work. “We’ve been trying to argue this for a decade, so it’s nice to see this empirical work support that.”', 'When you cringe at shrieking violins in a horror movie or feel your spirit lifted by a buoyant pop song, you’re doing something scientists have rarely observed in the animal kingdom: having different emotional responses to different types of music. Now, pigs are providing compelling new evidence that animals may respond emotionally to music as well. The find may lead to ways to improve their welfare on farms.', 'Ceballos hopes the study will help researchers create welfare-improving music, tailor-made to a specific species.

Why are humans naturally repulsed by insects?,"Humans naturally repulse insects due to their unusual appearance and attributes which are very different from humans and animals that humans have evolved with, triggering a rejection response[1]. Fear of insects is also closely related to the feeling of disgust, as humans avoid bugs for their potential to make us ill[3]. These reactions are likely evolutionary functions, as early humans did not have easy access to food and their bodies would burn through their fat reserves, eliminating hunger pangs, so they could focus on getting food. Additionally, humans are taught to be careful of insects since childhood, as they can sting, carry diseases, and bite[2]. These messages are often reinforced through chance encounters with insect members of the natural world[2]. Furthermore, insects can evoke panic and loathing, as they can be found in unexpected places.","['The fact that insects have a number of attributes that are very different from humans and animals that humans have evolved with triggers a rejection response. The unusual appearance of insects is the primary factor why people find them so disgusting. Spiders have eight eyes, centipedes have 100 legs, cockroaches have spiny legs which are all very different from us.', 'Those are all fair questions, but what’s crucial to understand is that being “grossed out” by eating bugs, whether they be crickets, grasshoppers, or worms, is purely a mental block. As Scientific American explains, this repulsion is simply the way our bodies have evolved to protects us from perceived dangers, even if the danger isn’t always really there: “We are taught to be careful as children; we are cautioned that wasps will sting us, that flies carry diseases, and that beetles can bite. These messages are often reinforced through chance encounters with insect members of the natural world.”', 'Also, people do not fear certain arthropods, such as spiders, because they pose the same sort of threats as lions and bears. We don\'t think that bugs can overpower and kill us like other larger and aggressive animals. Instead our fear of bugs is closely related to the feeling of disgust. Researchers studying how disgust and fear are related use the term ""rejection response"" to describe the human tendency to keep something unfamiliar, and/or disgusting, far away from us. Much like how we are disgusted by feces and rotting food due to their potential to make us sick, we are also disgusted and avoid bugs for their potential to make us ill. Cockroaches, for example, are one of the most feared arthropods, and for good reason, they are disgusting. It is likely that we find cockroaches more disgusting and fear inspiring than most other bugs because cockroaches actually can spread disease due to their love of rotten food, among other reasons.', 'When you’re relaxing on your porch and a spider suddenly drops on you from above, your natural reaction might be to jump up in panic. Finding a pile of ants congregating in your kitchen or maggots squirming in your fruit bowl are also distasteful and horrifying sights. But why is this? They are living creatures just like a cat or a dog and humans love those, so why are we so disgusted by insects who are also living creatures? As said by the entomologist Jeffrey A. Lockwood, “No one is neutral about insects. A few of us have a debilitating horror about them and a very few of us love them.” There are a few scientific and rational reasons why insects spark a natural and unconscious loathing in us.', 'Why do so many people have a fear of insects? Is it ingrained, or a byproduct of modern culture?

Why do mirrors reflect light?,"Mirrors reflect light because of the material they are made of. Most objects reflect light at varying angles but mirrors reflect light more perfectly[2]. This is because when light hits a mirror, the silver atoms behind the glass absorb the photons of incoming light energy and become excited[5]. In order to become stable again, they give off some more photons and reflect light better than almost anything else[5]. The photons that come out of the mirror are pretty much the same as the ones that go into it[5].","['Thanks for the great question! Mirrors reflect light because of how ""difficult"" it is for light to travel through the material that the mirror is made of. A very common mirror materials is highly-polished silver.', 'A mirror is a surface that reflects light more perfectly than ordinary objects. Most objects reflect light at varying angles. This is more accurately called refraction, because the rays of light bend when they hit the object and move off in varying directions. This allows us to see the object they bounced off of.', 'To understand why mirrors reflect, first think about light in outer space where there is no atmosphere. In outer space light can travel without being reflected, scattered, or impacted by any surrounding atoms or molecules (like mirror atoms or gas molecules). Once light enters the Earth\'s atmosphere, some of the light begins to be impacted by the gas molecules in the Earth\'s atmosphere, but this impact is very small so the light can still keep traveling forward very ""easily"".', 'But why are mirrors uniquely reflective? When light hits a mirror, it reflects every color in the visible spectrum. Most objects absorb some colors and reflect others, giving rise to our perception of the color properties of things. For example, when light hits a banana, it absorbs every color except for yellow, which it reflects, making the banana appear yellow. You might also remember from school that, much like mirrors, white objects (like a piece of printer paper or a white wall) reflect all the colors of the visible spectrum.', ""How does the mirror reflect light? The silver atoms behind the glass absorb the photons of incoming light energy and become excited. But that makes them unstable, so they try to become stable again by getting rid of the extra energy—and they do that by giving off some more photons. (You can read about how atoms take in and give out photons in our article about light.) The back of a mirror is usually covered with some sort of darkly colored, protective material to stop the silver coating from getting scratched, and also to reduce the risk of any light seeping through from behind. Silver reflects light better than almost anything else and that's because it gives off almost as many photons of light as fall on it in the first place. The photons that come out of the mirror are pretty much the same as the ones that go into it.""]"

The process by which an octopus blends in with its environment.,"Octopuses are able to blend in with their environment through a process called camouflage. They can change their color, texture, shape, and even size using special body parts and behaviors to help them survive[1]. An octopus can also use its siphon to rapidly shoot water out of its body and use jet propulsion to flee from predators[1][4]. In addition, students can learn more about the process of camouflage by watching a video of an octopus blending into its surroundings and creating their own ""octopus"" using modeling clay[5].","[""Adaptations are body parts or behaviors that help an animal survive in its environment. An octopus' body is specifically designed to help it capture prey and hide from predators. The arms of an octopus can have 200 suckers, which are used to help the octopus stick onto slick ocean rocks or capture prey. Octopuses can use camouflage, which is when an animal blends into its surroundings. They can change their own color and texture to hide. If they're attacked, they can use poisonous chemicals to hide from predators and kill their prey. As a last resort, they can even lose an arm and later regenerate, meaning regrow it!"", 'Another adaptation of the octopus is the use of camouflage. Camouflage is when an animal blends into its surroundings. The octopus is specifically designed to camouflage itself with color and texture.', 'Octopuses also possess machinery in their skin that helps them to change their texture, which adds another layer to their camouflage. They have tiny bumps called papillae that can be relaxed, making the skin smooth like seaweed, or contracted, making the skin lumpy and rough like a rock. The papillae are also controlled by neural signals from the brain, but this texture-changing process is even less understood than color-changing, Deravi said.', ""Siphon: The siphon can be found near the base of the octopus’s mantle (the round-shaped head/body area.) The siphon is a primary player in the Pacific octopus's respiration. Water flows into the gill slit, goes past the gills, and is ejected out of the tube-shaped siphon.(A video of this can be seen  here. With the use of quick muscular contractions, the octopus is able to rapidly shoot the water out of the siphon. This allows the octopus to zoom away, head-first, using jet propulsion. Under the octopus’s digestive gland is the ink production gland. The ink is produced here, then stored in a larger sac, which is near the siphon. On a command, usually triggered by fear, the octopus releases the ink. Before being squirted out, the ink mixes with mucus. The ink solution is then expelled out of the siphon's opening. This causes the allows the octopus to use jet propulsion and flee in the opposite direction since the attacker is unable to see through the ink."", 'In this lesson, students will learn about camouflage by watching a video of an octopus blend into its surroundings. They will learn about four different characteristics to describe camouflage—texture, shape, color, and size—and will observe and explain how an octopus changes these characteristics in order to camouflage itself.

Boiling a pet crab is safe because crab is not toxic to dogs and can even be a healthy treat in some cases, providing vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids[4]. However, boiling a pet dog is not safe and would be cruel, since dogs can experience adverse reactions to crab, including intestinal parasites, gastrointestinal tract damage, vomiting and diarrhea.

"Why are ""wine pairings"" the way they are? And how are you supposed to drink the wine with your meal?","Wine pairings are the way they are because they are meant to enhance the overall dining experience. The main objective is to have a balanced pairing, where the food and wine are both equally enhanced[2][5]. You should choose a wine that you would want to drink by itself, as well as a food that you enjoy[1]. The weight of the food and the body of the wine should be balanced together, with either the food or the wine as the dominant focus[4][5]. It is also important to consider the sugar, acid, alcohol and tannins of the wine and how they can be accentuated or minimized when paired with certain types of food[4]. To further enhance the pairing, like-with-like flavors can be matched, such as an oaky chardonnay with a cedar-plank salmon dish[3]. The wine should be sipped between bites of food to fully enjoy the experience.[1][2][4]","['Choose a wine that you would want to drink by itself, rather than hoping a food match will improve a wine made in a style you don’t like. That way, even if the pairing isn’t perfect, you will still enjoy what you’re drinking; at worst, you might need a sip of water or bite of bread between the dish and the glass. The same holds true for the food: After all, if you detest liver, there is no wine pairing on Earth that will make it work for you.', 'The main objective to wine pairing with food is to enhance the dining experience. In many cultures winemaking and culinary experiences evolved over many years. Many pairings that are considered ""classics"" today are the result of a region\'s cuisine and wine growing up and merging together in. In Italy one rarely dines without wine and a region\'s wine is known to be ""food friendly"" to match the areas cuisine. Many old wine adages such as ""White wine with fish; Red wine with meat"" are no longer observed.', 'One school of thought thinks that like-with-like is the most pleasant way to pair wine. An oaky chardonnay would pair well with a cedar-plank salmon dish, for example (learn more about the best wine to pair with salmon). Or the cut-grass aroma of sauvignon blanc would pair well with a bean-sprout heavy stir fry.', 'While there are many books, magazines and websites with detailed guidelines on how to pair food and wine, most food and wine experts believe that the most basic element of food and wine pairing is understanding the balance between the ""weight"" of the food and the weight (or body) of the wine. Heavy, robust wines like Cabernet Sauvignon can overwhelm a light, delicate dish like a quiche, while light-bodied wines like Pinot Grigio would be similarly overwhelmed by a hearty stew. Beyond weight, flavors and textures can either be contrasted or complemented. From there a food and wine pairing can also take into consideration the sugar, acid, alcohol and tannins of the wine and how they can be accentuated or minimized when paired with certain types of food.', 'While a perfect balance where both food and wine are equally enhanced is theoretically possible, typically a pairing will have a more enhancing influence on one or the other. Master Sommelier Evan Goldstein notes that food and wine pairing is like two people having a conversation: ""One must listen while the other speaks or the result is a muddle"". This means either the food or the wine will be the dominant focus of the pairing, with the other serving as a complement to enhance the enjoyment of the first. In regards to weight and intensity, if the focus of the pairing is the wine then a more ideal balance will be a food that is slightly lighter in weight to where it will not compete for attention with the wine but not too light to where it is completely overwhelmed. If the focus of the pairing is to highlight a dish then the same thought would apply in pairing a wine.']"
"how does science know what causes cancer, and if they do know, how is any product allowed to contain that ingredient?","Science can use animal and human studies to determine if certain chemicals are linked to cancer. For example, multiple U.S. and international agencies, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' National Toxicology Program, have established that certain chemicals induce cancer in humans or animals[5]. Therefore, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act prohibits the use of any food additive found to induce cancer in humans or animals[5]. Despite this, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has failed to take legally required action on a petition by citizen organizations reminding FDA of its duty to prohibit carcinogenic substances in food[2].

Why do a lot of vegetarians not consider fish a meat?,"Many vegetarians and vegans do not consider fish a meat because they feel that it is distinct from other meats like beef and pork[1].

Additionally, a study found that nearly half of the subjects did not believe that fish were made of meat, which is why they may not consider it a meat[5].","['Rosenfeld and Tomiyama wrote, ”One reason as to why many pescatarians paradoxically consume animal flesh yet consider themselves vegetarian is that they simply do not view fish as meat… We speculate that viewing fish as distinct from other meat may be a strategy for reducing the cognitive dissonance and threats to one’s moral self-concept one might feel from viewing oneself as a meat-eater.”', 'Many vegetarians eat fish, believing that fish is not in the same category as meats like beef or pork (the term for this sect is Pescatarian). However, fish is clearly an animal, and their tasty fillets are made of animal protein... also known as meat. So, is fish meat, or not?', 'Many vegetarians and vegans feel pretty strongly about people who don’t eat meat, but still eat fish. Many contend that fish can feel pain, so you’re not really cutting cruelty out of your life by just sticking to fish.', 'Of course, personal lifestyles also apply in the final verdict. If you ask a vegan or vegetarian, “Is fish meat?” they will likely consider it as such, being one of the foods they avoid. However, if you ask a pescetarian, things would get a little more complicated.', 'Shockingly, nearly half of the subjects (41%) did not believe that fish were made of meat. Further, the pescatarians who denied, for example, that a chunk of raw tuna served in sushi bar is meat were twice as likely to claim they were vegetarians as were pescatarians who did consider fish a type of meat.']"
Why do elephant poachers kill the elephants versus cutting their tusks off and allowing the animals to live?,"Poachers kill elephants instead of cutting their tusks off and allowing them to live because full-grown elephants are large and dangerous and the only way a tusk can be removed without killing the animal is if the animal sheds the tooth on its own[1]. Poachers have to kill elephants to remove the tusks because the tusk is part of the boney skull processes and cutting the tusks shorter would be a logistical task[3]. Additionally, the decades of poaching and constant killing of tusked elephants made being tuskless more advantageous from an evolutionary standpoint in some areas[4], and poaching also takes place within the confines of refuge areas[5].","['This fact is one of the major reasons why poachers kill the elephants.

So elephants stopped growing them During the Mozambican civil war, both sides financed their efforts by poaching elephants for ivory. Now, scientists say that drove some elephants to evolve tusklessness.', 'Elephants tusk removal is also not possible as the tusk is part of the boney skull processes – hence the reason why poachers have to kill elephants to remove the tusks. To cut the tusks shorter would be a logistical task.

In 1993, for example, 1,300 African elephants were found slaughtered with their tusks taken in the Congo's Nouabale-Ndoki National Park.

In the US why is there corn in literally everything?,"Corn is America's super crop and is widely used in many products due to its abundance and affordability[2]. It is found in almost everything from food products to fuel[1][3][4]. This is largely due to the fact that corn is the number one produced crop in America, and is grown in the ""Corn Belt"" which covers a third of the country[1][2]. This is further evidenced by the fact that corn has been a major food staple of Native Americans since the thirteenth century, when it was widely cultivated throughout Mexico and the U.S. Southwest[5]. As Michael Pollan said, “In corn, I think I've found the key to the American food chain”[4], and this is why it is found in so many products.[2]","[""Corn is America's super crop. It's literally everywhere and used in almost everything. The bright yellow stalks we picture coming from corn fields are just the tip of the iceberg in the corn empire. Only 1% of all corn grown, (aka sweet corn), ends up in grocery stores. Some corn found in stores is still on the cob during the right season, but much of it is canned or frozen. The other 99% ends up in our lives in a variety of forms, some of which are unhealthy."", 'There\'s almost no way to avoid it. Corn is the number one produced crop in America due to it\'s demand in many products. The average American doesn\'t realize how much corn they eat in a day. So much corn is produced in the U.S., there\'s a name for it\'s locations. The ""Corn Belt."" This ""belt"" includes the states Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Minnesota, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, South Dakota, Michigan, Missouri, Kansas, and Kentucky. Although the states, together, don\'t look like a ""belt"", it\'s one third of the country that produces a major crop. If scientists were to do DNA tests on the amount of corn an average American eats, verses a Mexican, they\'d think that Americans eat nothing but corn. A major reason it\'s widely used it\'s because it\'s cheap. It\'s a companies ""alternative"" to the ""real stuff.""', 'Corn is not only an important part of our diet but our lives as well.

Why do all young mammals just want to play all the time but lose that interest as they get older,"Young mammals play all the time because play provides an opportunity to perfect survival skills needed later in life, such as hunting, mating, and evading predators[2][3]. Play also helps develop physical and cognitive faculties and provides an environment for experimenting with risk, which helps improve skills and increase versatility of movements[5]. As young mammals age, they start to gain more experience in these skills and become less dependent on playing to practice and perfect them, leading to a decrease in the amount of play they engage in.","['Animals learn the rules of engagement for play at a very young age. Among dogs, the bow is a universal invitation to engage in silliness that triggers the same bowing down and splaying of the front legs in the receiver of the signal—inevitably followed by chasing and pretend biting. Chimpanzees and gorillas motivate others to romp by showing their upper and lower teeth in what primatologists refer to as a play face, which is comparable to human laughter.', 'Scholars of animal behavior recognize three main categories of play. The first is social play, which is any kind of antic that involves others. The second is locomotive play—including running, walking, jumping and pouncing—which facilitates lifelong motor skills. In prey species, locomotive play helps perfect predator-avoidance tactics such as the springbok’s “pronking” high into the air while running as a herd and landing in unpredictable spots. In elephants, it hones predator-avoidance skills, as well as strategies for escaping an aggressive suitor or a competitor looking to inflict a mortal wound. Conversely, young predators such as lion cubs use locomotive play to sharpen their hunting ability. Chasing and tripping littermates and then giving them a good chew on the spine or throat are rehearsals of the skills needed to catch prey animals and dispatch them by severing their spinal cord or choking them.', 'People tend to think of play as an activity one engages in at one’s leisure, outside of learning important skills needed to succeed later in life, such as hunting, mating, and evading predators. But although playing is fun for all involved—and fun for those who are watching—play behaviors evolved as ritualized forms of survival skills needed later in life, providing the opportunity to perfect those skills.', 'I have witnessed the important role of play in calf development and family politics by watching members of my favorite elephant groups frolic at this water hole at sunset. These often chaotic observations inspired me to want to understand more about how animals play and what advantages this behavior might confer, not just to elephants but to all social creatures, including humans. It turns out that play, like other forms of interaction, has rules of engagement. And it is essential for developing the physical and cognitive faculties that animals need to survive and reproduce.', 'Play provides an environment for experimenting with risk. When a lion cub deliberately gives up some control over its body, it puts itself at a disadvantage, allowing others to succeed in pouncing on it. Marc Bekoff of the University of Colorado Boulder and his colleagues have proposed that play increases the versatility of movements used to recover from a loss of balance and enhances the ability of the player to cope with unexpected stressful situations. The goal is not to win but to improve skills, sometimes by self-handicapping.']"
"If 58% of Florida voters voted ""yes"" to medicinal marijuana. Why can't I buy Medicinal marijuana in Florida?","Despite 58% of Florida voters voting ""yes"" to medicinal marijuana, it is still illegal to buy medicinal marijuana in Florida. This is because the ballot amendment required a 60% ""yes"" vote to approve it, and the vote was only 58% in favor[2][4]. The failure to pass the amendment was mostly due to the fact that Florida has the highest percentage of retirees in the country, and the Pew Research Center survey found that just 27% of persons in the Silent Generation were in favor of legalizing marijuana[3]. Furthermore, even if the legislature managed to pass a bill allowing medicinal marijuana, it would not help enough people, so a constitutional amendment is still needed[5].","[""Like SB 1030, HB 63 is for low-THC marijuana only.

We are pushing so very hard to collect the required signatures to place medical marijuana on the 2016 ballot so that Florida voters can once again vote on what our politicians in the state capital refuse to.”"", 'However, another key marijuana vote didn\'t quite go as planned. Floridians cast their ballots on Tuesday to decide whether or not to allow marijuana to be used for medical purposes within the state.

According to a survey from the Pew Research Center, conducted in October, just 27% of persons in the Silent Generation (those aged 69-86) were in favor of legalizing marijuana (in general, not just for medical purposes). This compares to 51% for the Boomer Generation, 54% for Generation X, and 63% for Millennials. Essentially, the younger the focus group, the more support increases.

Why are certain things (eggs and bacon) appealing to eat for breakfast while others are not (cheeseburger),"Certain things, such as eggs and bacon, are appealing to eat for breakfast because of marketing strategies and research done by food companies and food scientists[1]. The power couple of bacon and eggs is also thanks to the science of nutrition, cooking, and a little bit of advertising[2]. Additionally, the influence of public relations played a role in making bacon and eggs the breakfast of choice in the 1920s, when it was promoted as a healthy breakfast option supported by a ""study"" of 4,500 physicians[4]. Today, bacon served for breakfast accounts for 57 percent of all bacon sold in food service and 71 percent of the time, bacon and eggs are eaten together[5]. Cheeseburgers are not typically seen as a breakfast food, as they are not marketed or associated with breakfast the same way eggs and bacon are.","['With the undeniable marked rise in the sales of bacon, eggs, and orange juices, one could not help but respect the marketing strategists behind food publicity of time gone by. From Bernays to McCollum, both moulded America’s belief that breakfast could be healthy too and rebutted that it would not make anyone fat. Americans became more health-conscious and gave credibility to food scientists and research that food companies made. This is still a very common strategy these days. Say Subway, for example, made it popular that fast food could be healthy too. Other fast-food chains also offer plant-based meals, just to provide on the go, convenient choices for individuals who want to stay healthy.', 'Peanut butter and jelly, cookies and cream, burgers and fries, bacon and eggs: perhaps no two other foods have quite the love story as bacon and eggs. Of all American breakfast foods, this flavor combination is likely to result in flavorful memories of meals with the family and even some consumer obsession (think bacon mania). So how did the breakfast power couple come to be? It’s all thanks to the science of nutrition, cooking, and a little bit of advertising. Here’s how their love story unfolded.', 'Did you know that public relations, bacon and eggs all have something in common? You might guess that it’s merely the breakfast of choice for PR folks. Or, it might be that PR people love clever pairings and dissecting word choices. For example, why are eggs plural when there is more than one, but bacon is “bacon,” no matter if it’s one slice or three slices? And, who could even eat just one slice of bacon!', ""In the 1920's Americans typically ate light breakfasts of coffee, orange juice, rolls. In order to increase bacon sales Bernays wrote to 5,000 physicians asking whether a heavy breakfast was better for health than a light breakfast. 4,500 physicians wrote back confirming that a heavy breakfast was better for health as the body is depleted of nutrients after a night of sleep. He had this 'study' published in newspapers across America, conveniently presenting bacon and eggs as the ideal choice."", 'According to the National Pork Board, bacon served for breakfast accounts for 57 percent of all bacon sold in food service and a whopping 71 percent of the time, bacon and eggs are eaten together.

How are government subsidies for food producers different from an indirect food tax?,"Government subsidies for food producers are different from an indirect food tax in that a subsidy is a benefit given by the government to groups or individuals, usually in the form of a cash payment or a tax reduction[5]. Subsidies are meant to lower the cost of acquiring food, increase consumer income, or provide direct access to food[4], while an indirect food tax drives a wedge that increases the price consumers have to pay and decreases the price producers receive[5]. Subsidies can also encourage the consumption of certain foods and discourage the consumption of other foods. For example, subsidies for crops like corn and soybeans keep the prices of many unhealthful foods and beverages artificially low[1].","['Currently, instead of taxing sodas and other unhealthful food, we subsidize them (with, I might note, tax dollars!). Direct subsidies to farmers for crops like corn (used, for example, to make now-ubiquitous high-fructose corn syrup) and soybeans (vegetable oil) keep the prices of many unhealthful foods and beverages artificially low. There are indirect subsidies as well, because prices of junk foods don’t reflect the costs of repairing our health and the environment.', '- ➔ In many countries, fiscal subsidies to agricultural producers have increased the availability and reduced the price of staple foods and their derivates (e.g. low-cost foods of minimal or no nutritional value). As a result, the consumption and diversity of unsubsidized or less subsidized commodities such as fruits, vegetables and pulses, have been discouraged as they are relatively more expensive.', 'Direct subsidies involve cash transfers or tax breaks that immediately impact a company or industry. Indirect subsidies do not have a specific cash value or involve payments of cash. These can instead include making it easier to obtain inputs or reducing costs in other ways.', 'Fiscal subsidies to consumers are budgetary transfers from the government (and more specifically taxpayers) to intermediary (e.g. processors, traders, etc.) or final consumers of food. These transfers are meant to lower the cost of acquiring food (food subsidies), to increase consumer income (e.g. cash transfers) or to provide direct access to food (e.g. in-kind food transfers and school feeding programmes).', 'While a tax drives a wedge that increases the price consumers have to pay and decreases the price producers receive, a subsidy does the opposite. A subsidy is a benefit given by the government to groups or individuals, usually in the form of a cash payment or a tax reduction. A subsidy is often given to remove some type of burden, and it is often considered to be in the overall interest of the public. In economic terms, a subsidy drives a wedge, decreasing the price consumers pay and increasing the price producers receive, with the government incurring an expense.']"
Would lab grown meat eliminate the risk of certain diseases?,"Yes, lab grown meat could potentially eliminate the risk of certain diseases. Lab-grown meat is safe from zoonotic diseases[2][5], is produced in a highly controlled environment which can protect the meat from microbes and contamination[3][5], and is produced without the use of antibiotics or pesticides[5]. Additionally, it can be altered to contain healthy fats such as omega-3 fatty acids[4], which help reduce inflammation and the risk of heart diseases.[4][5]","['In addition to being antibiotic-free and safe from zoonotic diseases, lab-grown meat has immense health benefits. Scientists have suggested the possibility of altering the nutritional contents of cultured meat according to the necessary requirements. This type of meat is often called designer meat.', 'Another consequence the lab-grown meat evades is that of zoonotic diseases. Livestock grown in confined spaces are susceptible to outbreaks such as influenza. Lab-grown meat is safe from these zoonotic diseases plaguing the animals and the antibiotics that are given to them.', 'Additionally, lab-grown meat is produced in a highly controlled environment which can protect the meat from microbes and contamination. E. coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter are intestinal pathogens that cause illnesses every year and are a concern for meat-eaters. As there are no intestinal organs in the lab-grown meat, there can not be contamination during slaughter.', 'Additionally, unhealthy fats in meat can be replaced with healthy and essential fats such as omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids help reduce inflammation and the risk of heart diseases. Laboratory meat producers may also be able to add vitamins like B12 into the cultured meat. If scientists are able to produce meat in which macro and micronutrients can be altered according to the need of the human body, the potential health benefits of lab-grown meat are endless.', 'One of the growing reasons lab-grown meat is beneficial for society is that it can be produced in a controlled environment without the use of antibiotics or pesticides. Hannah Tait, the communications assistant at Mosa Meat, one of the leading companies in the lab-grown meat industry, has highlighted the importance of cultured meat in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, as lab-grown meat carries fewer health risks than traditional animal products. In addition, reducing the number of animals in the food supply will promote human health and reduce the likelihood of zoonotic diseases. Zoonotic diseases are caused by germs transmitted between animals and humans. COVID-19 is speculated to be of a zoonotic origin; it was most likely transferred from a bat to another animal, which made direct contact with a human.']"
Why does rubbing alcohol evaporates so quickly and are the fumes heavier or lighter than air?,"Rubbing alcohol consists mainly of ethanol or isopropanol, which have weaker attractive interactions between the liquid molecules than water molecules, meaning they evaporate faster[1]. Isopropyl alcohol is flammable, so it should be kept away from all flames and handled with care[3]. Also, it can be evaporated away by pouring the alcohol/resin solution into a wide dish and placing it in a warm room next to an open window with a ventilation fan blowing over the dish towards the window, pushing the alcohol fumes safely outside[4]. The fumes are lighter than air.","['Thank you for the question. Rubbing alcohol consists mainly of ethanol or isopropanol. Ethanol and isopropanol boil at a lower temperature than water, which generally means that they will evaporate quicker than water. The boiling temperature is largely determined by attractive interactions between the liquid molecules. The attraction between 2 ethanol molecules is weaker than the attraction between 2 water molecules, which means that the water molecules do not want to be separated like they would in a vapor or gas upon evaporation. Water molecules attract each other strongly because each molecule participates in 4 attractive ""hydrogen bonds,"" which are bonds between the hydrogen of one water molecule and the oxygen of another water molecule. Ethanol and isopropanol each only participate in 2 hydrogen bonds.', 'Temperature isn’t the only thing that affects evaporation. The type of liquid matters too. You can try an experiment to see if alcohol or water is the faster evaporator.', 'Isopropyl “rubbing” alcohol (see the second part of this activity, “What else could you try”) is flammable and may irritate your skin and eyes. Keep it away from all flames. Always work with an adult to supervise and guide you. You and your adult partner should both wear properly fitting safety goggles. Wear gloves when pouring isopropyl alcohol.', ""Hi, thanks for your comment and question. There's no way to safely vacuum purge your extraction without the proper equipment, I'm afraid. You can still do a rudimentary purge and evaporate the alcohol away by pouring the alcohol/resin solution into a wide silicone or pyrex dish (silicone makes it easier to collect up afterwards) and place it in a warm room next to an open window with a ventilation fan blowing over the dish towards the window, pushing the alcohol fumes safely outside. You may want to cover the dish with a fine mesh (mosquito netting or cheesecloth/muslin) to stop anything falling into it (dust, insects etc.). This will evaporate most of the alcohol away, but not 100%, it also will result in some loss of terpenes and hence less flavour in the final product. For this reason, a vacuum pump and chamber are preferable, as we can purge the solvent at a lower temperature, retaining a greater terpene content. I hope that helps, best wishes and happy extracting!"", 'I take issue with the statement in this article ""It should also be said that isopropyl alcohol contains more toxic substances than pure ethanol (which actually shouldn’t contain any)"" First of all, Pure Ethanol is very expensive and very difficult to make. I have 99.9 percent pure isopropyl. It is hard to find ethanol that pure. Furthermore, the process of making ethanol creates many more nasty chemicals than does the making of isopropyl. Everclear in particular is super dirty. Talk about carcinogenic chemicals. The levels of Acetone, Methanol and Fusel Alcohols are super high in Everclear. You can smell it. It is awful. If your temperatures are not above 153 when purging, then these nasties will accumulate and concentrate in your final product.

Why can't we domesticate some animals such as tigers and lions as pets?,"It is not possible to domesticate some animals such as tigers and lions as pets due to biological and evolutionary differences between our domestic cats and dogs and wild tigers, lions, monkeys, and reptiles[2]. Also, big cats like lions were too wild to domesticate, and there was probably no use for them since feeding them would be too expensive and capturing them and training them would also require certain provisions, time, and the willingness to overcome the dangers of such contact[3]. Even if humans did try to domesticate lions through selective breeding, such an experiment would take a dedicated group of specialists and generations of lions and probably humans to truly see if such a thing is possible[5]. Moreover, all wild animals should be able to live in the wild, and domesticating wild animals is nothing more than self-gratification[4].","['Domestication is a long process and it can’t be applied to an individual animal, but to the whole species. This means that one big cat, whether it’s a lion, a tiger, or a puma cannot be domesticated, but a group of lions, tigers, and pumas could be domesticated by humans after generations of selective breeding.', 'On the flip side, the consequences of taking free animals out of their natural habitat (especially animals like tigers and lions that are endangered) and forcing them to live in a cage in our backyards as pets is equally devastating. There are many biological and evolutionary differences between our domestic cats and dogs and wild tigers, lions, monkeys, and reptiles. We need to respect the fact that just because humans can hand-rear lion cubs does not mean that they will lose their heightened adrenal glands that drive them to hunt, or that their perfectly evolved teeth and claws will cease to be a threat.', 'In most cases, animal domestication was the product of human intervention. Plant and animal domestication happened in numerous places, most likely about 11,700 years ago, and in some parts of the world before 15,000 years ago. While there were many animals that became useful to humans, big cats like lions were too wild to domesticate and there was probably no use for them. Feeding them would be too expensive and capturing them and training them would also require certain provisions, time, and the willingness to overcome the dangers of such contact.', 'There is an indisputable difference between owning a dog or cat and confining a lion or tiger to a captive life. All wild animals should be able to live, well, in the wild. Thousands of years ago wild animals were domesticated out of necessity, and despite many failed attempts by exotic pet owners to prove otherwise, domesticating wild animals at this junction is nothing more than self-gratification. Our energy and our focus should be on the conservation and survival of a species—particularly of endangered species—not on attempts to domesticate those that cannot be.', 'While Captive Asian elephants were used as transport and believed to be domesticated by some they never were, similarly, big cats that were also bred in captivity were never selectively bred.

In reality, such an experiment would take a dedicated group of specialists and generations of lions and probably humans to truly see if such a thing is possible.']"
why does petting dogs and other animals reduce stress?,"Petting dogs and other animals can reduce stress because it provides physical touch, which builds trust and reduces stress and gives the immune system a boost[1].

Why do domesticated animals appear to be more loving towards humans than they are with other animals?,"There are several reasons why domesticated animals appear to be more loving towards humans than they are with other animals. One is that the emotional connection between pets and their owners is worthy of cross-cultural attention and dogs are able to read emotional cues from the faces of their owners and to respond accordingly[1]. Another reason is that humans have more compassion for animals who are suffering than for adult humans in similar circumstances, treating the hurt dogs akin to helpless infants who need protection[1]. This can also relate to the human-animal bond many of us feel, as they require our attention, help, and concern[2]. Additionally, a study revealed that people who love animals have a specific version of the gene that produces the love hormone oxytocin, which is important for empathy between humans and boosts social bonding[3]. Psychologists explain that our attitude towards animals is influenced by many possible contributing factors, such as socio-cultural norms, religious beliefs, personality traits, and early life experiences[5], and researchers also suggest that compassion for animals may be linked to genetic differences[5].","['Regardless of the reasons for domestication, the emotional connection between pets and their owners is worthy of cross-cultural attention.

how does crushing ivory deter poachers or how is it helpful?,"Crushing ivory serves as a deterrent to poachers and traffickers by showing that governments and conservation groups are actively trying to suppress the illegal ivory trade[5]. It also encourages other governments to destroy their own stockpiles and tighten anti-trafficking measures[1]. However, it is important to note that crushing ivory can also lead to the loss of priceless forensic data that could be used to prosecute poachers and can lead to increased demand for ivory around the world which can result in more poaching[3][4].

How does animal/plant create some of the most potent poison out of nothing?,"Many plants and fungi produce their own toxins as a form of defense against predators and parasites. These toxins can be powerful and are chemically diverse, and can include substances that affect heart muscle and blood pressure, cell poisons that inhibit protein synthesis, hormone-like compounds, hallucinogenic chemicals, irritants, blistering agents, photosensitizers, and plant allergens[4]. Animals may also build up resistance to certain poisons by being exposed to small quantities first[1]. Additionally, some plants contain toxic agents that, when eaten, render the animal sensitive to strong sunlight and cause damage ranging from sunburning to blindness[5].","[""Animal factors also influence the ability of plants to poison. Different animal species are susceptible to different plants and poisons. The age of the animal is also important. Young animals are often more susceptible than older ones, but it isn't always the case. Animals may build up resistance to certain poisons by being exposed to small quantities at first. Then, if a large quantity is consumed, they are resistant because their metabolism has already adjusted to handle the poison.

If so, then genetics might help explain why a love of animals is something some people just don’t get.', ""We know that most people buy exotic pets because they love animals. Animals bring joy to our lives, so why wouldn't we want them to be a part of our lives every day at home? Sadly, the truth is any wild animal that finds itself caught in the exotic pet trade experiences suffering."", 'There’s a final twist to this story: recent studies have shown that affection for pets goes hand-in-hand with concern for the natural world. It seems that people can be roughly divided into those that feel little affinity for animals or the environment, and those who are predisposed to delight in both, adopting pet-keeping as one of the few available outlets in today’s urbanised society.', 'Archer, J.

How do they make fake flavours for candy/chips and that sort of stuff?,"Artificial flavors are created by combining natural and synthetic chemicals, which are then blended to create a particular flavor. These chemicals are often made to mimic natural flavors, and they're used to enhance or alter the taste of foods, such as candy, chips, and other snacks. Some of these artificial flavors may have adverse health effects, such as diacetyl, which has been linked to Alzheimer's disease[4]. Other artificial flavors can be more unusual, such as ""sweet cheese"" potato chips, which combine both feta and cheddar cheese with sweetened condensed milk[5].","['You might at first glance think these are just regular banana chips made out of bananas, like the ones you find in the bulk aisle at the health food store. But no, these are banana flavored potato chips from South Korea. Opening the bag is like being punched in the face with banana Laffy Taffy. They’re salty-sweet and made from potato flakes, so they have a great puffed, flakey texture. But fake banana is a divisive artificial flavor, and anyone who hates it will hate these chips.', ""These waffle-shaped chips from South Korea are made from wheat, but are as crisp and airy in texture as a rice cracker. These aren’t particularly salty—they're straight up glazed with with a shiny, fake maple and cinnamon-flavored coating. But they’re not crazy sweet, either, thanks to the distinctly fried taste of the chip itself. All in all, the taste may remind you of diner pancakes, French Toast Crunch, or, more than anything, the smell of a doughnut shop. In a good way."", 'Elsewhere in the world, snack manufacturers have created all kinds of delicious and sometimes bizarre chips that can double as dessert.', 'An artificial flavor called diacetyl, which is used to flavor microwave popcorn and is also used in potato and corn chips and crackers, has been linked to Alzheimer’s disease. Other possible symptoms include nausea, dizziness, headaches, fatigue and seizures. Without labeling the specific ingredients in artificial flavors, identifying the root cause of your symptom(s) can be nearly impossible.', 'And then there’s the bizarre “sweet cheese” potato chip—again from South Korea—which is exactly what it claims to be. This one is less like cheesecake and more like someone mixed flavor powder for cheddar cheese chips with sweetened condensed milk. It takes some getting used to, but these chips really aren’t so terrible. They look and feel exactly like your average Lay’s potato chip, and the funky cheese flavor (which actually comes from both feta and cheddar cheese) takes a backseat to the milky flavor, balancing sweet and salty in a way you’ve probably never tasted before. Worth a try if you find them in a store, but probably not worth getting shipped from Korea.']"
Do animals make friends with other animals? For example: would a migrating animal stop by and visit an old friend on the migration journey?,"Yes, animals do make friends with other animals. Research has identified a few species that are capable of forming true friendships, including the higher primates, members of the horse family, elephants, cetaceans, and camelids[1]. Anthropologist Barbara King has also documented a number of animals, ranging from dogs to hippos to apes, forming bonds with animals of another species[2]. These friendships can even form in captivity[1][3] and with domesticated animals[2][4][5], as well as between humans and non-domesticated animals[4][5]. Migration is a long and difficult journey, so it is possible that an animal may stop by and visit an old friend on the way.","['MOST animals have acquaintances but only a few species are capable of true friendship. This select group of mammals includes the higher primates, members of the horse family, elephants, cetaceans and camelids. It is no coincidence that all of these animals live in stable, bonded social groups. Group living has its benefits, but it can also be stressful and you cannot simply leave when the going gets tough – which is where friendship comes in. Friends form defensive coalitions that keep everyone else just far enough away, without driving them off completely.', 'Anthropologist Barbara King from the College of William & Mary says she and other scientists have documented a number of animals, ranging from dogs to hippos to apes, that make bonds with animals of another species. If one dies, the survivor grieves. An elephant named Tarra was close to a dog named Bella and grieved after Bella was killed by coyotes. King says she has also been moved by the relationship between Owen the hippo and a 100-year-old tortoise named Mzee. “In this friendship that formed over years, they worked out a system of cross-species communications,” says King. In some cases, the biggest risk in cross-species friendships isn’t getting eaten. It’s emotional loss.', 'Strong attachments often arise in captive animals, says Bonnie Beaver of Texas A&M’s College of Veterinary Medicine. “Two very stressed individuals may lean on each other for comfort.” In most cases, cross-species friendships are forged most strongly when animals are young. But in captivity even an older captured animal might seek out a friend, including a member of another species.', 'In the previous 11,000 years, humans have brought a wide range of species into domestication to use as livestock, working animals, household pets, and companions. The influence of human behaviour on domesticated animals has led to many species having learned to co-exist - sometimes leading to the formation of an interspecies friendship. For example, interspecies friendships are often observed in humans with their domesticated pets and in pets that live in the same household such as cats and dogs.', 'Interspecies friendships have been displayed between humans and non-domesticated animals.

How come we can't mechanically cool the ocean to help combat global warming?,"It is not possible to mechanically cool the ocean to help combat global warming because the ocean absorbs over 90% of the heat and CO2 that we release into the atmosphere[1][2]. The top few meters of the ocean store as much heat as Earth's entire atmosphere, and more than 90% of the global warming is going into the ocean[3][4]. Additionally, it takes a lot of energy to raise the temperature of water and the process of exchanging energy between the surface layers and the deep sea can be slow[4]. The ocean acts as a buffer and if we didn't have it, the planet would be about 100 degrees hotter now, which would make it inhospitable[5].","['When we burn fossil fuels (like oil, gas, or coal) to power our homes, businesses, and cars, we are adding the gas carbon dioxide to the air. The blanket of carbon dioxide we\'ve been building for over a hundred years acts like a greenhouse, trapping more of the sun\'s heat. More heat means a warmer ocean, which is taking its toll on marine life. It also causes the ocean to become more acidic, which makes it hard for organisms like corals and clams to build their skeletons and shells. You can help slow global warming and ocean acidification by reducing your ""carbon footprint""—the amount of carbon dioxide released as you go about your daily activities.', 'Ocean health is something that worries him every day. What many fail to realize, he said, is how connected what we do above ground is to what’s happening beneath the waves. Take, for instance, greenhouse gas emissions.

What is the history of Britain's involvement in India?,"Britain's involvement in India dates back to the 18th century, when British merchants established trading posts along the coast[1]. In the 1750s, the British began to wage war on land in eastern and south-eastern India, and by the end of the century had consolidated their military dominance over most of the Indian subcontinent[1]. During World War I, India sent 1.4 million soldiers to fight alongside the British, and this helped to raise India's international profile, leading to calls for greater self-governance[4]. During World War II, Britain borrowed heavily from India and accumulated large sterling reserves, which were eventually split between India and Pakistan when they became independent in 1947[3]. Finally, the legacy of British colonialism in India has been called into question in recent years, as evidenced by books such as Shashi Tharoor's ""An Era of Darkness: the British Empire in India"" which challenges the notion of a beneficent British colonialism. In addition, a comprehensive overview of Britain's role in India during the 20th century can be found in Judith M. Brown's article ""India"" in the Oxford History of the British Empire.","['British involvement in India during the 18th century can be divided into two phases, one ending and the other beginning at mid-century. In the first half of the century, the British were a trading presence at certain points along the coast; from the 1750s they began to wage war on land in eastern and south-eastern India and to reap the reward of successful warfare, which was the exercise of political power, notably over the rich province of Bengal. By the end of the century British rule had been consolidated over the first conquests and it was being extended up the Ganges valley to Delhi and over most of the peninsula of southern India. By then the British had established a military dominance that would enable them in the next fifty years to subdue all the remaining Indian states of any consequence, either conquering them or forcing their rulers to become subordinate allies.', 'As Britain struggles with Brexit, and evokes “imperial nostalgia”, Shashi Tharoor’s book, “An Era of Darkness: the British Empire in India”, demolishes at least three common myths. First, the myth of the beneficence of British colonialism. Then there is the notion that 18th century England was a promising model of democratic governance.', ""Britain borrowed everywhere it could and made heavy purchases of equipment and supplies in India during the war. Previously India owed Britain large sums; now it was reversed. Britain's sterling balances around the world amounted to £3.4 billion in 1945; India's share was £1.3 billion (equivalent to $US 74 billion in 2016 dollars.) In this way the Raj treasury accumulated very large sterling reserves of British pounds that was owed to it by the British treasury. However, Britain treated this as a long-term loan with no interest and no specified repayment date. Just when the money would be made available by London was an issue, for the British treasury was nearly empty by 1945. India's balances totalled to Rs. 17.24 billion in March 1946; of that sum Rs. 15.12 billion [£1.134 billion] was split between India and Pakistan when they became independent in August 1947. They finally got the money and India spent all its share by 1957; mostly buying back British owned assets in India."", 'World War I would prove to be a watershed in the imperial relationship between Britain and India. 1.4 million Indian and British soldiers of the British Indian Army would take part in the war and their participation would have a wider cultural fallout: news of Indian soldiers fighting and dying with British soldiers, as well as soldiers from dominions like Canada,Australia and New Zealand, would travel to distant corners of the world both in newsprint and by the new medium of the radio. India\'s international profile would thereby rise and would continue to rise during the 1920s. It was to lead, among other things, to India, under its own name, becoming a founding member of the League of Nations in 1920 and participating, under the name, ""Les Indes Anglaises"" (The British Indies), in the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp.

can a methane digesting bacteria be the solution to the releasing of methane in the waters?,"Yes, methane-digesting bacteria could potentially be a solution to the release of methane in the waters.

Heterotrophic bacteria isolated from Lake Matano were recently shown to utilize a diverse array of phosphorus sources and to make large changes in the RNA content and lipid composition of the cells when phosphorus starved[5]. The metagenomic data set from the surface water of Lake Matano also shows that all of the genes necessary for cleavage of phosphonate to methane and phosphate are present[5].

What does it mean when a reef has bleached? And what does that mean for the future of our Oceans?,"Coral bleaching is when corals lose their vibrant colors and turn white because they expel the microscopic algae called zooxanthellae that live in a mutually beneficial relationship with the coral[3]. It is a result of ocean environment changes, such as when the water gets too hot[3]. Over the past seven years, our Reef has suffered four severe mass coral bleaching events, faster and more severe than scientists predicted[1]. Around 75% of the world’s tropical coral reefs have experienced heat-stress severe enough to trigger bleaching[4], and for 30% of the world’s reefs, that heat-stress was enough to kill coral[4]. It can take decades for coral reefs to fully recover from a bleaching event[5], and if we continue burning fossil fuels at our current rate then severe bleaching events are likely to hit reefs annually by the middle of the century[5], which would be devastating for coral reefs as they would have no chance to recover.[5]","['In just seven years, our Reef has suffered four severe mass coral bleaching events, faster and more severe than scientists predicted.

On the other side of the continent, the world famous Ningaloo Reef Marine Park also showed signs of bleaching.', 'Coral bleaching happens when corals lose their vibrant colors and turn white. But there’s a lot more to it than that. Coral are bright and colorful because of microscopic algae called zooxanthellae. The zooxanthellae live within the coral in a mutually beneficial relationship, each helping the other survive. But when the ocean environment changes—if it gets too hot, for instance—the coral stresses out and expels the algae. As the algae leaves, the coral fades until it looks like it’s been bleached. If the temperature stays high, the coral won’t let the algae back, and the coral will die.', 'Bleaching also matters because it’s not an isolated phenomenon.

Why does Asian cuisine rarely contain dairy?,"There are several reasons why Asian cuisine rarely contains dairy. One is that many people in Asian cultures avoid eating anything with a dairy product, so they don't see the necessity to include much cheese in their cooking[1]. Another is that dairy just isn't popular in traditional Chinese or Asian cooking in general, and many Asians are lactose intolerant due to not continuing to drink milk after childhood[2]. Another factor is that Chinese, Japanese and Southeast Asian cultures have the highest rates of lactose intolerance in the world, which could explain the lack of dairy in their cuisines[3]. Additionally, Asians have historically avoided dairy products due to lactose intolerance[5].","['Since many people in Asian cultures avoid eating anything with a dairy product, they don’t see the necessity to include much cheese in their cooking. And that is why most asian recipes don’t contain cheese.', '2. Dairy just isn’t that popular in traditional Chinese or Asian cooking in general. It just didn’t catch on.

"ELI5: Why is it that herbivores such as cows are easily able to eat their afterbirths, even though they never habitually consume flesh? Could you feed your cow a carniverous diet?","Herbivores such as cows are able to eat their afterbirths for several reasons. Hunger, predator avoidance, and instinct are all possible reasons for why cows eat their placentas[1]. Cows are not well-suited to consuming meat due to the lack of upper incisors, so the process is awkward[2]. It is possible that some cows may give up sooner than others due to difficulty chewing[3]. Additionally, some herbivores like giraffes have adapted a diet that is able to handle the afterbirth without getting sick or having indigestion. Additionally, it is not likely that cows eat their placenta as a means of bonding with their calf, as the placenta is generally not in contact with the calf and removing the placenta causes the cow to return her attention to her calf[5]. Therefore, it is not recommended to feed your cow a carnivorous diet.","['So, why do cows eat their placenta? By eliminating bonding as a possible reason we have narrowed it down to three main theories; hunger, predator avoidance, and instinct. Each has its own appeal and all seem equally probable not only as a reason for cows but also for why other mammals eat their placenta. Suffice it to say that some combination of hunger, predator avoidance, and instinct drives cows to partake of the afterbirth snack.', 'Cows are inconsistent placentophages. Many cows don’t touch it at all, some chew on it for a while. I’ve never directly observed a cow eat the entire placenta, but occasionally the placenta is missing the next morning so I assume that unless an opportunistic coyote, dog, or vulture has stolen it, the cow has eaten the whole thing. Ruminants aren’t well suited to consuming meat, so the process is awkward. They do a lot of chewing and slurping. Since they don’t have upper incisors, they can’t take a good bite. Other herbivores with upper and lower teeth (rabbits, horses, etc.) might be better at it. Back when we raised rabbits, the does would always clean up the placentas promptly and completely. After licking and gumming it for a while, cows seem to satiate whatever unknown instincts drive them to do so, and then they leave it alone.', 'Hi Kristy, no the cows don’t always eat the placenta. I can’t give you a percentage with any certainty, but I have often found placentas left behind in the field. And it is possible that some of the placentas that I don’t find have been eaten by coyotes or vultures after the cow and her calf walk away. I don’t know the prevalence of placentophagy for other herbivores. For your other question about how much is left behind, that also varies. Cattle aren’t equipped with upper incisors, so eating something spongy must be difficult and maybe some cows give up sooner than others. Herbivores with complete upper teeth like horses and rabbits would have an easier time of it.', ""I know they do it to help mask the scent of birth, but I've always wondered how strict herbivores, like Giraffes or something, are able to just eat up all of the afterbirth and not get sick or even have indigestion."", 'The idea that a cow eats her placenta as a means of bonding with her calf can probably be rejected. The placenta is released a few minutes to a few hours after the calf is born and it is not usually in contact with the calf. The idea of bonding may have arisen from confusing amniotic fluid which the newborn calf is covered in with the placenta. “Most cows will pay attention to the calf while eating their placenta”, says Murray Warnke, a beef cattle producer from Wetaskiwin, AB. “But some become focused on the placenta and ignore the calf.” In these cases, removing the placenta causes the cow to return her attention to her calf. This, in conjunction with the fact that the placenta is generally not in contact with the calf, opposes the idea of bonding as a reason for cows to eat their placenta.']"

EL5: Why do companies such as Mcdonald's and Walmart continue to spend so much on advertising when they are already the most popular companies in the world?,"Companies such as McDonald's and Walmart continue to spend so much on advertising because they want to maintain their current customer base and reach out to new customers. They also want to ensure that their brand is seen as the top choice for customers. Additionally, McDonald's may be spending more on advertising to make up for operational, execution, and pricing issues in certain parts of the US[2]. Furthermore, these companies may be spending more on advertising to increase their investors' fortunes, rather than looking after their employees properly[3].

Why are some skins on fruit and veg edible while others aren't?,"The skins of some fruits and vegetables are edible while others are not. Fruits and vegetables with edible skins include potatoes, yams, sweet potatoes, squash, beetroot, bell peppers, parsnips, eggplants, cucumbers, carrots, apples, berries, citrus fruits, cherries, kiwi, apricots, grapes, peaches, pears, and plums[1]. Inedible peels include melons, pineapples, lychee, papayas, mangos, and banana peels[2]. Although onion and garlic skins are also inedible, they make a great addition to stocks. Avocado skins are considered inedible, but contain healthy dark flesh just under the skin[2]. Mango skins contain a toxin called urushiol which can cause inflammation and digestive issues[2]. Some skins are not only edible, but also nutrient-dense, such as kiwi skin[3] and apple skin[1][2][3][4][5]. The skins or peels of fruits and vegetables are jam-packed with beneficial nutrients, dietary fiber, and protective antioxidants that are needed for good health and disease prevention[5].","['Most fruit and vegetable skins are edible and can be easily incorporated into meals. Potatoes (only avoid eating them if the skin is green), yams and sweet potatoes, squash, beetroot, bell peppers, parsnips, eggplants, cucumbers, carrots, apples, berries, citrus fruits (cooked or zested), cherries, kiwi, apricots, grapes, peaches, pears, and plums, all have edible skins.', 'However, some fruit and vegetable peels are tough and difficult to digest, even when they’re cooked. These inedible peels should be removed and put in the compost. These include melons, pineapples, lychee, papayas, mangos, and banana peels. While onion and garlic skins are also inedible, they make a great addition to stocks. Avocado skins are also considered inedible, but when you’re peeling off an avocado skin, make sure you don’t excise the healthy dark flesh that’s just under the skin—this part is loaded with beta-carotene, antioxidants, and vitamins B12 and E. While mango skins aren’t considered dangerous to eat, their skins can be bitter, and they contain a toxin called urushiol (the same compound found in poison ivy) that can cause inflammation and digestive issues.', 'While we\'re used to cooking and using skins from foods like citrus fruits — such as lemons, limes, and oranges — there are many other varieties of produce that have delicious skins too. For example, kiwi skin is a source of fiber, vitamin E, and folate. ""While some people may not mind eating it with the fresh kiwi itself, blending it into a smoothie makes the most sense,"" says Jones. You can easily chop the kiwi and keep the skin on, but also don\'t be afraid to take a bite into it like you would an apple.', 'Apples are one of the fruits Cecere is most adamant about not peeling. “Apple skin has insoluble fibre, vitamin C, vitamin A and the flavonoid quercetin,” she says. Although apple skins contain so many nutrients and fibre, they are a higher pesticide fruit. So make sure you wash them well or consider buying organic apples.', 'The skin or peels of fruits and vegetables are jam-packed with beneficial nutrients, dietary fiber, and protective antioxidants that are needed for good health and disease prevention. Unpeeled fruits and vegetables contain significantly higher levels of these nutrients compared to when they’re peeled. For example, when you peel an apple, you’re throwing away half of the apple’s beneficial fiber content. Enjoying an apple with the skin on will also provide you with 31% more vitamin C, 60% more vitamin A, and a whooping 300% more vitamin K than a peeled apple (1).']"
why is blood pressure an important health metric? And how does sodium affect it?,"Blood pressure is an important health metric because it is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke[1][4]. Sodium plays an important role in controlling blood pressure, as it pulls water into the bloodstream and increases the volume of blood in the blood vessels, leading to an increase in blood pressure[3]. High sodium intake can lead to higher levels of blood pressure, and the World Health Organisation recommends reducing sodium intake to less than 2.4 g a day to prevent high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease[4]. Additionally, studies have shown that high sodium intake can increase blood pressure variability, which can be associated with end-organ damage and cardiovascular morbidity[5].","['The body needs a small amount of sodium to function, but most Americans consume too much sodium. High sodium consumption can raise blood pressure, and high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke.1 Most of the sodium we consume is in the form of salt.', 'Sodium is essential for cellular homeostasis and physiological function. Excess dietary sodium has been linked to elevations in blood pressure (BP). Salt sensitivity of BP varies widely, but certain subgroups tend to be more salt sensitive. The mechanisms underlying sodium-induced increases in BP are not completely understood but may involve alterations in renal function, fluid volume, fluid-regulatory hormones, the vasculature, cardiac function, and the autonomic nervous system. Recent pre-clinical and clinical data support that even in the absence of an increase in BP, excess dietary sodium can adversely affect target organs, including the blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and brain. In this review, the investigators review these issues and the epidemiological research relating dietary sodium to BP and cardiovascular health outcomes, addressing recent controversies. They also provide information and strategies for reducing dietary sodium.', 'Access sodium in your bloodstream pulls water into your blood vessels, increasing the amount (volume) of blood inside them. When more blood flows through your blood vessels, blood pressure increases. It’s like turning up the water supply to a garden hose — the pressure in the hose increases as more water is blasted through it. Increased blood flow also makes the heart work harder to pump more blood through the body.', 'High blood pressure is a leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which caused at least 17.8 million deaths worldwide in 2017.1 A higher intake of dietary sodium is associated with a higher level of blood pressure in animals and humans.234 The physiological requirement for sodium in humans is less than 1 g a day,5 but currently most populations consume a much higher level.6 The maximum daily intake of dietary sodium recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) is 2 g (5 g salt) for adults,7 and most countries recommend reducing intake to less than 2.4 g a day89 as part of a dietary approach to prevent high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease.', 'Background:  High sodium (Na+) intake augments blood pressure variability (BPV) in normotensive rodents, without changes in resting blood pressure (BP). Augmented BPV is associated with end-organ damage and cardiovascular morbidity. It is unknown if changes in dietary Na+ influence BPV in humans. We tested the hypothesis that high Na+ feeding would augment BPV in healthy adults.']"
Why does the federal government ban the use of growth hormones in pork  &  poultry but not in beef  &  sheep?,"The federal government bans the use of growth hormones in pork and poultry but not in beef and sheep because growth hormones are not permitted for use in cows that produce milk, but are allowed in beef and dairy cattle[1], and for some uses in pork[1][3][5].

How does animal agriculture (particularly cows) contribute to a bad environment?,"Animal agriculture, particularly cows, contributes to a bad environment in multiple ways. Cows are farmed in conditions that are detrimental to the air, water, habitat, and soil[5], and their farming results in greenhouse gases, such as methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide, that warm the Earth's atmosphere and contribute to climate change[4]. The effects of climate change include cycles of extreme weather, harm to ecosystems, and the acidification of the ocean due to warmer waters[4].","['While cows as a species are not inherently bad for the environment, the way that industrial farmers raise cows for food and other commercial purposes has harmed the environment. The immediate environment in which cows are farmed includes their barns, grazing pastures, milking parlors, and feedlots, and extends to ecosystems on local, regional, and planetary levels. This article will focus on the broader environmental impact of cattle farming on non-cows.', 'The current narrative about animal agriculture says that ruminant livestock animals (e.g., beef cattle, dairy cattle, etc.) produce methane. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. Thus, animal agriculture is bad for the environment.', 'Cows are victims in institutions that seek to knock them down. For the most part, they are objects to be slaughtered, milked, marinated, grilled, and worn. The conditions in which cows are farmed in North America are bad for the environment, though cows themselves are merely surviving those conditions as source materials for Ben and Jerry’s ice cream and beef jerky, among other products of today’s food systems.', 'The way cows are farmed results in greenhouse gases that warm the earth’s atmosphere, contributing to sustained changes in the weather known as climate change. The effects of climate change include cycles of extreme weather like floods, excessive rain, and droughts. Climate change is also resulting in harm to ecosystems, such as the acidification of the ocean due to warmer waters. Greenhouse gases released as a result of cow farming include methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide.', 'With increasing attention to the impacts of climate change, cattle farming is increasingly coming under fire. The conditions in which cows are farmed—from clearing land to cultivate corn to the feedlot and the slaughterhouse—are detrimental to the air, water, habitat, and soil. Even while putting aside the specific welfare of cows as their bodies are exploited for human consumption, the living conditions of all beings on Earth are threatened by the increasing demand for cow products. The political push to curb climate change requires reforming food and energy supply chains sprung from centuries of entrenched business practices.']"
Why is organic / less processed peanut butter so much soupier and more oily than processed skippy or jif?,"Processed skippy or jif peanut butter is so much soupier and more oily than organic / less processed peanut butter because they contain hydrogenated vegetable oils (such as rapeseed, soybean, and cottonseed oils) to prevent the natural separation that occurs in natural peanut butters[1]. Additionally, conventional nuts and peanuts are known to be heavily treated with synthetic pesticides and fungicides, while organic peanut butter means that the peanuts were grown on a farm that limits the use of pesticides[4][5]. Furthermore, all the other ingredients in the peanut butter must be organically grown to achieve that title[5].","['They also contain hydrogenated vegetable oils to prevent the natural separation that you see when you enjoy natural peanut butters that are free from these oils. SKIPPY contains a blend of rapeseed, soybean, and cottonseed oils, while Jif only uses rapeseed and soybean oils.

It’s very important to choose organic nut butter because conventional nuts and peanuts are known to be heavily treated with synthetic pesticides and fungicides. Especially when it comes to peanuts because they are a legume (not technically a nut) and their pods grow underground, which allows pesticides to be more readily absorbed and concentrated. Couple that with the fact that peanuts are often rotated with cottonseed crops (1) (the world’s most pesticide-ridden crop) and you’ve got a breeding ground for massive pesticide contamination. (2)', 'To start with, organic peanut butter means that the peanuts were grown on a farm that limits the use of pesticides, especially synthetic pesticides or fertilizers. The farms must also work to promote healthy ecological balance and biodiversity.

Why do animals lick to show affection?,"Animals lick to show affection because it is a learned behavior, similar to the way puppies lick their mothers to show hunger and affection[3]. Licking is also a ritualized greeting between pack members in some wild species[5]. Cats may also lick humans as a sign of affection when they are petted[4].","['Do dogs lick to show affection? The answer is an absolute yes! This is one of the most common reasons that domestic dogs lick their human friends.

The answer is both yes and no. Yes, licks often indicate affection because your dog has learned the behavior: you like or appreciate the licks and thus give your dog snuggles or praise in return. So to make you happy, the dog will lick more. Even more basic to dog behavior is that licking is often a way that puppies communicate to their mothers that they’re ready to eat. So a dog may lick you to indicate hunger, be treated with a dog biscuit, and thus learn that licks make for a happy owner who gives out food.', 'Cats can also lick humans as a sign of affection, if their owner pets them they want to return the favour and do this by licking.', 'But, there is also evidence that licking is sometimes a sign of affection. Horowitz points out that, although it started as a food-seeking behavior, licking has now become a ritualized greeting for many dogs. Some wild species in the dog family will lick pack members just to welcome them home. So, those daily slobbers really might just be a sign that your dog is happy to see you.']"
How did they measure the nutritional facts in every pack of snacks,"The nutritional facts in every pack of snacks were measured using a combination of bomb calorimetry and food factors[1][5]. In a subset of the snacks, macronutrient content was specifically measured by comparing the total difference in grams and the difference from the label in percentage[2][4]. This was done by first determining the serving size of the snack food by the amount of food given on the nutrition label, and then adding a variable amount of water to the sample to make an evenly distributed slurry[5]. The sample was then frozen at -20 °C and underwent lyophilization at -77°C. After completion of the drying process, the samples were weighed and 1 g pellets were produced with a pellet press[5].","['This report investigates the accuracy of label-stated caloric contents of energy-dense snack food products in the United States.

Furthermore, food lots and retail stores were not randomly sampled and therefore our data are based on the assumption that nutrient content and serving size may not vary by distribution lot or retail location. Finally, macronutrient content was measured in a small convenience sample of the tested snacks but not all products.', 'One serving size was determined by the amount of food as given on the nutrition label, for example: crackers, chips or packages and not by weight. This food weight was measured and compared to serving size weight on the nutrition label. Then for preparation for bomb calorimetry a variable amount of water (between 50 and 200 g) was added to the sample to make an evenly distributed slurry. To further ensure homogeneity, samples with a high amount of nut content were soaked in water for 24 hours prior to processing.

"If humans as a race prevented all those with genetically related physical or psychological shortcomings from reproducing, in several generations would there be a marked improvement in the overall health of mankind?","No, it is unlikely that preventing those with genetically related physical or psychological shortcomings from reproducing would lead to a marked improvement in the overall health of mankind in several generations. While it is true that many people try to improve themselves in various ways, such as diet, exercise, education, cosmetics, and plastic surgery, attempts at eugenics through technology are largely seen as morally abhorrent[3]. Additionally, there is no scientific basis to the claim that the biological evolution of mankind has stopped[4]. Furthermore, even minor enhancements may end up doing more harm than good, such as creating an even wider gap between the haves and have-nots and leading to new kinds of exploitation or even slavery[5].","['Enhancing humans is still in the future, but the basic argument in favor of doing so is that it could make life better in significant ways by enhancing certain characteristics of people. We value intelligence, beauty, strength, endurance, and certain personality characteristics and behavioral tendencies, and if these traits were found to be due to a genetic component we could enhance people by giving them such features. Advocates of genetic engineering point out that many people try to improve themselves in these ways already – by diet, exercise, education, cosmetics, and even plastic surgery. People try to do these things for themselves, and parents try to provide these things for their children. If exercising to improve strength, agility, and overall fitness is a worthwhile goal, and if someone is praised for pursuing education to increase their mental capabilities, then why would it not be worthwhile to accomplish this through genetics?', 'The Nobel laureate geneticist H. J. Muller eloquently voiced this concern about the cure, whether through genetic therapy or traditional medical treatment, of genetic ailments. “The more sick people we now cure and allow them to reproduce, the more there will be to cure in the future.” The fate toward which mankind is drifting is painted by Muller in somber colors. “The amount of genetically caused impairment suffered by the average individual…must by that time have grown….[P]eople’s time and energy…would be devoted chiefly to the effort to live carefully, to spare and to prop up their own feebleness, to soothe their inner disharmonies and, in general, to doctor themselves as effectively as possible. For everyone would be an invalid, with his own special familial twists….” (ref. 29; Fig. 1).', '- Genetic engineering is a version of eugenics and evokes memories of the historical eugenics movement of the earlier part of the twentieth century in America and Nazi Germany. “Eugenics” is the view that we should improve the genetics of the human race; often advocated are such practices as selective breeding, forced sterilization of “defectives” and “undesirables” (people with genetic disorders or undesirable characteristics or traits, people with disabilities, people of other races, people of other ethnic groups, homosexuals), and euthanasia of such populations. It probably reached an extreme form in Nazi Germany, where mass exterminations took place, but eugenics sentiments existed prior to that in the U.S. These practices are now largely viewed as morally abhorrent. Critics of genetic engineering see it as an attempt at eugenics through technology.', 'There is no scientific basis to the claim sometimes made that the biological evolution of mankind has stopped, or nearly so, at least in technologically advanced countries. It is asserted that the progress of medicine, hygiene, and nutrition have largely eliminated death before middle age; that is, most people live beyond reproductive age, after which death is inconsequential for natural selection. That mankind continues to evolve biologically can be shown because the necessary and sufficient conditions for biological evolution persist. These conditions are genetic variability and differential reproduction. There is a wealth of genetic variation in mankind. With the trivial exception of identical twins, developed from a single fertilized egg, no two people who live now, lived in the past, or will live in the future, are likely to be genetically identical. Much of this variation is relevant to natural selection (5, 8, 9).', 'Even minor enhancements, critics say, may end up doing more harm than good. For instance, they contend, those with enhancements may lack empathy and compassion for those who have not chosen or cannot afford these new technologies.

Why can't we splice the genes from plants for chlorophyll into humans and then we'd never need to eat again?,"It would be impossible to splice the genes from plants for chlorophyll into humans and never need to eat again[1]. Chloroplasts, which are the organelles responsible for photosynthesis, contain their own DNA which is separate from the plant's primary genome[3][4].

Therefore, splicing the genes from plants for chlorophyll into humans would not work.[1]","[""ELI5: Why can't we splice the genes from plants for chlorophyll into humans and then we'd never need to eat again?"", '""If you were to put a human gene into a plant, (it) could read the DNA and translate it into a protein, but this is totally ridiculous that just putting your saliva on the seed can somehow change its DNA to feed you better,"" Maureen Hanson, a molecular biologist and professor of molecular biology and genetics at Cornell University, told USA TODAY.', 'There isn’t a single gene for photosynthesis, which is the process plants use to produce glucose from the Sun’s energy. Plants can photosynthesise because their cells contain chloroplasts, which were originally free-living bacteria that entered into a symbiotic relationship with single-celled organisms about 1.5 billion years ago. Chloroplasts have their own DNA and reproduce inside plant cells, but they also need the plant to provide the right environment.', 'Because ""having chlorophyll"" is only one tiny step in the process of photosynthesis. And that is leaving aside the fact that plant cells themselves don\'t have it in their genomes - photosynthesis is done by organelles called chloroplasts, which have their own DNA, separate from the plant\'s primary genome. The list of problems here is way longer than that, though.', 'Could humans mimic our thieving friends, Elysia chlorotica, and photosynthesize instead of always having to eat with our mouths? To get chloroplasts to work in humans, we would have to make some big assumptions. The first assumption is that human skin cells would be capable of supporting the chloroplasts. This support would require our immune system to not reject them and that melanin (the pigment that gives skin its color) would not interfere with chloroplasts’ functions. Beyond this, the chloroplasts would need to survive and be functional, but the Elysia chlorotica system shows it is possible.']"
What real reason is there for us to save the giant panda?,"There are several reasons why we should save the giant panda. One is that all forms and levels of life must be respected and protected[1], and not allowing the extinction of any species is an ethical imperative. Another reason is that saving the giant panda is not a lost cause or a waste of time[1][2]. We should also save the giant panda because we are the ones that have driven it to the edge of extinction and have the power to save it[1][3]. Lastly, saving the giant panda also helps to protect other species that live in the same environment, such as dwarf blue sheep and beautiful multi-coloured pheasants, and promotes ecological health and stability[5].","['Finally, there are arguments for not allowing the extinction of any species based on who we are and what our relationship is with all forms of life with whom we share the planet. Imagine if we worked to construct a conservation motive that was as powerful and ingrained as the profit motive; worked to shape an ethical imperative that says all forms and levels of life must be respected and protected; and, that terms like carrying capacity and sustainability and the web of life and interdependence would be as common in school curricula as the Battle of Hastings and the discovery of penicillin. Then the question of why save the Giant Panda would become how can we save the Giant Panda?', 'Many have argued that the amount of public attention the giant panda receives overshadows other species that would be easier to save. While it is true there are many worthy causes within wildlife and environmental conversation, it’s simply not true that saving the giant panda is a lost cause or a waste of time.', 'We should do everything we can to save the giant panda because we are the ones that have driven it to the edge of extinction. And because we can.', 'If the Giant Panda were ugly, really ugly, I think there would be less commotion about letting the species die out. The “adorable factor,” which pushes many to want the species preserved, while helpful to the general cause, is oft times an impediment to the central arguments for preservation. Those arguments are based on a few concepts that have been proved to be powerful and critically important. One is that diversity promotes stability; The other is that interdependence is the touchstone for ecological health and well being.', 'So by saving pandas, we will also be saving so much more.

How are cats and dogs universal pets in every culture?,"Cats and dogs are universal pets in every culture because they are the most common types of pets found in all cultures around the world[1][3]. They are also seen as important companions, with many societies attaching spiritual meanings to them[1]. Furthermore, people interact with them in different ways, from using them for specific purposes such as hunting or herding to playing with them and letting them live inside the house. Lastly, people tend to develop strong bonds with them, considering them to be full members of their families and doting on them emotionally and financially[5].","['Gray and Young (2011) conducted a broad cross-cultural study of human–pet dynamics around the world utilizing the Probability Sample Files, a stratified random sample of 60 culturally, linguistically, and geographically diverse societies represented in eHRAF World Cultures. Their study revealed that “dogs, birds, and cats were the most common pets, followed by horses, other hoofed mammals such as water buffalo, rodents, nonhuman primates, and pigs” (ibid. 23). The authors suggest various reasons that peoples around the world keep pets, including rearing the animals for food, training them for assistance with hunting or labor needs, or keeping them as playful companions for children. Attitudes and sentiments towards the domesticated animals vary, with many societies attaching spiritual meaning to their birds, cats, or dogs that “illustrate the ways in which pets may be woven into the broader belief system of a society” (ibid. 26).', 'While the keeping of domestic pets appears to be overwhelmingly common, what makes an animal a suitable pet – and one worthy of great adoration and pampering by their human owners – can vary across cultures.

While it’s true that most human cultures have pets in their home, the way they interact with them is remarkably variable. Herzog cites a study published in 2011 comparing pet-keeping practices in 60 societies around the world. The study found a large variety of species of pets, including some that seem quite odd from a Western perspective: ostriches, tortoises, bears, bats.

The study’s general conclusion, as Herzog puts it: “The affection and resources lavished upon pets in the United States and Europe today is a cultural anomaly.”', 'If the number of cute animal memes on the internet is a fair benchmark, then the human love of pets is a powerful and global phenomenon. For many pet owners, their furry (or scaly) domestic companions transcend any simple categorization of non-human animal.

are wildlife parks cruel to animals and if so why and how?,"Yes, wildlife parks can be cruel to animals. Animals can be killed simply for not having the right genes or if the park has bred too many and cannot house them all[1], and they can be swapped with other zoos[2]. Although the enclosures in wildlife parks are larger than traditional zoos, they are still restricted spaces, and animals are kept captive against their will[2]. Additionally, animals in safari parks are there for our “entertainment,” and not for their own benefit[3]. Animals in safari parks are also subject to other forms of cruelty, such as being kept in unnatural habitats and being forced to perform for the entertainment of visitors.","['As in all zoos, killing healthy animals is deemed an acceptable management tool in safari parks. Animals can be killed simply for not having the right genes or if the zoo has bred too many and cannot house them all.', 'First things first…. Safari parks in the UK are still zoos.

Though certainly not perfect, it could have been worse. Unlike a circus where animals are kept in very unnatural habitats, and are there solely for our “entertainment,” and, clearly, NOT for their own, many of these animal parks and refuges are there for the animals’ sake, and not for ours. Our ability to visit and see these animals is a privilege, and allows us to learn about them and, hopefully, appreciate them. They are not meant to entertain us.', 'Sharing my experience with you is not meant to convince you about the merits of wildlife parks, but will hopefully get you thinking, as it did me. Before this visit, I was not a real fan, but I can see that the argument for having them is a bit convincing.', 'These are just some of the examples of how safari parks are just as bad as traditional zoos.

"One pair of Beats cost $400 and Nike shoes $200, so how does cheap labor in overseas sweatshops make these items any ""cheaper""?","By outsourcing the production of their items to countries where labor is cheap, companies like Nike are able to make a large profit margin. For example, it costs Nike just $1.50 to produce a shoe that will be sold for $150 in the US[1]. New Balance on the other hand, produces their shoes in the US, and they are often more expensive. The difference in wages between Nike and New Balance is significant too, as Nike pays workers in countries like Vietnam just $500 a year while New Balance pays their workers $15,200 more a year[5]. This helps to make Nike's products cheaper than New Balance's, even though the labor costs for Nike are lower.","['Critics say that Nike is aware of these conditions for a long time and are clearly not controlling its contractors, turning a blind eye to these abuses for one simple reason: profit. In Vietnam, it costs Nike $1.50 dollars to produce a shoe that will be sold for $150 dollars in the US. This is because the average worker earns around $42 a month, or $500 a year. Compared to the paycheck of the Nike CEO, the inequality is shocking grotesque. As Clair (2008) states: “Knight, who owns 100 million shares of Nike stock, pulls in roughly $80 million in dividend payments each fiscal quarter.

How do food companies know exactly how much calories/protein/fibre etc is in their product?,"Food companies use the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA) to calculate the amount of calories/protein/fibre etc in their product. The NLEA requires that the Calorie level placed on a packaged food be calculated from food components, usually using the Atwater system, which adds up the calories provided by the energy-containing nutrients: protein, carbohydrate, fat and alcohol, and subtracts the fiber component from the total carbohydrate before calculating the calories[2]. The FDA allows for a 20% discrepancy in food labeling[3], which is why some products may have different labels in different countries. Additionally, companies may use the formula: Grams of protein x 4 + grams of fat x 9 + grams of total carbohydrates - grams of fiber x 4 to calculate the calories in their product[3][5].","[""I for one, really appreciate having the calories info--I can and do calculate using my specific ingredients when I make something but when I am choosing what to make I like to have a ballpark figure at least. It is an interesting topic because in Canada companies can't subtract the fibre so sometimes the same product is labelled as one calorie/carb count here and the exact same product has different info in the U.S."", 'The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA) currently dictates what information is presented on food labels. The NLEA requires that the Calorie level placed on a packaged food be calculated from food components. According to the National Data Lab (NDL), most of the calorie values in the USDA and industry food tables are based on an indirect calorie estimation made using the so-called Atwater system. In this system, calories are not determined directly by burning the foods. Instead, the total caloric value is calculated by adding up the calories provided by the energy-containing nutrients: protein, carbohydrate, fat and alcohol. Because carbohydrates contain some fiber that is not digested and utilized by the body, the fiber component is usually subtracted from the total carbohydrate before calculating the calories.', 'Let’s try it again: Grams of protein x 4 (8) + grams of carb x 4 (100) + grams of fat x 9 (9) = 117 calories. Hmm. That’s way off from the stated 60! Why is Fiber One allowed to say that? The FDA allows for a 20% discrepancy in food labeling, but this is much farther off than 20%. What gives?', ""That is an excellent question, Sydney! My guess would be is that because the FDA hasn't taken a stance on it and there are still various arguments on how fiber is digested, the companies have decided to stick to the traditional route. The food industry knows that they can't just randomly switch up the calories on everything without serious questioning from calorie-conscious buyers who have memorized or can research the typical amount of calories in a product. This situation is similar to how America still uses the imperial system instead of the metric system that the majority of the world measures with-many just think it's too much of a hassle to switch over! Hope that this helps:-)"", 'And now for your first application of your new favorite formula. Please contain your enthusiasm and hold your thunderous applause until the end. Grams of protein x 4 (8) + grams of fat x 9 (9) + grams of total carbohydrates – grams of fiber x 4 (44) = 61 calories (rounded down to 60 on the label). Whoa. Considering we thought the exact same serving of the exact same product had 117 calories just a minute ago, this is big. Huge.']"
Why does red meat turn brown when it gets cooked?,"Red meat turns brown when it gets cooked because the myoglobin in the meat is exposed to oxygen, which causes the iron atoms in myoglobin to lose an electron and go to a +3 oxidation level[1][4][5]. This produces a chemical called metmyoglobin, which is the cause of the characteristic brown coloration of meat[2][4]. Meat can also turn brown if it is kept in the refrigerator for more than a week, which is caused by chemical changes in the myoglobin[3]. Meat is not dyed red when it is sold in stores, as this is due to the myoglobin molecule being bound to oxygen[1][3][4][5].","['So how does the myoglobin end up making the meat turn brown when cooked? This darkening effect is due to the oxidation state of the iron atoms in myoglobin. When the myoglobin is exposed to oxygen, before you cook the meat, the iron atom oxidation level is +2 and it is bound to a dioxygen molecule (O2), which makes the meat appear bright red. As you cook the meat, this iron atom loses an electron and goes to a +3 oxidation level with this process ending up turning the meat brown.', 'There are many reasons that meat can turn brown. Cooking meat at a high temperature browns meat because of the maillard reaction. As meat ages it turns brown from oxidation. The oxidation process is a result of the bound iron molecule in myoglobin going from the ferrous to ferric form. This produces what is called metmyoglobin. Metmyoglobin is the cause of the characteristic brown coloration of meat that occurs as it ages.', '- When red meat is kept in the refrigerator for more than about a week, it will typically start to turn brown as well; similar to when you cook it, this is also due to chemical changes in the myoglobin. This doesn’t necessarily mean it has gone bad though. Typically a quick sniff will tell you if it’s still good or gone bad at that point.', 'So we’ve established once meat turns brown, it’s hard for it to turn back to that red color. One myth I see commonly brought up is that old meat is dyed red. This is not anything any of us in the meat industry have heard of nor have we found information to supply this so-called practice. Since we are dealing with an enzymatic reaction here, I don’t think any dye could possibly work as effectively as the reaction itself. When you see red meat in the grocery store, it’s because it is a. actually fresh and b. allowed oxygen to keep it that red color.', 'Meat is red when the pigment myoglobin that is contained in blood is bound to oxygen. Myoglobin is related to hemoglobin, which is the iron- and oxygen-binding protein in blood, specifically in the red blood cells. When oxygen is released from myoglobin there is a change in spectral properties of the myoglobin molecule. The result is a brownish color. The images above show two pieces of grass fed meat that were unprocessed. One was left exposed to the air and the other was vacuumed packed prior to cooking using the sous vide method. The strong vacuum pulled out air and drew oxygen molecules off the surface of the meat. Removing the meat from the bag showed that only the surface level turned brown.']"
Why is it that exploration instruments get crushed passed a certain limit from water pressure yet deep sea organisms can survive?,"Deep sea organisms can survive because they have special adaptations to resist sudden pressure changes and live under constant pressure[3]. Additionally, they don't have air pockets that would expand as pressure drops during retrieval, and their biomolecules are adapted to work properly in high pressure[1]. Exploration instruments, on the other hand, get crushed because water does not compress the same way air does, so the pressure exerted on the instrument would cause it to collapse. Additionally, high pressure can distort complex biomolecules, which is why food companies use high pressure to sterilize their products[5].","['Animals brought from great depth to the surface in nets and submersible sample boxes generally die; in the case of some (but not most) deep-sea fishes, their gas-filled swim bladder (adapted to resist high pressure) expands to a deadly size. However, the vast majority of deep-sea life has no air pockets that would expand as pressure drops during retrieval. Instead, it is thought that rapid pressure as well as temperature changes kill them because their biomolecules no longer work well (high TMAO does not help, as it appears to be too high in deep-sea life for biomolecules to work properly at the surface). Advances in deep sea technology are now enabling scientists to collect species samples in chambers under pressure so that they reach the surface for study in good condition.', 'Everything in the deep ocean is under a great deal of pressure. At any depth in the ocean, the weight of the water above pushes on any object below it. With every foot an object descends into the ocean, more water is pushing down and against it, and more pressure is exerted upon that object. In fact, for every 10 meters traveled deeper into the ocean, there are an additional 6.47kg (14.27lbs) of pressure on each square inch of surface. In order to descend to greater ocean depths, scientists and explorers must use specially designed equipment like remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and manned submersibles that can operate under extreme pressures. How extreme? An ROV diving to a depth of 2,000m experiences over 1,270kg (2,800lbs) of force exerted on each square inch of its surface!', ""Deep-diving marine mammals have special adaptations to resist sudden pressure changes. Depth dwellers have adaptations to live under constant pressure. Human beings are bound by our physiology and technology. Past depths of about 99 feet -- 4 atmospheres of pressure -- reinforced atmospheric suits are necessary. These allow the person inside to experience a single atmosphere of pressure up to depths of around 2000 feet. Exploration from about 2000 feet to the ocean's maximum of 36,200 feet requires special equipment, predominantly unmanned. The challenges involved in getting down there mean the ocean's depths -- 60 per cent of Earth's ecosystem -- are still largely unknown."", ""One reason you couldn't withstand the pressure of the ocean's depths without serious protection is the difference in volume between pressurized air and pressurized water. Molecules in air are spread out -- you can squish them together quite a bit without making the air in a given space weigh very much more. Water doesn't squish -- a cubic foot of liquid water always weighs 64 pounds, and 64 pounds of liquid water always takes up one cubic foot of space. Deep water would squeeze the air in your body, especially in your sinuses and lungs. Since air is compressible, these spaces would eventually collapse."", 'Considering the volume of water above the deepest parts of the ocean, it’s no wonder that hydrostatic pressure is one of the most important environmental factors affecting deep sea life. Pressure increases 1 atmosphere (atm) for each 10 m in depth. The deep sea varies in depth from 200 m to about 11,000 m, therefore pressure ranges from 20 atm to more than 1,100 atm. High pressures can cause air pockets, such as in fish swim bladders, to be crushed, but it does not compress water itself very much. Instead, high pressure distorts complex biomolecules — especially membranes and proteins — upon which all life depends. Indeed, many food companies now use high pressure to sterilize their products such as packaged meats.']"
"When we call or write our representatives in congress, what incentive do they have to listen to us instead of just doing what they wanted to do in the first place?","Congress representatives have an incentive to listen to constituents because it is part of their job to help constituents solve problems and address their concerns. Furthermore, constituents who call or write with specific issues or requests are more likely to be taken seriously than those who just express their political preferences. Former Representative Vin Weber (R-MN) also noted that Congressmen would be motivated to solve problems, not create them, if they knew they would not be around to micromanage the bureaucracy due to term limits[4]. Finally, letters and electronic communications are listened to and read by Congress representatives[5].","['Bureaucratically speaking, those are some of the most irritating words on the planet. But, politically speaking, they are the start of a tantalizing sentence: Due to an unusually high call volume, what? At present, an enormous number of people are calling their political representatives, not always to obvious effect. So what difference does it really make in the minds of lawmakers—and, more to the point, on the floors of the House and the Senate—when large numbers of everyday people start contacting Congress?', 'Likewise, phone calls that hew to scripts from advocacy organizations usually get downgraded, especially if the caller seems ill-informed about the issue. Such calls also tend to annoy staffers. “You could tell when you walked in the office by how the staff was responding that they were getting the same call over and over,” Josiah Bonner, a former Republican congressman from Alabama, said. (Jo Bonner, as he is known, was the victim of one of the few recurring errors made by the congressional operators, a result of having served in the House at the same time as John Boehner. “Not infrequently, I’d pick up the phone,” he told me, “and someone would say, ‘I’d like to tell the Speaker to go straight to hell.’ And I’d say, ‘Well, I’ll be sure to get him the message.’ ”)', 'Such oddities aside, most communications to Congress fall into one of two categories. In the first, known as constituent services, callers have a specific problem with a federal agency and want their senator or representative to help solve it: by securing an honor guard for a veteran’s funeral, resolving a filing issue with the Social Security Administration, nominating an aspiring cadet to West Point, obtaining political asylum for an imperilled relative, or helping out with an overseas adoption. The second category, conversely, might be called constituent demands: someone calls and expresses a political preference to anyone who answers the phone and hopes that his or her legislator will act on it. It is a curious thing about Americans that we simultaneously believe nothing gets done in Congress and have faith that this strategy works.', 'As former Representative Vin Weber (R-MN) has noted, ""We create the government that screws you, and then you\'re supposed to thank us for protecting you from it."" Under term limits, Members of Congress would be motivated to solve problems, not create them. If Congressmen know they will not be around to micromanage the bureaucracy, they will be more careful about the powers they delegate. Term-limited Congressmen would have every reason to work for major reforms that transfer responsibility away from bureaucrats and back to Congress. Instead of transferring power among branches, term limits are likely to result in overall restraints on government activity.', 'Unlike call volume, the data on mail sent to Congress is public, and it suggests that, at least among the politically active, the U.S. Postal Service remains popular; the Senate alone received more than 6.4 million letters last year. Contrary to popular opinion, those written communications are an effective way of communicating with Congress, as are their electronic kin. “Everything is read, every call and voice mail is listened to,” Isaiah Akin, the deputy legislative director for Oregon’s Senator Ron Wyden, told me. “We don’t discriminate when it comes to phone versus e-mail versus letter.”']"
Do animals from different countries have different 'languages'?,"Research suggests that the overwhelming majority of animals are born knowing how to speak their species’ “language” and it does not matter where they are born or raised[3]. However, there is some evidence that some animal species have something similar to regional accents or dialects[3]. For example, sperm whales in the Caribbean use a different clicking pattern to those in the Pacific and Ornithologists can immediately identify a white-crowned sparrow’s place of birth from its song[3]. So, animals from different countries may have some different “languages” or dialects, but they are still able to communicate with each other using noises, gestures, and symbols[5].","['Obviously, humans have hundreds of different languages spoken all over the world. Are we the only ones though? The Washington Post  released an article about a study done with macaques (a type of monkey) where they took babies from one regions macaques and switched them with another regions. They found that the macaques didn’t learn they customs or cultures in the new settings, even when being raised by a different regions macaques parents. This lead to the conclusion that an animals ability to communicate is completely within its genes, and is not able to adapt and learn a different “language” so to speak. (University of Pennsylvania psychologists and biologists findings).', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/do-animals-from-geographically-distant-areas-speak-the-same-language/2012/06/25/gJQARLYJ2V_story.html', 'According to an article in the Washington Post “research suggests that the overwhelming majority of animals are born knowing how to speak their species’ “language”.

For example, sperm whales in the Caribbean use a different clicking pattern to those in the Pacific and Ornithologists can immediately identify a white-crowned sparrow’s place of birth from its song.', 'So the answer to our question above is “no”. Animals do not speak in regional accents as we do but the way they communicate can change according to where they live.', 'Even though most animals are like the macaques and have language set in their genes, animals are still able to communicate with each other, despite a language barrier in most species.

"ELIA5 How do predators, like big cats, and prey, like gazelles, coexist near watering holes?","Predators and prey can coexist near watering holes due to a variety of reasons. Predators, like big cats, often only attack prey that they can sneak up on, and the prey animals can recognize when the predator is just there for a drink and not to hunt[1]. Additionally, predators can only eat so many prey animals and they don't kill just to kill[1][2]. Even in areas where water is scarce, predators and prey can often drink from the same spot 10 feet from one another[3]. In areas where prey is scarcer, the three species' hunting activity may overlap, but the prey will usually avoid the predators[4]. Finally, research is currently being conducted on the behavior of predators and prey to help understand how humans and wildlife can coexist, and potentially find mutually beneficial ways to do so[5].","[""I don't know about all predators, but I do know that lions will only attack prey that they can sneak up and get the drop on. In other words, if a gazelle can see a lion, it doesn't have to worry about being attacked by that lion, and they can both take a drink from the same watering hole in peace. A lion needing a drink will just mosey on up to the water, and any prey animals that see it know its just there for the drink, not to kill."", ""Predators can only eat so many gazelles, and unlike humans, they (generally) don't kill just to kill, and only kill to eat when they are hungry. Or if another predator is encroaching on their territory."", 'In the Safari where water is scarces I would assume predators would use water holes as hunting locations. However, they often drink from the same spot 10 feet from one another. Do they?', ""However, when prey was scarcer the three species' hunting activity did overlap. Even then, the images showed that the dholes avoided the big cats. Similarly, in an area abundant with both predator and prey, the leopards actively avoided tigers."", 'These current YSE PhD students have fanned out across the globe in search of big cats. From lions to pumas to leopards, they are studying different aspects of how these predators and their prey interact with humans and landscapes and influence each other’s behaviors. Their work will shed light on human-wildlife conflict and advance mutually beneficial ways that communities on the ground can coexist with big cats.']"
"What causes milk to go ""bad"" in a few hours of being exposed to room temperature, but keeps it ""fresh"" inside the cows body?","Milk can go bad in a few hours due to the exposure to light and heat[1], which triggers a chemical reaction in the milk that modifies specific components of proteins and fats, resulting in characteristic off-flavors. Non-dairy milks must also be kept below 40°F to prevent harmful bacteria growth[1][2]. Dairy products last longer and taste better when kept cold[4], and potentially harmful bacteria grow at warmer temperatures[5]. All of this is necessary to keep it fresh, as milk can become contaminated with many different kinds of bacteria when it leaves the cow[3].","['The light-oxidized defect develops in milk as a result of its exposure to sunlight or to fluorescent lighting common in store dairy cases (especially bulbs with wavelengths below 620 nm). Light initiates a chemical reaction in milk that modifies specific components of proteins and fats, resulting in characteristic off-flavors. Exposure to sunlight for as little as 10–15 minutes (as short as 5 minutes on a very clear day with intense sunlight) is sufficient to cause the defect, while longer exposure times are generally required for fluorescent lighting. The closer the milk is to the fluorescent light source or the more intense the light, the quicker the development of the off-flavor (within 1–2 hours in some cases). In general, the defect is more common in milk packaged in transparent plastic or glass, although it can also occur in milk in more opaque containers with very intense light and sufficient exposure time.', 'Before you take your dairy milk out of the door and replace it with your favorite almond or soy milk, know that non-dairy milks—even those that are shelf-stable at room temperature prior to being opened—must also be kept below 40 F to prevent harmful bacteria growth. If your shelf-stable non-dairy milk is unopened, you can store it in the refrigerator door to keep it chilled only until you unseal the carton.', 'From the time the milk leaves the cow till you drink it, it can become contaminated with many different kinds of bacteria–some good, but some bad. At the dairy, the milk is heated (pasteurized) to kill bacteria, and sealed. This kills most of the bacteria, but not all.', 'All milk should be promptly refrigerated, otherwise it will turn sour within a matter of hours. Dairy products last longer and taste better when kept cold–at 45°F or below.

what makes water murky or clear? Does this affect sea creatures?,"Water murkiness or clarity is largely determined by the presence of sediment and planktonic algae in the water[5]. Sediment particles, such as smaller, finer sand, can make water murkier since they are easily agitated[4]. Planktonic algae can also cause water to appear murky due to the visually dense blooms they create on the surface[5]. This can affect sea creatures because murky water is usually more nutrient-rich than clear water[1], so it can provide a more hospitable environment for marine life.","[""There are areas in the Pacific that still have clear water and heavy waves, but that's because of what's in the water. Cloudier, gray water is more nutrient-rich than clear, sparkling water. Murky water is home to a lot of marine life like jellyfish, too."", ""Some beaches have crystal clear water while others are murky and gray. While you might think pollution turns clear water murky, there's usually a different explanation."", ""Some beaches have crystal clear water while others are murky and gray. While you might think pollution turns clear water murky, there's usually a different explanation, according to AccuWeather."", 'Sediment plays a big factor in water color. Smaller, more fine sand particles can make water murkier since they are easily agitated. In clear water, sediments may be coarser and tougher to stir up since they are heavier and made of shell pieces and dead coral chunks.', 'Water murkiness is not always a result of muck or suspended sediment. Water can also appear murky due to the presence of planktonic algae, which are microscopic organisms that create visually dense blooms on the water’s surface. Planktonic algae are known to appear in blue, green, brown, and red colors, which are most apparent around the shoreline. Similar to bottom muck, the high concentrations of these algae are typically a result of poor oxygen concentrations and high levels of nutrient pollution.']"
"Food is made up of fats, carbohydrates, and protein, but what gives different foods their flavor and how do they work?","Fats give food flavor, texture, and moisture[1], and are the main types of macronutrients in food, along with carbohydrates and proteins[2][3][4]. These three groups of molecules have distinct characteristics that influence the flavor of food, such as browning reactions and taste[3]. Proteins are made up of chains of amino acids and are essential for providing structure to bones, muscles, and skin, and also play a role in conducting chemical reactions in the body[4]. Carbohydrates come in two forms: simple and complex. Simple carbohydrates are broken down quickly by the body and can be converted to fat, while complex carbohydrates are broken down more slowly and are less likely to be converted to fat[5].","['Fats satisfy appetite (the desire to eat) because they add flavor to foods. Fat contains dissolved compounds that contribute to mouth-watering aromas and flavors. Fat also adds texture, making baked foods moist and flakey, fried foods crispy, and adding creaminess to foods like ice cream and cream cheese. Consider fat-free cream cheese; when fat is removed from the cream, much of the flavor is also lost. As a result, it is grainy and flavorless—nothing like its full-fat counterpart—and many additives are used to replace the lost flavor.', 'Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are the main types of macronutrients in food (nutrients that are required daily in large quantities). They supply 90% of the dry weight of the diet and 100% of its energy. All three provide energy (measured in calories), but the amount of energy in 1 gram (1/28 ounce) differs:', 'For now we won’t dive into how these molecules are build, drawn and shown. Instead, let’s start applying what we learned so far by looking at the most common groups of molecules in food: carbohydrates, proteins and fats. These molecules are also called ‘macronutrients’ and are essential for us from a nutritional point of view. The three groups of molecules have very distinct characteristics that will influence how your food will turn out. They play a major role in browning reactions for example as well as flavour development and taste.', 'Proteins are large molecules composed of chains of amino acids, which are simple subunits made of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Food sources of proteins include meats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of plant-based foods, like beans, nuts, and seeds. The word protein comes from a Greek word meaning “of primary importance,” which is an apt description of these macronutrients as they are also known as the “workhorses” of life. Proteins provide structure to bones, muscles, and skin, and they play a role in conducting most of the chemical reactions occurring in the body. Scientists estimate that more than 100,000 different proteins exist within the human body. Proteins can also provide energy, though this is a relatively minor function, as carbohydrates and fat are preferred energy sources.', '- Complex carbohydrates: These carbohydrates are composed of long strings of simple carbohydrates. Because complex carbohydrates are larger molecules than simple carbohydrates, they must be broken down into simple carbohydrates before they can be absorbed. Thus, they tend to provide energy to the body more slowly than simple carbohydrates but still more quickly than protein or fat. Because they are digested more slowly than simple carbohydrates, they are less likely to be converted to fat. They also increase blood sugar levels more slowly and to lower levels than simple carbohydrates but for a longer time. Complex carbohydrates include starches and fibers, which occur in wheat products (such as breads and pastas), other grains (such as rye and corn), beans, and root vegetables (such as potatoes and sweet potatoes).']"
Why does food always seem to be getting more expensive even though farming technologies are improving?,"Despite improvements in farming technologies, food is still getting more expensive because of the high cost of investments in food and agriculture technologies. These investments are high risk and there is limited appetite to fund some of the early-stage technologies[4], which can make scaling up innovations difficult. Additionally, the lack of access to food is due to uneven distribution, so simply producing more food will not be enough to improve food security for marginalised groups[2]. Furthermore, a focus on high-tech solutions may lock us into or reinforce sub-optimal production methods, such as precision farming being used to enable more precise application of agro-chemicals[3].","['For example, precision farming and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions can maximise crop yields. Technologies can help livestock emit less methane, and plant-based and lab-grown foods enable us to produce protein products with far less strain on resources than conventional animal proteins. Vertical farms can help us produce more food with less land, less water and no harmful pesticides, and drone technology and satellites allow farmers to evaluate crop conditions and reduce reliance on harmful fertilisers. Breakthroughs in science and new seed and soil technologies can help to regenerate the soil, to capture more carbon and to improve the nutritional value of foods.', 'One critique of some new food technologies is that while they often help increase the efficiency of production, the lack of access to food is actually due to uneven distribution, and therefore simply producing more food will not allow us to improve food security for marginalised groups.', 'It has also been argued that a focus on high-tech solutions may lock us into or reinforce sub-optimal production methods. For example, although precision farming can enable more precise application of agro-chemicals, it merely results in making an intrinsically damaging approach less harmful. For this reason, it is important to take a broad look at the food system as a whole, and work out which innovations are most effective in which circumstances. Some technologies may only be appropriate once the basic building blocks of efficient crop production are in place, particularly in developing countries.', 'Investments in food and agriculture technologies have the potential for an extremely high return for society as a whole: They can solve both sustainability and health challenges and create new economic opportunities. However, investments in some of the early-stage technologies required to scale up innovations are also high risk. This has meant that, although investments have increased over time, there has generally been a limited appetite to fund some of these technologies. For example:', '1. Innovations that can increase the quality of foods and farming. Whereas innovations during the green revolution enabled farmers to produce larger quantities of food with less land, new innovations enable us to increase the quality of foods and farming. Precision-farming technologies and advances in biotechnology mean we can reduce reliance on agrichemicals, improve soil quality and make foods more nutritious. This means we can still get more from our food system with fewer inputs, but with less strain on the world’s natural resources.']"

"What do entertainment products (movies, video games, etc.) have different release date in different countries?","The timing of the release of entertainment products such as movies, video games, and television shows can vary based on the country they are being released in. This is due to differences in consumer preferences between countries and the need to acknowledge such heterogeneity by adopting different channel solutions[1][3]. The timing of reviews can also vary, with scores typically not changing much over time for major releases, while reviews for limited releases will trickle in over time as it is added to new geographic markets[2]. Additionally, the coordination of international releases of entertainment products is an issue, as it is important to determine if a product should be released simultaneously across the world or sequentially[3]. Finally, for some entertainment products, the short-term timing of release can have an effect on success[3][5].","['- Optimal distribution configurations for producers varied strongly between countries—and probably still do. The best scenario for a producer in the U.S. was a simultaneous release in theaters, DVD rental, and EST,42 followed by a DVD sales release just three months later. In Fig. 13.6, we report the resulting effects for producers (as well as the different distributors) and contrast them with the results for Germany—where the ideal model was an exclusive theatrical release, followed by a DVD retail release three months later, with another nine-month wait before a film is released on DVD rental and VOD. Consumer preferences regarding channels vary between countries, and channel solutions need to acknowledge such heterogeneity. But we acknowledge that having different distribution patterns in different parts of the world carries its own challenges, given that in today’s digital age, entertainment travels fast between continents.', 'For major-release movies and television shows, scores typically will not change much over time, as most reviews will be published on or before the day of release. (We will usually get all of those reviews posted by late morning of that day.) For a limited release film, reviews trickle in over time as the film is added to new geographic markets. For games and albums, reviews are even less standard and will show up anywhere from one month before to three to six months after the release date.', 'Before we move on to a more in-depth investigation of the effects of illegal channels (and how they can be dealt with as part of entertainment distribution), let us mention that a related timing problem exists for the coordination of international releases of entertainment products. Should a product be released simultaneously across the world (as it is usually done with games and music), or sequentially (as it is often the case with movies and books)? With cannibalization being less of an issue between (most) countries versus between channels (“geoblocking” and languages help managers to limit inter-country substitution), a key element of this problem is the existence of SBS effects between countries—something we already addressed in some detail in the communication chapter of this book.', 'Timing the release of a new entertainment product is a multi-faceted decision. In the following, we discuss both the “isolated” timing of a release and its timing in relation to competitive offerings. Please note that we do not discuss the coordination of release timing between channels at this point, but have dedicated a separate section to this prevalent issue.', 'Finally, for some entertainment products, the short-term timing of release can have an effect on success. This timing dimension applies in particular to products that are part of a linear distribution mechanism where the consumption time is determined by the producer/distributor instead of the consumer, such as series and movies on TV, songs on radio, and movies in theaters.']"
Why do people set up fake company Facebook pages promoting non-existing contests?,"Fake company Facebook pages promoting non-existing contests are often set up to take advantage of people's desires to win prizes and engage with a business for minimal effort. They use Facebook contests as a way to draw attention to their page and gain likes and shares, without offering anything of actual value. These fake contests also often lack a relevant strategy, like providing a legitimate case study or creating quality content, and instead rely on broad topics and fake fans to ""like"" the page[3].

"Why is it that when the bees die out, we die?","If all the bees died, it would have a devastating effect on the environment and the food chain. Pollination is one of the most important services that bees provide, as they are responsible for pollinating many of the crop products that humans use daily[4].

This would also alter ecosystems, as many animals, such as bee-eater birds, would lose their prey and impact natural systems and food webs[3].

When you work out/do cardio do you burn the same amount of calories when you first start off compared to when you are conditioned if you do the same workout?,"Generally speaking, when you first start off doing a workout/cardio, you will burn more calories than when you are conditioned if you do the same workout. This is because when you first start off, you are able to push yourself harder and exert more energy during a cardio workout than when you are lifting weights, and cardio is well-documented to be effective at burning calories[4]. Additionally, you will use more energy and expend more calories doing aerobic training than strength training because you are moving consistently[2]. However, weight lifting can also help burn calories after you're done exercising due to the ""afterburn"" effect[4]. Depending on how heavy you are lifting, starting with weights can also tire you out before you make it to the cardio portion of your workout, so it is important to experiment with both starting with cardio and starting with weights to see which one works best for you[5].","[""If you were to hook yourself up to a metabolic monitor and measure your energy expenditure, cardio initially is going to burn more calories, Keith says. Generally speaking, many people are able to push themselves harder, therefore exerting more energy, during a cardio workout than when they're lifting weights. This can translate to more calories burned during said cardio session—like a speed run—than a lifting session of the same duration."", 'That said, you shouldn\'t skip cardio altogether. ""Ultimately, you use more energy and expend more calories doing aerobic training because you\'re moving consistently, whereas, with strength training, you may be using two-thirds of your time recovering, so adding some cardio can increase your overall calorie burn,"" says Sternlicht.', 'Another big plus for cardio is that you’ll burn more calories during your workout than you would when weight training (big emphasis on during).', 'Cardio is well-documented to be effective at burning calories.

Why are researchers still able to test on animals?,"Researchers still test on animals because there is no reliable alternative for testing, such as a complex living, breathing, whole-organ system with pulmonary and circulatory structures like those in humans[4].

Does losing weights activities only involve cardio ?,"No, losing weight activities do not only involve cardio. While it is true that doing steady state cardio can help with weight loss, experts say it is not necessary if your main goal is fat loss[1]. You can lose weight just by lifting weights[1][2], and diversifying your workout routine with strength training is more efficient for weight loss compared to daily cardio[2]. Additionally, doing cardio every day can lead to injury[3], and strength training helps to build muscle mass that boosts metabolism and helps to burn fat[4].

That's because daily cardio can not only be boring, which makes it hard to do consistently, but it's also inefficient compared with more diverse workout routines that include strength training."", '- Doing cardio every day can lead to injury. If you only do one kind of exercise, every day, you put your body at risk of overuse injuries.

Why do we use rats to test products?,"Rats are widely used for product testing because of their genetic consistency, ability to reproduce quickly and in large litters, and their physiological similarities to humans[3]. They are tested for any genetic defects that may affect the results of the experiments, and their systems should react to chemicals in a similar way to those of a human test subject[2][5]. This makes them ideal subjects for testing potential health hazards, as examining various generations of a test subject all at once can provide more definitive proof of a product's safety or potential threat[3].","[""If people are against testing cosmetics on animals, then why do we openly welcome the use of rats in scientific experiments bound to cause more damage than cosmetic defects? Is it because they are dirtier than most animals? They aren't. Is it because they carry more diseases? They really don't."", 'Another reason laboratories use rats is genetic consistency. Those raised for animal testing are tested for any genetic defects that may affect the results of the experiments. Only animals with known genetic histories are candidates for testing. Since rats tend to breed frequently, their offspring can also be tested for any genetic abnormalities possibly caused by exposure to the test product. Since the researchers would know of any genetic predispositions towards weight gain or cancer formation, for example, they can safely eliminate these factors as related to the test product.', ""Because rats reproduce quickly and tend to have large litters, researchers do not have to wait long to evaluate test results in generations. The grandsons and granddaughters of original test animals could appear within months, not the years it would take in human subjects. When looking for potential health hazards, examining various generations of a test subject all at once can provide more definitive proof of a product's safety or potential threat. Overseers such as the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) require this level of proof before even considering human clinical trials. Although the issue of animal testing remains controversial, there can be no doubt that the use of rats in laboratory studies has provided a number of advances in the medical, food and cosmetics industries."", 'The use of rats and mice is far more useful than using untested products on humans. For you God-fearing individuals, I also am a believer but I believe that he allows us to use these more minor creatures for this purpose. If he did not intend this then why would he give them such short life spans, weak nerve responses, and high rates of reproduction?', ""A number of laboratory tests performed on rats involve the safety of chemicals, whether used in medicines, food products or cosmetics. Because they are mammals, their systems should react to these chemicals in a similar way to those of a human test subject. In order to be considered safe enough for human consumption or exposure, a new chemical compound must first be tested on other mammals. Laboratory rats are often fed extremely high amounts of a new food additive or injected with large doses of a new chemical compound. Theoretically, if the test product is completely safe for humans, it shouldn't matter if they ingest two hundred times the recommended levels.""]"
Why people choose to be vegetarian.,"There are many different reasons why people choose to become vegetarian. One reason is concern over the way that animals are raised and treated in food production[1]. Another is for health reasons[5].

How do humans not have mating rituals or mating calls like other animals?,"Humans do not have mating rituals or mating calls like other animals because they do not need them. Humans do not have a true ""mating season"" and instead have sex throughout the year. This is different from other animals, who employ visual and auditory cues as part of their elaborate courtship displays[3]. Humans also don't have the same needs for touch and vocal communication to solidify social bonds[4], so they do not need mating rituals or mating calls like other animals. This is because humans don't have a dominance hierarchy where subordinates are not capable of interfering with the alpha pair's mating[5].","['The ethnographic and zoological literature reviewed here provides two constructive conclusions. First, that the concealment of legitimate mating is a widespread human preference. This prevalence emphasizes the importance of also studying the phenomenon from an evolutionary perspective . Second, the current hypotheses on the functions of concealed mating do not sufficiently explain why habitual concealment of matings evolved in humans and Arabian babblers but is absent in other social species.', '""Humans don\'t have a true \'mating season\' simply because sex is had throughout the year, rather than saving it for a specific time,"" says author and professional matchmaker Dominique Clark.

One must also succeed in attracting a suitable mate. Animals use a broad range of strategies to advertise themselves in the mating market. In some instances, visual cues highlight a morphological feature - for example, the peacock's tail. Auditory courtship displays are common across many types of animal, including birds (song), frogs (vocalisation), monkeys (calls), whales (song) and crocodiles (bellowing). Many species employ visual and auditory cues as part of their elaborate courtship displays. Specific behaviours are also part of the signalling repertoire and might include fighting (rams), dancing (red-capped manakin), applying make-up (flamingos) or creating art (satin bowerbird). In some instances, courtship displays take place within a communal space known as a lek."", 'The similarities in courtship patterns between humans and nonhuman primates stems from our shared social behavior ancestry, says Dr. Jacqueline Prime, founder of the environmental nonprofit Prime Earth and a wild gibbon researcher. “We are social creatures that rely on group members for our survival and reproductive success,"" she says.

Humans aren\'t really different from any other non-human primate on this, we just have different styles and ways of doing things.”', ""I propose that legitimate mating in humans is comparable to matings between the most dominant individuals in a social group of non-human animals (table 1) since both phenomena raise the same question: why do individuals, whose matings are not subject to physical interruption by conspecifics, conceal it from the sensory perception of others ? This question on concealed mating is therefore only relevant for social species with distinct dominance hierarchies where subordinates are not capable of interfering with the alpha pair's mating (see the social interference hypothesis in §5).""]"
Why does the meat of a young animal taste so much better than that of an older one?,"The meat of a young animal typically tastes better than that of an older one because older animals move more over time, which creates more blood circulation and it’s that circulation that creates flavor compounds, making older meat more flavorful[1]. Some studies seem to indicate that meat from older cattle may taste as good as or better than beef from younger cattle[2], and when comparing a young vs older grass fed animal, the older beef prevailed in most categories[3]. Additionally, people are so hyper-focused on the tenderness of their meats, they’ve neglected to consider optimum flavor[4], and older animals offer great flavor at bargain prices, and the meat goes down easier when you know that the animal in question lived a full, natural life before making its way to your plate[5].","['The age of an animal impacts meat flavor more than it influences tenderness.

"How do animals (with bullying type personality) instinctively change their personality to protect their puppies, cubs, etc when they become parents?","Animals with bullying type personalities instinctively change their personalities to protect their puppies, cubs, etc when they become parents by displaying maternal aggression. This aggression is directed toward people or other animals that approach them, and can range from showing their teeth and growling to outright biting. This behavior usually appears within hours of giving birth, as the new mother focuses on caring for her litter[3]. This behavior is likely due to the instinct to protect her offspring, as well as tiredness, fluctuating hormones, and discomfort after the birth[3]. While research suggests that aggression, which characterizes the perpetrator role in bullying, may have heritable components[4], the role of genetic influences on both perpetrating and being a target of bullying requires more empirical attention[4].","['There are several reasons for discrepancies between and within studies of the genetic contribution to bullying behavior. One reason is related to how peer victimization is assessed. Parent-, teacher-, peer-, and self-reports of bullying victimization have been shown to vary considerably across reporters (Ostrov and Kamper, 2015; Patton et al., 2015; Shakoor et al., 2011); thus, the method used to assess involvement with bullying may lead to different results. Another reason for the differences may be related to development. The influence of the environment is expected to change as children age. Young children are particularly sensitive to family influences, while the influence of peers tends to matter more during adolescence (Harris, 1995). Moreover, the type of environment a person is exposed to (i.e., harsh or nurturing) interacts with genes to produce a brain that is tailored to deal with the particular demands of that environment.', 'Maternal aggression is directed toward people or other animals that approach the bitch with her puppies. Bitches that experience a pseudopregnancy (false pregnancy) may also become aggressive and begin to protect nesting areas or stuffed toys at the approximate time when the puppies would have been born.

"What is ""Grim Trigger"" and how would it relate to international relations?","Grim Trigger is a trigger strategy for a repeated game in game theory[1][4].

It is a limiting case in international relations and is called ""Friedman"" in Robert Axelrod's book The Evolution of Cooperation[1][2]. In iterated prisoner's dilemma strategy competitions, grim trigger performs poorly even without noise, and adding signal errors makes it even worse[5].","['Under the grim trigger in international relations perspective, a nation cooperates only if its partner has never exploited it in the past. Because a nation will refuse to cooperate in all future periods once its partner defects once, the indefinite removal of cooperation becomes the threat that makes such strategy a limiting case.

Once the player finds that the opponent has betrayed in the previous game, he will then defect forever.', 'In game theory, grim trigger (also called the grim strategy or just grim) is a trigger strategy for a repeated game.', ""In iterated prisoner's dilemma strategy competitions, grim trigger performs poorly even without noise, and adding signal errors makes it even worse. Its ability to threaten permanent defection gives it a theoretically effective way to sustain trust, but because of its unforgiving nature and the inability to communicate this threat in advance, it performs poorly.""]"
How can scientists tell if living beings like insects and crustaceans feel pain or not?,"Scientists can tell if living beings like insects and crustaceans feel pain or not by analyzing their nervous system structures.

"Are plant sources of saturated fat only from tropical areas and if so, why is that the case?","Plant sources of saturated fat come from tropical oils such as palm oil, palm kernel oil, and coconut oil[2][3][5]. These tropical oils are high in saturated fat and are increasingly being used in processed foods to replace trans fats[2][3]. Other plant sources of saturated fat include non-tropical plant-based oils, such as olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils, as well as avocados, nuts, and seeds[4].","['Saturated fats are found in animal products and tropical oils. Whether these fats increase disease risk has long been a controversial topic, with more recent study results showing that ultra-processed, carb-rich, and sugary foods may pose more risks.', 'Saturated fat in the diet comes from a number of vegetable and animal sources. The main vegetable oil sources are palm oil, palm kernel oil, coconut oil, cocoa butter and the fats generally used in cocoa butter equivalents. The most common animal sources are either in the form of milk fats or from the carcass of an animal. Cow’s milk fat is by far the most commonly consumed milk fat, not only in its basic form in milk but in other dairy products such as butter and cheese. Animal carcass fats are consumed both as part of the meat of the animal (with beef, lamb or mutton, pork and venison being the most important of these) or as a component of other food products. A further source of saturates is from hydrogenated vegetable oils.', 'Other food companies are turning to tropical oils such as palm oil to replace trans fats. Palm oil contains about 50% unsaturated and 50% saturated fats. According to Gerald McNeill, vice president of research and development at IOI Loders Croklaan, an edible oil supplier with US headquarters in Channahon, Illinois, palm oil is making a huge comeback after being decimated by anti-saturated-fat media campaigns in the 1970s. When McNeill first started working with palm oil, he thoroughly researched the literature on saturated fat. “If saturated fat was really that unhealthy and artery-clogging, I didn’t want to be involved with that,” he says. “I read all the literature, and I decided there was no evidence whatsoever that saturated fat has any effect on heart disease, good or bad.”', 'Monounsaturated fat sources include non-tropical plant-based oils, such as olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils, as well as avocados, nuts, and seeds.

Why do we subtract fiber and alcohol sugars from total carbs when on a keto/low carb diet?,"Fiber and alcohol sugars are subtracted from total carbs when on a keto/low carb diet because they are not fully digestible and therefore are not considered part of the net carb count. Sugar alcohols are still counted as total carbohydrates, but most people following the keto diet subtract the grams of sugar alcohols entirely or deduct a certain percentage from the total carbohydrate count[1]. Additionally, sugar alcohols such as erythritol contain no carbs and don't tend to affect blood-sugar levels[4], which is beneficial for those following a low-carb diet. However, for people with type 1 diabetes, fiber may still influence blood sugar, so counting total carbs may be more beneficial[2].","['Sugar alcohols are still counted as total carbohydrates BUT since they are not fully digestible MOST people following the keto diet subtract the grams of sugar alcohols entirely. Similar to how you might deduct dietary fiber to get a net carb calculation. Whilst others deduct a certain percentage from the total carbohydrate count.', 'There are instances when net carbs may not be the best marker for counting carbs on a low-carb keto diet. In people with type 1 diabetes, fiber may still influence blood sugar, although the research is not conclusive. Those dealing with this condition may be better off counting total carbs.', 'While the total count of grams of fiber is subtracted from total carbs to reach a net carb count in packaged foods and recipes, many people subtract half of the grams of any sugar alcohols listed on food packages or listed in recipes from total carbs to get your net carb count. An exception to this rule is with respect to erythritol (if it’s the only sugar listed then its carbs can be completely subtracted from the total carb count).', 'Now let’s try an example of calculating net carbs with a food that contains sugar alcohols. There are many keto and low-carb products that utilize sugar-alcohol-based sweeteners to sweeten food products without adding carbs (or in the case of some sugar alcohols, adding minimal carbs). But there are also recipes that call for sugar alcohols. While there are many out there (maltitol, xylitol, sorbitol, etc.), we recommend erythritol sweetener, which, unlike some sugar alcohols, contains absolutely no carbs and doesn’t tend to affect blood-sugar levels. So, for this example, we’ll go with homemade keto whipped cream (2 cups heavy whipping cream and 2 teaspoons erythritol, whipped together).', 'That’s where the use of sugar alcohols come in! They offer those who follow low-carb diets a great alternative to regular sugar such as table sugar which is known for its very high glycemic index, spiking blood glucose and insulin levels. And avoiding insulin resistance is one of the biggest health advantages of the keto diet.']"
What do slaughterhouses do with leftover bones?,"After animals are slaughtered, the bones are usually considered as slaughterhouse waste and are disposed of in landfills, rendering plants, municipal sewers, or incineration plants[1]. After rendering, some of the waste is reused as meat and bone meal for animal feed, fertilizers, and bulk pet food ingredients[1][4]. Bones can also become valuable materials after being processed by bone processing equipment, such as bone crushing machines and bone paste grinding machines[2].","['The consumption of fresh meat is increasing globally every year. This means that slaughterhouses, as well as meat and fish processing plants, produce an enormous amount of beef, pork, poultry and fish bones as a side stream to their core business. This growing amount of category 3 bone residue, among other waste materials, has considered as one of the significant environmental challenges that the food industry is facing today. Every year the global slaughter industry produces 130 billion kg of animal bone residues. More than 10% of this waste is generated in the EU. After slaughtering, one animal produces about 18 weight% bone residues of its total live weight1. Instead of utilizing valuable bones material commercially, those have been usually considered as and treated as slaughterhouse waste and are disposed in landfills and rendering plants.', 'After animals are slaughtered, meat is what most people need, and the demand for meat and its big economic benefits are the focus of social concern. However, the animal bones are treated as tailpieces with no use value, so they are not getting good utilization, which causes a huge waste of available resources, and is not good for creating economic profits and protecting the environment. After bone processing by bone process equipment, such as bone crushing machines and bone paste grinding machines, animal bones can become valuable materials.', ""Metal screens trap solids like skin trimmings, hair, bones and hooves. Grease traps capture fat. Outside slaughterhouses enormous containers hold all these leftovers until tankers come to take them away. In most countries this type of waste has to be heat-treated and sanitised to make sure it poses no danger to human or animal health. Only then can it be disposed of in municipal sewers, in incineration plants or, if possible, made into 'value-added' products, including feed for animals."", 'After rendering, part of this waste is usually reused as meat and bone meal for animal feed, fertilizers and bulk pet food ingredients. This procedure is costly due to the disposal fees for bones represent a significant expenditure expense for the slaughtering, meat and fish processing industries.', 'EU legislation2 for food safety rules for the processing of animal by-products, i.e., all bone residues from slaughterhouses must be disposed of by rendering. However, current large-scale rendering method has three main fundamental effects of slaughterhouse, food production and farming industries. These are high costs, raw material loss, and unsustainability of processes. Rendering plants are commercial bodies that charge service fees for disposing of animal waste. Therefore, rendering fees are by law imposed extra costs for the slaughter industry. For example, in 2017 in Finland meat producers had to pay at least 0,18 €/kg for disposal of bone residues.']"
How do animals pass on diseases to humans without being sick themselves?,"Animals can pass on diseases to humans without being sick themselves through different modes of transmission, such as direct zoonosis, where the disease is directly transmitted from non-humans to humans through media such as air or bites and saliva, or through an intermediate species that carry the disease pathogen without getting sick (vector-borne diseases)[2]. Swine and bird flu are two of the most recent examples of animals passing diseases to humans[3]. Additionally, humans can also pass diseases to animals through multiple species pathogens, which can infect a range of animals[4]. Furthermore, animals can sometimes carry harmful germs that can spread to people and cause illness, even when they appear healthy[5].","['For good reason, there is a great deal of interest in the transmission of diseases from animals to humans. Recently, however, medical researchers have started to ask the opposite question: can we make animals sick?', 'Zoonoses have different modes of transmission. In direct zoonosis the disease is directly transmitted from non-humans to humans through media such as air (influenza) or through bites and saliva (rabies). In contrast, transmission can also occur via an intermediate species (referred to as a vector), which carry the disease pathogen without getting sick. When humans infect non-humans, it is called reverse zoonosis or anthroponosis. The term is from Greek: ζῷον zoon ""animal"" and νόσος nosos ""sickness"".', 'Swine and bird flu are two of the most recent and startling examples of animals passing diseases to humans.', 'The fact that diseases can pass from humans to animals is, perhaps, not such a surprise. An estimated 61.6 percent of human pathogens are regarded as multiple species pathogens and are able to infect a range of animals. Also, over 77 percent of pathogens that infect livestock are multiple species pathogens.', 'However, animals can sometimes carry harmful germs that can spread to people and cause illness – these are known as zoonotic diseases or zoonoses. Zoonotic diseases are caused by harmful germs like viruses, bacterial, parasites, and fungi. These germs can cause many different types of illnesses in people and animals, ranging from mild to serious illness and even death. Animals can sometimes appear healthy even when they are carrying germs that can make people sick, depending on the zoonotic disease.']"

What happens to all the blood from predator and prey of fish in the oceans?,"When prey species are overfished in the oceans, the natural predators (fish, sea birds, and marine mammals) no longer have enough food to survive, leading to scrawny and emaciated predators that are vulnerable to disease and without enough energy to reproduce. This is caused by humans fishing in breeding areas and allowing overfishing of the prey species, leading to food shortages in the ocean[3]. This has caused the fishing industry to point its bows south, leading to the same trajectory in the southern hemisphere[5]. Ultimately, this could lead to an ocean with increasingly hungry predators, unless current trends are reversed.[1]","['For many prey species, humans have replaced their natural predators—the other fish, the sea birds, the marine mammals—all the species that depend on them for their existence.

Why does drinking juice only feel good /while/ I'm drinking it?,"Drinking juice only feels good while you're drinking it because it provides your body with a hit of sugar, but without any fiber or solid food, it will not keep you full. Additionally, if you drink juice on a full stomach, it prevents your body from quickly absorbing the nutrients from the juice[3]. Although juice provides your body with vitamins and minerals, it does not deserve its health halo since whole food consumption is preferred over a liquid diet[5].","['When you first start juicing, you may not feel as amazing as you thought you would, but this should be temporary. In other words, you may feel worse before you feel better. This is important to note because many people may start juicing and only last a few days because they don’t feel well. They give up and think “this just isn’t for me.” However, this concept is similar to giving up a caffeinated beverage (like coffee or soda), where you may initially get headaches or feel sleepy, but if you keep pushing through those withdrawal symptoms, you’ll eventually start to feel better. Same with juicing. When you begin, you are feeding your body a vast amount of nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables. Your body (liver and kidney especially) will kick into overdrive to remove toxins, and also start to build newer, healthier tissues.', 'When your body gets a hit of sugar, it expects calories and substance to go along with it. When you drink a sugary juice without consuming any fiber to keep you satisfied, your body can get confused and hungry—potentially leading you to overeat later on. Kahan says studies have shown that consuming solid foods, as opposed to liquids, may offer more satiety, leading people to eat less afterward.', 'Not Drinking Green Juice On An Empty Stomach – Recently a blogger friend of mine tried juicing for the first time, and when she finished her first juice she proclaimed to me that it gave her heart burn. Immediately, I asked her if she drank her juice on an empty stomach, and she said “No, I had it after breakfast.” Fresh juice should only be consumed on an empty stomach. The whole point of drinking juice is diminished if you don’t, and can end up giving you digestive issues like my friend experienced. Drinking juice on an empty stomach allows the vitamins and minerals in the juice to go straight to your bloodstream. Having fiber or a meal already in your stomach prevents your body from quickly absorbing the nutrients from the juice. A good general rule of thumb to follow is to wait at least 2 hours after a meal to drink a green juice and wait 20 mins after drinking a green juice to consume a meal.', 'And without the missing fiber, juice won’t keep you full. Research has found that drinking nutrients is less satisfying than eating them. “While your body likes the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants [in juice], juices lack fiber and don’t require chewing, so they’re less satiating than whole produce,” explains New York City-based dietitian Cynthia Sass.', 'Juice can help you consume more vitamins and minerals, and that’s a positive for people who struggle to eat enough fruits and vegetables. But experts say it may not deserve its health halo. In a paper published last winter in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, experts scrutinized several nutrition-hyped foods—including juice—and wrote that “whole food consumption is preferred” over a liquid diet.']"
What a rabbit and eggs have anything to do with Easter.,"Rabbits and eggs have become symbols for Easter due to their ancient pagan roots in representing fertility and rebirth[1][4]. It is believed that early missionaries combined pagan traditions with Christian holidays to make the transition smoother for new believers, and so the celebration of Eostre and the resurrection of Christ became one[3][4]. Rabbits have long traditionally stood for fertility due to their high reproduction rates[4], and this is why the bunny has become a prevalent symbol in our modern Easter celebrations[5].","['Since rabbits are mammals (and give birth to live young), it might seem like a case of mistaken biology to say the Easter Bunny lays eggs on the holiday. Adding another miracle to the festivities, perhaps? The answer may lie in combining iconography. Eggs, just like the rabbit, have long been considered an ancient symbol of fertility, rebirth and new life, all associated with the springtime celebration of Easter!', 'As previously mentioned, the rabbit and the egg became intertwined with the spring holiday because of their pagan roots representing fertility and rebirth. It seems possible that these two images merged into the egg-laying rabbit of German lore, instead of a (practical) chicken.', ""One theory of the Easter Bunny's origins is that it stemmed from early pagan celebrations around the vernal equinox, says Time. Pagans celebrated the springtime renewal of life, as well as the goddess of dawn and fertility, Eostre, who was often represented by the hare or an egg. As Christianity spread throughout Europe, the celebrations around the vernal equinox may have merged with the observance of Christ's resurrection, because they both occurred around the same time. Missionaries were said to blend pagan traditions with Christian holidays to make the transition smoother for new believers, so it is possible that the celebrations of Eostre and the resurrection of Christ became one."", ""As Christians probably already know, the Bible makes no mention of a mythical hare who delivers eggs to children on the day of Jesus Christ's resurrection so it may be a head-scratcher why exactly a rabbit became a prominent part of one of Christianity's most important celebrations of rebirth and renewal. One theory, according to Time, is that the symbol of the rabbit stems from the ancient pagan tradition on which many of our Easter traditions are based — the festival of Eostre, which honored the goddess of fertility and spring. The goddess's animal symbol was a rabbit, which have long traditionally stood for fertility due to their high reproduction rates."", 'In the U.S., our Easter Sunday celebrations often go hand-in-hand with the Easter Bunny. Young children set out their Easter baskets (sometimes store-bought and sometimes a fun DIY Easter basket creation!) to see what kinds of chocolate bunnies and other special treats the fluffy, mythical creature has left in their baskets overnight. Like Santa Claus and Christmas, the mysterious bunny has no obvious connections to the post-Lent Christian holy day. So why, then, has it become such a prevalent symbol in our modern celebrations?']"
Why do we focus more on the Vietnam war and less on the Korean war?,"We focus more on the Vietnam War than the Korean War because the Vietnam War received a lot more media coverage in the US[2], leading to anti-war protests and putting pressure on President Johnson and later President Nixon to end the war. Additionally, there are more published works on the Vietnam War than the Korean War[2], and the works on the Korean War tend to focus on the political history of the country, rather than the tactical experiences[1][3]. Furthermore, the importance of the Korean and Vietnam wars goes beyond their strategic connection and has lasting implications for U.S. policy beyond the Cold War[4][5].","['42 Unlike in Korea, “the forgotten war,” the Vietnam War produced a huge literature on the political and cultural history of the country—but only after the United States had been involved for about a decade. That output shows no sign of slowing. Still, the Korean War has produced a number of distinguished works, including Bruce Cumings’ two-volume history cited previously; William Stueck’s The Korean War: An International History (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1995) and later works; Chen Jian’s China’s Road to the Korean War: The Making of the Sino-American Confrontation (New York: Columbia University Press, 1994); and David Halberstam’s The Coldest Winter: America and the Korean War (New York: Hyperion, 2007).', 'Unlike the Korean War, which did not get much media attention in the US, the Vietnam War received a lot of media coverage. Anti-war protests began in the US, pushing President Johnson to begin peace talks to end the war. After the 1968 election, President Nixon took over the peace talks and began focusing his attention on “Vietnamization”, which meant withdrawing US troops from Vietnam and providing the resources South Vietnamese troops needed to continue the war without the US', ""The author clearly explains the complexity of the political arrangements on the Korean Peninsula following the Second World War, Western decisions to go to war, negotiations to settle the conflict, and the ultimate aftermath for those involved. The narrative uses a bird’s eye view of political decision-making in various capitals. The fighting is broadly covered in part two of the book, focusing primarily on the employment of air power in simultaneously limiting ground casualties and solidifying the United Nations' military position in negotiations at Panmunjom. The operational level of war is the lowest level of war consistently covered in this section and throughout the book. However, this is less of a negative and shows a consistent focus by the author. Those looking for the tactical experiences will find much greater detail in David Halberstam’s Coldest Winter."", 'This paper will argue that the importance of the Korean and Vietnam wars goes beyond their strategic connection. The official mindsets that led to U.S. involvement, the centrality of the China threat in American decision making, and the common legacy of intervention against nationalism and in support of authoritarian regimes were all features of U.S. policy throughout the remainder of the Cold War in Asia. But not only then or there; after the Cold War, nationalist identities and U.S. internationalist ambitions collided repeatedly in other parts of the world.', '""The wars in Korea and Vietnam were of a piece, directly related by virtue of U.S. global strategy and China’s security concerns. This paper, focusing mainly on the U.S. side in these wars, argues that three characteristics of American policy had enduring meaning for the rest of the Cold War and even beyond: the official mindsets that led to U.S. involvement, the centrality of the China threat in American decision making, and the common legacy of intervention against nationalism and in support of authoritarian regimes. It is part of a continuing Asia-Pacific Journal series on the Korean War on the sixtieth anniversary of its outbreak.']"
Why are some animals so venomous?,"Venomous animals evolved their venom to defend themselves against predators and to help them capture prey more efficiently. Venom has evolved independently in various species at different times in the history of life[4]. Venom can be used to paralyze nerves, rot muscles, stop blood from clotting and subdue larger prey[3][5]. Some mammals, such as vampire bats, platypuses, shrews and solenodons, also use their venom for self-defense or to capture prey[5].","['But not all venomous snakes are so dangerous. For example, the marbled sea snake has only a tiny amount of very weak venom, making it effectively harmless to any relatively large animals such as humans. Why venoms vary so much in their ability to kill or incapacitate potential prey animals has long puzzled scientists, with several competing hypotheses suggested as explanations.', 'Some venomous snakes are far more dangerous than others. For example, a cobra or a rattlesnake can kill thousands of animals and several adult humans with a single reserve of venom, while a marbled sea snake has only a tiny amount of weak venom and is harmless to large animals.', 'Venom is the mark of a special club, a select subset of the animal kingdom. It includes vipers, jellyfish, spiders, scorpions, centipedes, bees, cone snails, newts, platypus, and even a primate. All these animals produce molecules that attack a victim in minutes or even seconds. The molecules are intricately complex, with shapes that allow them to precisely lock onto certain proteins on our own cells. Depending on its exact target in the body, venom will paralyze nerves, rot muscles, and stop blood from clotting.', 'Venomous animals are not all closely related to each other. The platypus is much more closely related to us, for example, than it is to a centipede. And that means that venom has independently evolved many times over in the history of life. First there were animals without venom, and then there were.', ""A few mammals do have venom. Vampire bats, which have a toxic saliva that prevents blood clots, use their chemical weapon to feed from wounds more effectively. Venomous shrews and shrew-like solenodons (small, burrowing mammals) can outpunch their weight class by using their venom to subdue larger prey than they could otherwise kill. Shrews also sometimes use their venom to paralyze prey (typically insects and other invertebrates) for storage and later snacking. Meanwhile, platypuses, which don't have a venomous bite but do have a venomous spur on their hind legs, mostly use their venom in fights with other platypuses over mates or territory, Jenner said.""]"
Why do graphics cards seem to be the default crypto currency mining hardware?,"Graphics cards are the default crypto currency mining hardware because they are great for computing the complex equations the blockchain has in place to verify transactions[2]. They also do this faster and cheaper (and greener) than a CPU can[3]. Furthermore, RTX cards are good for crypto mining due to their balance between cost and performance, and the amount of power they use for the hash rate they generate[4]. Additionally, as computer hardware becomes more powerful, cryptocurrencies become more difficult to mine, thus requiring more powerful hardware[5].","['The last year or so has been hard on gamers looking to build their own PC, and the reason is tied primarily to cryptocurrency’s popularity. It’s been years since graphics cards were used en masse for Bitcoin mining, because the hardware arms race meant that specialized application-specific integrated chip (ASIC) mining hardware quickly overtook them. Ethereum mining, however, as with other digital currencies, doesn’t benefit in the same way from specialized hardware, and so graphics cards are a great solution for mining them, and that’s leading to stock shortages and price hikes.', 'If you’ve been paying attention to the GPU market since 2020, you know that crypto miners are playing a big role in the GPU shortage. And if you’re building a crypto mining rig, you should know graphics cards are great for computing the complex equations the blockchain has in place to verify transactions. As miners solve these equations, newer and more complex equations take their place, requiring more powerful hardware to compute in a timely fashion.', 'So, since mining is basically just guessing numbers (assuming this means the algorithm to brute force the guess has been optimized for the GPU architecture) the graphics cards do this faster and cheaper (and greener) than a CPU can.', 'Another reason RTX cards are good for crypto mining is their balance between cost and performance. Particularly, the amount of power they use for the hash rate they generate. AMD’s cards were dominant for years when it came to mining performance for Ethereum and other GPU-based cryptocurrencies. And they also generally cost less and use less electricity. But the tides are turning in Nvidia’s favor.', 'As computer hardware becomes more powerful, cryptocurrencies become more difficult to mine, thus requiring more powerful hardware. That means that once the mining difficulty becomes too high for a GPU, crypto miners lose interest and dump off their old cards in lieu of faster and more efficient cards.']"
Alcohol Content of One Shot of Liquor vs. That Same Liquor in a Mixed Drink,"A standard serving of liquor (distilled spirits) is 1.5 ounces (or a shot glass) and is 40% ABV (alcohol by volume)[1][2][3]. Mixed drinks can contain more than one shot of liquor and may thus have a higher ABV[2][3], and the alcohol content of different mixed drinks can be estimated using a calculator from the NIAAA[3][4]. One 12 oz beer with 5% ABV is equivalent to one shot of 40% ABV alcohol[5].","['- Liquor (distilled spirits) is most often consumed in mixed drinks with 1.5-oz. spirits. Sometimes spirits (vodka, gin, scotch, bourbon, etc.) are mixed with water, club soda, or juice or served “straight” or “on the rocks.” No matter how spirits are consumed, a standard serving (1.5 oz.) of 80 proof (40 percent alcohol by volume) of distilled spirits has the same amount of alcohol as standard servings of beer and wine. So 1.5 oz. x 40 percent alcohol by volume = 0.6 oz. of alcohol/serving.', 'A serving of distilled spirits is about 1.5 ounces, which is the size of a shot glass.1 This standard applies to liquors which are 40% ABV.2 Again, like wine and beer, liquors have different ABVs. Fruit liqueurs typically range from 28% to 32%, gin ranges from 35% to 40%; vodka ranges from 35% to 46%; whiskey, rum and tequila are 40-46%; and cask strength whiskey is 55-60%.3 Mixed drinks, shots, and straight liquors should not contain or be more than one shot to be considered a standard drink.', 'The type of drink also affects the amount of alcohol in a drink. Percentage of alcohol by volume varies widely even in beer. Assuming your beer is automatically 5% alcohol is not always a safe bet, especially when it comes to craft beers. And a mixed drink may be comprised of more than a single shot. In fact, many mixed drinks contain several different types of liquor thus increasing the alcohol content well above a standard drink. Consider a Long Island Ice Tea, which is made with half an ounce of 5 different types of liquor, or a chocolate martini that includes almost 4 ounces of liquor per drink. A single serving of either of these drinks could easily put you over the legal limit to drive or a half a serving if it’s a woman consuming the drink on an empty stomach.', ""Just remember that the amount of liquid in your glass or bottle does not equal the amount of actual alcohol in the drink. Depending on the recipe, you could have one, two, or more standard sized drinks in a single cocktail. You can check the alcohol content of different mixed drinks using this handy calculator from the NIAAA, calculator, but you'll still get a rough estimate only since it cannot take all factors into account."", 'According to science one 12 oz (354 ml) beer with 5% ABV equals one shot of 40% ABV alcohol because they contain the same amount of ethanol.']"
Why do people get more upset about abuse to animals than they do abuse to humans?,"People may feel more empathy and increased reactivity to media reports of violence against animals than to reports of human violence[4], because the focus is on perpetrators rather than the narratives of victims as individuals[4]. Additionally, abusers often target the powerless, and animals are more vulnerable than humans, so crimes against animals, spouses, children, and the elderly often go hand in hand[3]. People may also be more emotionally affected by stories of animal suffering due to the relative lack of ambivalence in human-animal relationships[4][5]. Furthermore, in a study done by Arnold Arluke and Jack Levin of Northeastern University, students were found to be most upset by the stories about the infant, followed by the puppy, then the adult dog, and, finally, the adult human[2].","['When an animal is abused, a chain reaction begins in our community. Not only does an innocent animal get injured, but the person who commits the offense often falls into a cycle that could ultimately result in violence against other people. The evidence of a link between cruelty to animals and violence toward humans is compelling. In fact, people who abuse animals are five times more likely to commit violent crime.', 'The short answer is that it depends on which animals and which people. The sympathy people feel depends on their perceived innocence of the victim. In a paper forthcoming in the journal Society & Animals, Arnold Arluke, Jack Levin, and I examine the assumption that people are more concerned about the suffering of animals than of people. Arnie and Jack conducted research on this at Northeastern University. They had 240 students read one of four hypothetical stories, allegedly from the Boston Globe. The accounts were the same, but the victims were either a puppy, an adult dog, a human infant, or a human adult. After reading the fictitious article, students rated the degree of sympathy they felt on a 15-point scale. They were most upset by the stories about the infant, followed by the puppy, then the adult dog, and, finally, the adult human.', 'Because abusers target the powerless, crimes against animals, spouses, children, and the elderly often go hand in hand. Children who abuse animals may be repeating a lesson learned at home; like their parents, they are reacting to anger or frustration with violence. Their violence is directed at the only individual in the family who is more vulnerable than they are: an animal. Professor Frank R. Ascione of the University of Denver Graduate School of Social Work says, “The research is pretty clear that there are connections between animal abuse and domestic violence and child abuse.”14', 'There is research to support that some people may feel more empathy and increased reactivity to media reports of violence against animals than to reports of human violence. Sociologists Arnold Arluke and Jack Levin of Northeastern University did a study of this recently. They suggest that we may be desensitized to stories of human violence, but more specifically that in media reports the focus is on perpetrators rather than the narratives of victims as individuals, and this may also be a factor in why people tend to respond more strongly to media reports of animal victims, such as the killing of Marius, the 18-month-old giraffe, at the Copenhagen Zoo or, most recently, the killing of Cecil the Lion in Zimbabwe. Whether human or animal, humans tend to feel greater empathy when they are relating to an individual rather than to a group.', 'One reason for those occasions when people are more moved by animal suffering than human suffering is the relative lack of ambivalence in human-animal relationships: my dog rarely talks back, although she often clearly expresses her reactions and anticipations. She is also more unquestioning in her loyalty, although the loyalty is readily transferred to other individuals.']"
Meat (as one example) Causing Cancer,"Eating red and processed meats may increase the risk of certain types of cancer[3][4]. The World Health Organization has classified processed meats including ham, bacon, salami and frankfurts as a Group 1 carcinogen (known to cause cancer)[4]. Fresh red meat such as beef, lamb, veal and pork may also cause cancer, but this may in part be linked to the ways such meats are typically cooked, such as grilling, frying, broiling and other high-temperature cooking methods which can create cancer-promoting chemicals[1]. It is thought that preservatives such as nitrates and nitrites that are added to processed meats can produce compounds that damage DNA[2], and chemicals that are formed when red meat is cooked at high temperatures can cause the accumulation of mutations that lead to cancer[2]. However, there is not enough information to say whether higher or lower cancer risks are related to eating any particular type of red meat or processed meat[3]. No, processed meat has been classified in the same category as causes of cancer such as tobacco smoking and asbestos, but this does NOT mean that they are all equally dangerous[5].","['Fresh red meat such as beef, lamb, veal and pork may also cause cancer, but the World Health Organization says this may in part be linked to the ways such meats are typically cooked.

Do massive fires contribute to climate change like emissions and pollution?,"Yes, massive fires contribute to climate change, like emissions and pollution. Wildfires release carbon emissions that affect climate and drive climate change-related events that contribute to even more wildfires, which release huge quantities of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere[2]. This process only compounds on itself, as the fires release more carbon dioxide, which acts as a greenhouse gas and can exacerbate climate change, and the fires also destroy the trees that help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere[5].","['That’s not to say that climate change is the only thing driving massive wildfires, nor is greenhouse gas release the only consequence. People, specifically European colonizers in North America, have created and perpetuated conditions that increase the risk of large, severe fires. We are just one of many species that suffer from the consequences.', 'Wildfires release carbon emissions that affect climate and drive climate change-related events that contribute to even more wildfires. The specific type of emissions they produce is determined by what they burn and how complete the combustion process is. The largest amounts of carbon emitted are in the form of carbon dioxide - a powerful greenhouse gas - and carbon monoxide. The quantity of each gas depends on whether a fire is flaming or smoldering. Dry fuels combust more easily and are more likely to be flaming.', 'As a driver of climate change, wildfires release huge quantities of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. In British Columbia, extreme fire years in 2017 and 2018 each produced three times more greenhouse gases than all other sectors of the province combined. While trees can and do regrow after fire, building back carbon takes time, which is precisely what we lack in the fight against climate change.', 'There have always been big wildfires, since long before humans began profoundly altering the climate by burning fossil fuels. Those historical emissions are part of the planet’s natural carbon cycle. But human activities, including firefighting practices, are resulting in bigger, more intense fires, and their emissions could become a bigger contributor to global warming.', 'This process only compounds on itself — as fires burn and release more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which acts as a greenhouse gas and can exacerbate climate change, the fires also destroy the trees that help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.']"
"What is the purpose of record companies nowadays, with easy internet dissemination of music?","Record companies nowadays are essential for the marketing and promotion of music. They have consolidated some earlier roles, such as ensuring that the music is present on various online music distribution services, that it is played on relevant radio programmes, and that it obtains appropriate press coverage[1]. They are also responsible for the process of getting recorded music to the consumer, which used to involve partnering with wholesaler logistics distribution companies and pressing factories[4]. Today, distribution is much simpler, as it can be as easy as sending an email with a WAV file attachment, along with the accompanying metadata[5]. Additionally, record companies are also responsible for curating music and helping consumers find music they are likely to enjoy[1].","['To adapt to the digital era, record labels have consolidated some earlier roles and acquired others. For example, record labels are essential for the marketing and promotion of music. Indeed, given the mass dissemination of works over the internet, consumers face an overabundance of choices and there are indications that consumers increasingly want to be told what music they are likely to enjoy, without actually searching for it. To do so, record labels play a crucial role in ensuring that the music is present on various online music distribution services, that it is played on relevant radio programmes, and that it obtains appropriate press coverage. These roles will become increasingly important if the licensing of online music is simplified, resulting in the entry of new platforms in the market.', 'But since the internet revolution in the 1990s, this has changed. Digital technology now allows content to flow between computers without a physical medium. And while the large record companies still have a vast network of distribution resources at their disposal, it is much easier for individuals to share content over the internet. This has caused a few fundamental shifts in music distribution:', 'The access to information brought by the Internet creates an immense potential of information exchange between different places, which promotes cultural exchanges never seen before. Today, a young man can carry more music in his pocket than his parents had at home when they were the same age. But the same tool that provides unrestricted access also opens the way to massive dissemination of music. Big record companies are still stronger than small local forces, which results in musical influences in big urban centres being similar all over the planet. The potential for research is huge, but people still tend to concentrate on a few products. What could be unlimited listening of infinite different artists becomes, most of the time, infinite listening of a few similar artists.', 'Put simply, distribution is the process of getting recorded music to the consumer. In the past, record labels partnered with wholesaler logistics distribution companies and pressing factories for this task. These companies would ensure that records were manufactured and then made available in brick and mortar retail outlets nationwide and around the world. Record labels would then market and promote the record, attempting to get people into the stores to buy it. In the early days of the modern music industry, record deals were the holy grail for artists because record labels had the infrastructure and resources to make music as widely available as possible. These resources were not readily available to individual musicians creating recordings on their own.', 'Because the way people consume recorded music is changing, the distribution industry is too. The basic act of distributing music is much more simple today; it can be as easy as sending an email with a WAV file attachment, along with the accompanying metadata. Because of this, music companies are shifting their business models to include distribution in the services that they offer. A key example is Spotify, which is testing a method of letting creators upload directly to the site. They are also testing a feature allowing artists to submit their own songs for playlist placements (typically the job of a label or distributor). Spotify has also offered “preferential platform access” to artists signed up with the distributor Distrokid, another interesting development in this sector of the business.']"
"Why is Japan allowed to hunt for whales, while other nations are not?","Japan is allowed to hunt for whales while other nations are not because Japan has departed from the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and fishes only inside its exclusive economic zone, and it has also complied with the IWC’s rigid regulations for resource assessment. Japan also argues that hunting and eating whales are part of its culture[2]. Furthermore, Japan has stipulated that it will only kill whales if non-lethal methods of data collection and biopsy sampling fail to meet the plan's objectives[3], and the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) has declared that information on the number of Antarctic minke whales is ""data deficient""[3]. Despite the International Court of Justice ruling in 2014 that Japan must revoke any extant authorization, permit or licence to kill, take or treat whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary and refrain from granting any further permits[4], Japan has continued whale hunting in the Antarctic in 2015 and has resumed hunting minke whales this week in defiance of an international moratorium[4][5].","['In the end, the realization that the commercial hunting moratorium would never be lifted prompted Japan to depart from the IWC.

Why do animals try to have sex with other species?,"There are several possible explanations for why animals may try to have sex with other species. One is that in captivity, animals may have decreased aggression and increased sexual receptivity, making them more likely to mate with members of other species. Another explanation is that animals may get confused and see qualities they naturally seek in a mate in another species[2]. It is also unlikely that animals engage in interspecies sex because they are short of a mate[2][3]. It can also be a way of learning to copulate[3], or a mysterious matter[4].","['Some animals opportunistically mate with individuals of another species. This is more commonly observed in domesticated species and animals in captivity, possibly because captivity is associated with a decrease in aggression and an increase in sexual receptivity. Nevertheless, animals in the wild have been observed to attempt sexual activity with other species. It is mostly documented among species that belong to the same genus, but sometimes occurs between species of distant taxa. Alfred Kinsey cites reports of sexual activity involving a female eland with an ostrich, a male dog with a chicken, a male monkey with a snake, and a female chimpanzee with a cat.', 'Interspecies sexuality is more common in species that are similar to one another because it makes more sense; these animals are more likely to get confused, or to see the qualities they naturally seek in a mate showcased rather inconveniently in the member of another species. It’s a little tougher to guess the reasoning (or lack thereof) behind the mating of more disparate creatures.', 'Other explanations include the argument that the behaviour is a way of learning to copulate, the scientists said, but that is unlikely given that they are social animals and can learn from one another. It’s also unlikely that they would have sex with them because they were short of a mate – since in that case they tend either to masturbate or show homosexual behaviour.', 'Sex between different species—also called ""misdirected mating"" or ""reproductive interference""—is rare but not unheard of in the animal realm. Besides seals, types of dolphin, bird and big cat have been known to engage in various types of sexual activity with other species. Still, it\'s a pretty mysterious matter.', 'Even if you’re uncomfortable with the idea, there are a lot of animal sexual shenanigans in the world.

With public water does it really matter if I conserve water at the sink and shower faucet? Won't it just re-enter the water supply?,"Yes, it does matter if you conserve water at the sink and shower faucet, even if it is public water. Water that goes down the drain doesn't get destroyed, it just moves on to the next part of the water cycle and eventually makes its way back for us to use again[1]. However, fresh water is becoming increasingly scarce[4], so conserving water is important in order to reduce our impact on the environment[4]. Simple ways to conserve water include taking shorter showers and installing water-efficient products like WaterSense labeled faucet aerators[5].","['Parents, city officials, and environmentalists seem to be often telling us, ""Don\'t waste water!"" and ""Conserve water!"". By these statements they typically mean that we shouldn\'t leave the faucet on needlessly, should fix all the plumbing leaks right away, and should only use water sparingly. At the same time, our science teachers tell us that all of the water on the earth is part of an ongoing global water cycle. They tell us that water that goes down the drain does not get destroyed. Rather, it just moves on to the ocean and on to the next part of the water cycle. There seems to be a contradiction between these two positions. How can we ""waste"" water, if it just continues on in the water cycle and inevitably makes its way back for us to use again?', ""That is why it's imperative to recollect to save energy and water in your home.

If corn comes out the same way it goes in how do we gain nutrients.,"Even though it may appear that corn passes through the digestive system undigested, the body does absorb the internal nutrients[1]. The outer shell of a corn kernel remains intact as the nutrients are absorbed by the body, and humans lack the enzyme needed to break down cellulose, which is the outer shell of the kernel[4]. To unlock the nutrients inside, the outer coat of the kernel needs to be broken through mashing, cooking or chewing[4]. The success of this process depends on some seeds remaining viable after they pass through the digestive system. When moisture causes the kernel to swell and break through the outer coat, a new stalk of corn can then develop[5].","['It probably happened when you were just a kid — the first time you noticed that corn looks remarkably similar passing out of your body as it did going in. Although it appears that corn passes through your gastrointestinal system undigested, your body does absorb the internal nutrients.', ""While it might not seem like your body digests corn, it's only the outer shell that stays intact as the nutrients are absorbed by your body."", ""Humans lack the enzyme needed to break down cellulose. Basically, this means that the corn's hull (or empty sleeve) comes out the same color and form as when it went down your esophagus. In the process, these empty sleeves are being packed with the other things your body decided to discard today–in other words, more poop."", 'Our body has enzymes to digest the contents of the corn kernel, but to work, they need access. The fibrous outer coat of a kernel must be broken through mashing, cooking or chewing for the digestive system to be able to have its way with this whole food. There are different varieties of corn, and those used as animal feed tend to have a tougher outer coat. This provides more resistance to the grinding and chewing animals employ during feeding. The corn varieties used in our diets are more tender and flavorful. This being said, however, the key is to give your meal of corn a good chew to unlock the nutrients inside.', 'ANSWER: Corn is a healthful and digestible whole food. Each kernel of corn is a seed and has a tough outer shell, called the pericarp, to protect it from the elements. The germ is the nutrient-rich live part of the seed, and the endosperm is the starch that provides food for the sprouting plant. The structure of a kernel of corn has important implications for seed distribution. Corn, like many other plants, relies on birds and animals to eat the seeds and carry them to new locations where they can be deposited. The success of this process depends on some seeds’ remaining viable after they pass through the digestive system. A new stalk of corn can then develop when moisture causes the kernel to swell and break through the outer coat.']"
How does cheese work?,"Cheese is made by boiling milk and adding an acid such as vinegar, which causes the milk to curdle and the whey to be removed[1]. Cheese is made up of water, sugar (lactose), proteins (casein and whey), and fat[2]. Cheese is fundamentally about decomposition, as bacteria and fungi break down milk fats and proteins to make cheese creamy and give it flavor[3]. Cheesemakers cause the process of curdling to take place in a controlled way[4]. The bacteria and fungi in cheese also cooperate, with yeasts eating the lactic acid produced by the LABs and returning the favor by manufacturing vitamins for them[5].","['These cheeses are made by boiling milk and directly adding an acid such as vinegar. The acid causes the milk to curdle almost instantaneously. Next, the curd is strained to remove the whey. A final compression helps the curds to stick together and the cheese is pretty much ready to use.', 'Cheese starts out as milk. Most of that milk is made up of water with about 5% each of sugar (lactose), proteins (casein and whey), and fat. The exact composition depends on the animal the milk is from, as well as the time of year, the feed the animal has eaten, and more.', 'By now you might have started to suspect: Cheese is fundamentally about decomposition. Like microbes on a rotten log in the woods, the bacteria and fungi in cheese break down their environment — in this case, the milk fats and proteins. This makes cheeses creamy and gives them flavor.', 'The milk is still liquid milk at this point, so cheesemakers need to start manipulating the texture. The process of curdling the milk can also happen naturally. In fact, some nursing animals, such as calves, piglets or kittens, produce the rennin enzyme in their stomachs to help them digest their mother’s milk. Cheesemakers cause the same process to take place in a controlled way.', 'But cheese microbes also cooperate. For example, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts that eat the lactic acid produced by the LABs return the favor by manufacturing vitamins and other compounds that the LABs need. In a different sort of cooperation, threadlike fungal filaments can act as “roads” for surface bacteria to travel deep into the interior of a cheese, Wolfe’s team has found.']"
Why is lethal injection difficult if Oregon mercy death was easy?,"Lethal injection is difficult compared to Oregon mercy death because it is hard to detect and prove if a person or someone assisting them has used a feeding tube or injection. Also, once the injectable pentobarbital leaves the pharmacy, there is nothing to prevent it from being used through an intravenous line or as a lethal injection, and it is unclear what may happen to the lethal agents that are not taken by the patients who originally request them[3]. In addition, monitoring consciousness in patients who are undergoing euthanasia and have received paralytic agents is difficult and may lead to a cruel death[4]. In contrast, Oregon mercy death involves a single injection of a drug like pentobarbital, which is painless, effective, and does not require the presence of a doctor at the time of ingestion in pill form[5].","['There is at least one documented example in Oregon in which assistance by others in the dying process has been acknowledged. Discussing a case in which a man said he helped his brother-in-law take the prescribed drugs, Dr. Katrina Hedberg said, “[W]e do not know exactly how he helped this person swallow, whether it was putting a feed tube down or whatever, but he was not prosecuted. …” Supporters of the Oregon law allege that assisted suicide is totally voluntary by virtue of the fact that the individual alone must actually ingest the lethal agents, and do so very quickly, before the drugs’ effects stall the process. But if a patient or someone assisting uses a feeding tube or an injection, intravenous or intramuscular, abuse is far more difficult to detect and prove.', 'There are additional troubling aspects of how assisted suicide is practiced in Oregon. One is that there are no monitoring mechanisms or, indeed, controls of any kind once the prescription for lethal drugs has been written. No one knows what may happen to the lethal agents that are not taken by the patients who originally request them, and the Oregon reports have made it clear that some patients have died of other causes. The drugs could be stored over time in private homes or workplaces, with no oversight to protect public safety.', 'Dr. Stevens commented on how bitter a death oral ingestion provides, and he pointed out that in at least one known Oregon case, a feeding tube was used. He observed that since the lethal agent can be administered to a willing person through a feeding tube, it is equally possible to administer it to an unwilling person by the same means. Moreover, once the injectable pentobarbital leaves the pharmacy, there is nothing to prevent it from being used through an intravenous (IV) line, or as a lethal injection. If a patient or someone assisting appears to have used a feeding tube or an injection, abuse is far more difficult to detect and prove.', 'Sinmyee et al.26 express concern that monitoring consciousness in patients who are undergoing euthanasia and have received paralytic agents is difficult and, unless properly monitored, ‘there is a risk that vulnerable citizens may be killed by suboptimal, or even cruel, means’. This is of particular concern as opponents of lethal injection argue that a majority of executed prisoners show postmortem signs of flash pulmonary oedema, i.e. their lungs are filled with fluid and weigh several times the weight of normal lungs.28 This may be due to toxic drug effects on alveolar basement membrane, allowing rapid fluid ingress. If the person were aware, it has been suggested that the experience of death by lethal injection could be akin to suffocation or drowning.', 'There are less painful drugs that will cause death. For example, experts have suggested pentobarbital, which can be administered in a single injection. Indeed, this is the most common method of euthanizing domesticated animals.89 In Oregon, which has legalized physician-assisted suicide for the terminally ill, state doctors prescribe an overdose of barbiturates like pentobarbital for their dying patients. The state’s medical ethics board determined that an overdose from a long-acting barbiturate was the most humane way to help someone die—it is painless, effective, and does not require the presence of a doctor at the time of ingestion in pill form.90 According to a physician who consulted with Oregon legislators before the passage of the physician-assisted suicide bill in 1994, an overdose from a drug like pentobarbital is “the best death one could give someone who is suffering.”91']"
Why is AIDS so common in (and associated with) the gay community?,"AIDS is so common in (and associated with) the gay community because gay men have been at a greater risk and represented more of the new HIV cases since the epidemic started in the 1980s[2][3]. Moreover, the stigma attached to homosexuality in the medical, governing, law enforcement and ecclesiastical institutions created a barrier to understanding, prevention, and treatment[2]. Additionally, the AIDS epidemic brought people of differing identities together, forming what we know today as the LGBTQ community[4]. Finally, gay men and those with HIV are more likely to suffer from mental health problems than the general population, which can lead to depression, anxiety, and loneliness[5].","['The prevalence of HIV in gay and bisexual communities creates a bit of a vicious cycle: since HIV is more common among men who have sex with men, a gay or bisexual man is much more likely to contract HIV from his partner and, as a result, spread the disease even further to other men.', 'Knowledge is power: If we learned anything in the gay male community during the early days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States, it was that. No one knew what had hit us, and people were dying in huge numbers all around us. The community lost friends, colleagues, and intimate partners. Initially mislabeled ""gay-related immune deficiency"" (GRID), valuable time was lost in responding to the crisis because most felt safe in the belief that they were not at risk. Since early victims were predominantly gay men, the stigma attached to homosexuality in the medical, governing, law enforcement and ecclesiastical institutions became a barrier to understanding, prevention, and treatment.', 'Dr. David: The answer to this question is not about who you are, but it’s more about a numbers game. Since the HIV epidemic started in the 1980s gay men have been at a greater risk and represented more of the new HIV cases that we’ve known in this country and actually internationally as well. In this day and time, gay men still make up about 2/3 of the new HIV diagnosis. So whether you like or not, just because you’re having sex with other men you are going to put yourself in a pool where you’re having a greater chance of getting in contact with HIV. The other part of that is that when you do have sex, anal sex in particular, without a condom it’s going to be more at risk for HIV. So again, the point I would want to make, it’s not because of who you are, it’s not just because you’re gay. It’s because we live in a high HIV prevalent society among gay men and then also because some of the behaviors that we engage in may put us more at risk for HIV.', 'Individuals with AIDS not only struggled to find medical care and treatments, but also endured the menacing effects of socialized stigma surrounding the disease. Enduring and ultimately surviving the AIDS epidemic brought people of differing identities together: lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals formed what we know today as the LGBTQ community.', 'Gay men and, in particular, those with HIV, are more likely to suffer from mental health problems than the general population (King et al., 2003, 2008). From self-completed surveys of major depressive disorder (MDD) in sexually active gay men attending general practices in urban Australia (Mao et al., 2009), it appeared that the rate of MDD among the 195 HIV-positive gay men was significantly higher than that among the 314 HIV-negative gay men (31.8 vs. 20.1%, respectively). MDD was also independently associated with denial and isolation coping strategies, and with less social support. Furthermore, in a study of HIV-positive MSM in New York and San Francisco, participants perceived a “rift” based on HIV status within their gay community that was linked to depression, anxiety and loneliness (Wolitski, Dey, Parsons, & Gomez, 2002).']"

Why killing and eating dolphins is considered to be so much worse than killing and eating cows.,"Killing and eating dolphins is considered to be worse than killing and eating cows because dolphins are a lot more endangered than cows[1].

"Could I selectively breed a particular breed of dog into another breed? For example, could I breed a golden retrievers into a bulldog?","Yes, it is possible to selectively breed a particular breed of dog into another breed. However, it is important to consider the consequences of selectively breeding. Traditional methods of breeding, where only the ""best"" individual is chosen, can narrow the gene pool and increase inbreeding, limiting the ability to improve traits[1]. To avoid this, breeders should consider selecting a subpopulation of the top performing dogs[1][2], which preserves genetic variation and reduces the influence of non-genetic factors. Selective breeding has resulted in iconic canine features, such as a bull dog’s big head and squat body[3], but it has also put purebred dogs at risk for a large number of health problems[5]. To breed better dogs, breeders should take advantage of additive genetic variation and change the way they define ""best"" during selection[4].","['You have no doubt noticed that this method of breeding, where the ""best"" is defined as a subpopulation of individuals instead of a single dog, is not the way dog breeders usually breed. We usually choose to breed only the dog we perceive to be the ""best"", ignoring the possible effects of environment on our assessment of the other apparently-inferior dogs. Doing this, we narrow the gene pool and increase inbreeding every generation, both of which will limit our ability to continue to improve traits. This applies to health as well as physical and behavioral traits. We can\'t ""breed around"" health issues if the necessary genetic variation no longer exists in the population of breeding animals.', 'Note that there is another issue here that breeding in this way addresses. The phenotype of polygenic traits is likely to be a reflection not just of genetics, but also of a roster of non-genetic factors, some of which might be known but most will not. When you select only the ""best"" individual to breed, you are selecting for the combination of genes and environment that produced what you perceive to be best. But you really only want to be selecting based on genes, because only that part of a trait can be inherited. Maybe the fourth ""best"" dog has great genes for the trait you want but was raised in a less than ideal situation. That dog\'s genes will get tossed if you only select the single best animal. By breeding a subpopulation of the top performing dogs, you preserve the genetic variation you need for selection and also reduce the influence of non-genetic factors in your choice.', 'Some of the most iconic canine features, such as a bull dog’s big head and squat body, are the result of selective breeding over many generations. However, adherence to these standards is often detrimental to dogs. Many English bull dogs, for example, are unable to mate without assistance, so breeders must resort to costly artificial insemination. And because these dogs are bred for their large heads, a Caesarean section is required 90 percent of the time, according to several bull dog breeding sites.', 'Can we breed better dogs by taking advantage of additive genetic variation? Yes, by changing the way we define ""best"" during selection. The improvement we can achieve might be significant - in health, in physical traits of importance, in temperament, and many other traits that we care about.', 'In the same way that inbreeding among human populations can increase the frequency of normally rare genes that cause diseases, the selective breeding that created the hundreds of modern dog breeds has put purebred dogs at risk for a large number of health problems, affecting both body and behavior.']"

During WW2 Why didn't the Jews just pretend they weren't Jewish?,"It was difficult for Jews to pretend they weren't Jewish during WW2 due to the widespread antisemitism in Eastern Europe[1].

"How can carnivorous animals eat (animals) raw meat, without getting food poisoning - like humans would?","Carnivorous animals are able to eat raw meat without getting food poisoning, unlike humans, due to their strong stomach acids that are able to break down and kill the dangerous bacteria in meat[2].

"Why do canned beans (kidney, chick peas, etc.) bubble/suds up when I rinse them?","Canned beans bubble and suds up when rinsed because of a process called aquafaba. Aquafaba is the water that is soaked up when rinsing canned or dry beans and other pulses. This water contains starches, proteins, B-vitamins, zinc, and iron that leach into the water, creating aquafaba[3][4]. Aquafaba also contains properties such as gelatizer, emulsifier, and a thickener, which are all harmless[3][4].

Why do we use tick repellent on pets but not on people?,"Tick repellents used on pets generally contain pesticides such as afoxolaner or permethrin, which can be toxic to people if used directly on the skin [4][5]. Tick repellents used on people typically use DEET or picaridin as their primary ingredients, which are much safer for direct application to the skin than the pesticides used on pets [5]. Additionally, tick repellents used on people are usually applied to clothing, rather than directly to the skin, to provide protection [5].","['There are two oral flea and tick control agents we carry for dogs. One is called Nexguard® and is given once per month. The other is called Bravecto® and is given once every three months. The oral flea and tick control agents are a great choice for families with young children. As a mom of four, even though I know the topical treatments are safe, I don’t want the greasy residue on my dogs, my children, or my furniture. For families with kids, this is a very popular option and a much better one than forgoing protection altogether as many have elected to do because of the residue the topical can leave. However, oral products do have a disadvantage—they do not have a repellent effect.', 'Efficacy: For tick repellants, we looked at how long products retain their tick-defying powers before reapplication is necessary and whether their efficacy is affected by the use of additional topical body products like sunscreen. For pesticide-treated clothing, we noted how many washes an item can withstand before its efficacy wears off. And as for furry friends, we took note of which products were best for long- and short-term use.', 'So if these products work so great for Jiggy, Conner, Emma, and Buffy, why do some people find ticks on their pets, even when they’re using a tick preventative? Well, there are lots of reasons and rest assured, it’s rarely due to failure of the product if it’s sold by a veterinarian. If you’re finding ticks on your pet, here are some things to consider:', ""Conventional products for preventing tick bites in pets generally fall into one of two categories. The first are edible medications that poison any ticks that bite your pet, and may contain pesticides such as afoxolaner. The second type is used on the surface of your pet's fur or skin, and includes topical treatments, dusts, shampoos, sprays, and collars. These are designed to keep ticks from biting, and may have pesticides such as permethrin."", 'Active ingredients: According to Molaei, there are generally two types of chemicals that serve as the first line of defense against ticks: repellents, which can be applied directly to the skin, and pesticides, which can be applied to clothing. Our experts say the best topical repellents use either DEET or picaridin as their primary ingredient; when it comes to pesticides, they all recommended clothing treated with permethrin (the same chemical used in delousing shampoos like Nix), which acts as a “tick-killing agent,” according to Dr. Rick Ostfeld, a disease ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies. We also considered natural tick repellants such as lemon eucalyptus oil.']"
What are the obstacles to ballistic transit systems?,"The obstacles to ballistic transit systems include the resistance of a material due to scattering by impurities, defects, and thermal fluctuations of ions[1], the fundamental ballistic conductance which saturates the current of the device[3], and the difficulty of approaching ballistic transport in suspended graphene[3][4]. Additionally, public transit workers have reported struggles to rebuild their work forces due to the increased risk of the virus, as well as harassment and physical assault[5].","[""In mesoscopic physics, ballistic conduction (ballistic transport) is the unimpeded flow (or transport) of charge carriers (usually electrons), or energy-carrying particles, over relatively long distances in a material. In general, the resistivity of a material exists because an electron, while moving inside a medium, is scattered by impurities, defects, thermal fluctuations of ions in a crystalline solid, or, generally, by any freely-moving atom/molecule composing a gas or liquid. Without scattering, electrons simply obey Newton's second law of motion at non-relativistic speeds."", 'Ballistic conduction enables use of quantum mechanical properties of electron wave functions. Ballistic transport is coherent in wave mechanics terms. Phenomena like double-slit interference, spatial resonance (and other optical or microwave-like effects) could be exploited in electronic systems at nanoscale in systems including nanowires and nanotubes.', ""The Landauer–Büttiker formalism holds as long as the carriers are coherent (which means the length of the active channel is less than the phase-breaking mean free path) and the transmission functions can be calculated from Schrödinger's equation or approximated by semiclassical approximations, like the WKB approximation. Therefore, even in the case of a perfect ballistic transport, there is a fundamental ballistic conductance which saturates the current of the device with a resistance of approximately 12.9 kΩ per mode (spin degeneracy included). There is, however, a generalization of the Landauer–Büttiker formalism of transport applicable to time-dependent problems in the presence of dissipation."", '- Du, Xu; Skachko, Ivan; Barker, Anthony; Andrei, Eva Y.

What effects do animals that become extinct have on the world?,"Animals that become extinct have a variety of effects on the world. The loss of iconic wild animals such as rhinos and tigers can lead to diminished biological diversity, fewer ecotourism job opportunities, and the loss of benefits science is only beginning to discover[1]. Extinction also has profound consequences, both tangible and spiritual, such as crop pollination, water purification, and the loss of cultural heritage[2]. Animals become extinct due to a variety of reasons, many of which are caused by human influence[3]. Recent extinctions include a fish, a bat, and an insect[4], and with the rising global temperature and sea levels, half of the plant and animal species in the richest natural areas of the world could suffer local extinction by the end of the century due to climate change[5].","['What will the world look like as iconic wild animals such as rhinos and tigers go extinct?

Are vegetables alive?,"Yes, vegetables are alive.

They are just like flowers who continue to be alive, at least for a while, even after you pluck them and place them in water in a vase, says Janet Braam, lead researcher and professor of biochemistry and cell biology at Rice University, US.

Why can't cats or dogs recognize their young after awhile and will often times even mate with them?,"Cats and dogs do not have the same system of morality as humans and therefore do not have any concept of incest, which is why they do not recognize that mating with their young is unacceptable[1]. Research has shown that cats and dogs recognize their young based on scent cues[2], and even after a long separation, the mother will recognize her offspring[1][5]. However, even if the animal recognizes that the other animal is their parent, they may still attempt to mate with them as they do not have the same social taboos that humans have[1].","['""However, although that answers the initial question (concerning a dog\'s ability to remember his mom after a long separation) it does not tell us how that former puppy, having now reached adulthood, will act around its mother once they are finally reunited. Contrary to the beliefs of our social psychologist here, the fact that a male offspring might try to mate with his mother during their reunion should not be taken as evidence that he has failed to recognize her as his parent. Rather than demonstrating that he is not aware of his familial relationship to his mother it simply demonstrates the fact that dogs do not have the same system of morality that is accepted by people. Specifically it tells us that the concept of incest, although repugnant to humans, is completely alien to dogs. Even if the dog recognizes that the canine that he has encountered is his mother, it just doesn\'t arouse any taboo which might halt his amorous attempts.""', 'The results of these two experiments clearly show that young puppies recognize their own mother and littermates, and it also shows that this recognition is based upon scent cues.', 'Then she added an interesting twist to her argument, saying, ""I am also struck by the fact that there are some behaviors that seem to be incompatible with the idea that adult dogs recognize their mothers. In particular, it seems to me that dogs demonstrate that they lack any recognition of their biological relatives by violating basic social psychological principles. I\'ll give you the example which convinced me. When my dog was about 3 years of age he met his mother again. Although he seemed happy to see her it took less than half an hour before he was trying to mate with her! It seems to me that this is something which he certainly would not do if he recognized her as his mother.""', ""To see whether the offspring still recognize their mothers, the experiment was now revised so that the targeted scent was that of the dog's mother compared to another female dog of the same breed and age. The results were almost the same as in the case of the mothers recognizing their offspring, with 76 percent of the dogs showing a preference for the cloth impregnated with their mother's scent. This was impressive because the puppies had by now grown into adults and had not seen their mother for around two years."", 'The results were quite clear, with 78 percent of the mothers sniffing the cloth containing the scent of her offspring longer than they sniffed the scent of an unfamiliar dog of the same breed, age, and gender. So obviously canine moms recognize their offspring even after they are adults and after a long separation.']"
why does the education system favours memory retention over imagination?,"The education system often favors memory retention over imagination because cognitive psychology research suggests that traditional methods of study, such as rereading texts and drilling practice, are not effective for committing information to memory[3]. Instead, cognitive psychologists suggest activities that require learners to recall information from memory, such as using flash cards[3]. Furthermore, the idea that the mind functions as a whole, including emotions, intentions, metaphors, and the imagination, has become more accepted and it has been demonstrated that we make sense of the world and our experience in narratives and we can recall items in narrative structures better than in logically organized lists[5]. Additionally, imaginative learning involves our emotions[2], and the development of students' imaginations requires them to learn and memorize much and diverse knowledge[1].","[""This principle might seem to run into conflict with that of the previous section. There I seem to be arguing that the imagination is suppressed if students are set to learn lots of knowledge and skills and here I am claiming that the imagination requires the memorization of lots of knowledge and skills to be adequately stimulated. The two principles are consistent when we observe the point made above about the meaningfulness of the knowledge and skills that are to be memorized; ensuring that knowledge and skills are meaningful requires engaging the imagination in the process of learning. How we can go about ensuring this kind of imaginative learning would require much more space than an essay provides (see Egan, 1988, 1990). What it is important to establish here, however, is that the development of students' imaginations will not go forward without their learning and memorizing much and diverse knowledge."", 'The separation of emotion and intellect, I have argued already, has been educationally dysfunctional. We need to recapture Wordsworth\'s sense of imagination as ""Reason in her most exhalted mood"" (The Prelude, XIV, 192), and see the force of Frye\'s observation that ""the combination of emotion and intellect we call imagination"" (1963, p. 57). Taking imagination seriously in education directs us to transcend the intellect/emotion split and perceive both together in all areas of knowledge and all aspects of education. Our emotional lives are tied to our imaginations which are tied to our intellects. Imaginative learning, then, inevitably involves our emotions. Imagination is important to education because it compels us to recognize that forms of teaching and learning that are disconnected from our emotions are educationally barren.', 'Because cognitivists view memory and recall as the key to learning, they are interested in the processes and conditions that enhance memory and recall. According to cognitive psychology research, traditional methods of study, including rereading texts and drilling practice, or the repetition of terms and concepts, are not effective for committing information to memory (Brown et al., 2014). Rather, cognitivists assert that activities that require learners to recall information from memory, sometimes referred to as “retrieval practice,” lead to better memory and ultimately better learning. For example, they suggest that language learners use flash cards to practice vocabulary words, rather than writing the words out over and over or reading and rereading a list of words, because the flash cards force the learner to recall information from memory.', ""So, a focus on the imagination reminds us that the forms of thought in which it is most lacking are also the forms of thought that have been the targets of the greatest educational thinkers. Their programs of education have not been proposed to prevent students being socialized and growing into the conventions of their time and place but have struggled to find ways of making sure that this process is accompanied by one which makes those conventions intellectual servants and not masters. And I am suggesting that today we can best further this aim by stimulating and developing students' imaginations."", 'As it becomes clearer that the mind functions as a whole, and that this whole includes our bodies, then the sense of the mind as an elaborate calculating organ and reason as its calculations becomes increasingly untenable. It becomes clear that rationality is not a set of skills one can train but is rather tied up with all these hitherto neglected attics, basements, and hidden rooms of the mind, in which emotions, intentions, metaphors, and the imagination, cavort. And so it has been rediscovered that we make sense of the world and of our experience in narratives, that we can recall items in narrative structures better than in logically organized lists, that we more profoundly code knowledge in our memories by affective than by logical associations, that young children deal more readily and flexibly with metaphor than do older, schooled children, and so on and on.']"
how long (based on realistic current CO2 emission projections) can we carry on as a civilisation before we irreversibly change Earth's climate putting us on a donward spiral towards extinction?,"Based on realistic current CO2 emission projections, it is estimated that global greenhouse gas emissions must peak before 2025 and be reduced by 43% by 2030 in order to limit global warming to around 1.5°C (2.7°F) [2]. Even if emissions of greenhouse gases were to suddenly stop, it would take many thousands of years for atmospheric CO2 to return to “pre-industrial” levels due to its very slow transfer to the deep ocean and ultimate burial in ocean sediments [1][4], so it is almost inevitable that we will temporarily exceed the temperature threshold.[2]","['If emissions of CO2 stopped altogether, it would take many thousands of years for atmospheric CO2 to return to “pre-industrial” levels due to its very slow transfer to the deep ocean and ultimate burial in ocean sediments. Surface temperatures would stay elevated for at least a thousand years, implying a long-term commitment to a warmer planet due to past and current emissions. Sea level would likely continue to rise for many centuries even after temperature stopped increasing [Figure 9]. Significant cooling would be required to reverse melting of glaciers and the Greenland ice sheet, which formed during past cold climates. The current CO2-induced warming of Earth is therefore essentially irreversible on human timescales. The amount and rate of further warming will depend almost entirely on how much more CO2 humankind emits.', 'In the scenarios we assessed, limiting warming to around 1.5°C (2.7°F) requires global greenhouse gas emissions to peak before 2025 at the latest, and be reduced by 43% by 2030; at the same time, methane would also need to be reduced by about a third. Even if we do this, it is almost inevitable that we will temporarily exceed this temperature threshold but could return to below it by the end of the century.', 'The Future We Choose is a cautionary tale of two futures for the Earth, the first scenario is what would happen if we fail to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and the second scenario considers what the world would look like if the carbon emission goals are met. Figueres and Rivett-Carnac note that for the first time in history we have the capital, the technology, the policies, and the scientific knowledge to understand that we as a society must half our emissions by 2050. Past generations did not have this knowledge and it will be too late for our children, the time to act is now.', 'Figure 9. If global emissions were to suddenly stop, it would take a long time for surface air temperatures and the ocean to begin to cool, because the excess CO2 in the atmosphere would remain there for a long time and would continue to exert a warming effect. Model projections show how atmospheric CO2 concentration (a), surface air temperature (b), and ocean thermal expansion (c) would respond following a scenario of business-as-usual emissions ceasing in 2300 (red), a scenario of aggressive emission reductions, falling close to zero 50 years from now (orange), and two intermediate emissions scenarios (green and blue). The small downward tick in temperature at 2300 is caused by the elimination of emissions of short-lived greenhouse gases, including methane.

"Why do white people have such unusual names ie. Tagg, Scooter, Buck, Apple, Skylar? Where do they come from? Or do their parents just make them up?","White people have unusual names such as Tagg, Scooter, Buck, Apple, and Skylar because their parents may choose to give them names that are considered ""normal"" by society, often due to socioeconomic status or the power dynamics between minority and majority groups. White people may also give their children unique names because of the influence of popular culture and the desire to stand out[3]. However, some people feel that African-Americans should think twice before giving their children unusual or ""black-sounding"" names[5].","['On Twitter, riffing off of the Reddit thread, I mused on this double standard with a comment and a joke. “Seriously, I will take your ‘questions’ about ‘weird’ black names seriously when you make fun of Reince Priebus and Rand Paul,” followed by “White people giving their kids names like Saxby Chambliss and Tagg Romney is a clear sign of cultural pathology.” If names like “DeShawn” and “Shanice” are fair targets for ridicule, then the same should be true for “Saxby” and “Tagg.”', 'But these responses are more than just the angry comments of Twitter racists. They underscore the extent to which our ideas of normality are tied closely to socioeconomic status. If we focus on “weird” African American names in jokes and conversation, it’s because blacks remain at the bottom of America’s racial caste system. “Hunter” is just as unusual as “Malik,” but it’s understood as “normal” because of its association with white men.

Indeed, if the situation were reversed, odds are good there would be plenty of jokes about “dysfunctional” white people who name their children “Geoff.”', 'But black children aren’t the only ones with unusual names.

Why some socialist/communist countries forbid possessing of foreign currencies?,"Possessing foreign currencies can undermine the economic systems of socialist/communist countries. In trade between East European countries themselves, the need to fix lists of exports and imports existed, on both sides, since domestic price labels attached to commodities could not be used as guides for foreign trade transactions with Eastern Europe[1][2]. Foreign trade organizations in these countries bought goods destined for export from domestic producers at domestic list prices and paid for these goods in domestic currency, so that foreign exchange rates did not enter at all into these transactions[4]. Thus, currencies in Eastern Europe differed from most currencies outside Eastern Europe in that they represented a general claim on available goods only for consumer goods, and even then only insofar as they were purchased directly by the consumers[5]. Therefore, some socialist/communist countries forbid possessing of foreign currencies to maintain their economic systems.[3]","['In trade with countries outside Eastern Europe, particularly those with convertible currencies, these lists bound only the East European country. Collectively, the countries with essentially unrestricted foreign trade and convertible currencies represented a practically unlimited market for Soviet foreign trade. Any East European country could obtain on this market the goods it needed and could sell any goods for which there was a demand, without entering into trade agreements predetermining the composition of goods to be exchanged. The situation was quite different in trade between the East European countries themselves, where the need to fix lists of exports and imports existed, on both sides.', 'Domestic price labels attached to commodities in each of the East European countries could not be used as guides for foreign trade transactions with Eastern Europe, even in the absence of foreign trade monopolies, for the same reason that they could not be used in any of these countries by an outsider who had accumulated either currency of one of these countries or convertible currency. In trade within Eastern Europe, these reasons applied on both sides. In economic relations with outside countries, any East European country could benefit from the existence of outside convertible currencies. In trade with one another, this was not possible and could not be achieved either by imputing a gold content to any or to all East European currencies or by minting gold coins.15', 'During the past two years, there has been a renewal of speculation about the possibility of multilateralization of the foreign trade of the communist East European countries1 and about the convertibility of their currencies. This speculation has been occasioned by the economic reforms planned, experimented with, or introduced in these countries. The present paper examines the compatibility of the economic systems in these countries with the conditions necessary to achieve multilateralism and currency convertibility.', 'As mentioned above, the foreign trade organizations bought goods destined for export from domestic producers at domestic list prices and paid for these goods in domestic currency so that foreign exchange rates did not enter at all into these transactions. There is nothing unusual about this—it happens in other types of economies, too. The situation begins to seem unusual as soon as it is realized that the foreign trade organizations sold goods thus obtained at prices (expressed in terms of the foreign trade partner’s currency, a third currency, or a “clearing currency”) which had no causal or uniform relationship to the domestic list prices paid in the domestic currency to domestic producers. To enter into these export transactions, the foreign trade organizations did not need even to be aware of any specific relationship of this kind. Such a state of affairs was a direct consequence of the Soviet planning and pricing methods.', 'It may be noted that currencies in Eastern Europe differed from most currencies outside Eastern Europe not only in their international relationships, but also in their domestic functions. In the East European countries, money represented a general claim on the available goods only for consumer goods, and even then only insofar as they were purchased directly by the consumers.13 In all other respects, money was not quite a universal claim: to obtain a commodity, one needed not only money but also an allocation decision of the planning authorities. Thus, for producers, money resembled a theater ticket or a ration card—it was valid only for a specific service or commodity.']"

Why do pizza places and mom-and-pop Asian food the only places that deliver? Why didn't any other fast food delivery catch on (outside of NYC)?,"Pizza places and mom-and-pop Asian food are the only places that deliver because they typically provide high-quality food and the customer experience is tailored to the individual, unlike fast food chains which typically produce in mass. Additionally, the competitive environment in the delivery market has increased due to specialized delivery apps focusing on a single customer segment or cuisine type[4]. Finally, due to the high costs of last-mile delivery, partnerships with nearby restaurants to develop a ""food hall""-like online market have allowed customers to place a single order that includes items from multiple restaurants, making it easier to get a variety of cuisines[5].","['In the top corner of the map, we can find Dominos; spaced a few blocks from each other, chain businesses line the streets of America.

Interestingly enough, shops in the pizza industry are one of the only types that survive, despite the competitive prices of popular chains, such as Dominos and Pizza Hut. For instance, take Italian bakeries; many have been shutting down throughout the years, due to lower prices from companies that produce in mass, such as Entenmann’s.

Chinatown is empty compared to other neighborhoods like Mission or Divisadero with blocks shut down and outdoor seating that feels kind of European. They’ve become a scene. The largest lines here are for free food being passed out.', 'Adding to this competitive environment, specialized delivery apps focusing on a single customer segment or cuisine type—such as Slice, for pizza, and HungryPanda, for Chinese—have also come to market successfully in recent years.', 'One of the largest costs of last-mile delivery stems from poor route optimization when making multipoint pickups and drop-offs. Partnerships with nearby restaurants could help develop a “food hall”-like online market to improve the customer experience and offer more variety. Solutions such as Toronto’s Kitchen Hub Food Hall allow customers to place a single order that includes items from multiple restaurants. Families that can’t agree on what to have for dinner can include a variety of cuisines, such as burgers, sushi, and stir-fry, on the same order.']"
"if people use less than 10% of the total water in California, then why are we enacting measures against them?","Although only 10% of California's total water is used for urban use, it is important that people use their water wisely because of the ongoing drought and climate change-induced extreme weather. To encourage water conservation, the State Water Resources Control Board has adopted two emergency regulations that prohibit certain wasteful water use practices statewide[5]. Furthermore, two new mandatory water rationing bills have been passed, which will gradually reduce indoor water use over the next 10 years until it reaches 50 gallons per person per day[4]. These measures are being enacted to ensure that California's water supply is used efficiently and sustainably.","['Half of California’s annual water usage is considered environmental water, meaning it flows through protected rivers or supports wetlands in wildland preserves, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. The other 50 percent is for human use — 40 percent for agriculture and 10 percent for urban use, split between indoor (drinking water, showers) and outdoor (lawns, washing cars).', 'So while the new water laws are certainly a concern and again will impact every single Californian with yet another way to wring and squeeze more money out of our pockets the larger threat to our ability to live in California is looming at the next election. Sadly the proposition is not labeled clearly and is yet another hidden lie by the State Attorney Generals Office to fool the uninformed population into voting on a bill supposedly to help “schools” when in fact its a complete lie to confuse and hoodwink the people into voting to repeal the safety net of Prop-13.', 'California, an open borders state that has a minimum of 3.4 million illegal residences who consume trillions of gallons of water now decries a shortage of water, will fine citizens thousands with no intent of addressing the real reason for rationing? Brilliant! Now to address the homeless problem, ban grocery bags and plastic straws', 'Sen. Bob Hertzberg (D-Los Angeles), and Assemblywoman Laura Friedman (D-Glendale), authored two new mandatory water rationing bills. Senate Bill 606, and Assembly Bill 1668, were easily passed along party lines, signed into law, and will gradually keep ratcheting indoor water use down over the next 10 years, until it reaches 50 gallons per person per day. Unlike expanded reservoirs that capture additional new water to meet the current and future water needs of a growing population, Californians will adapt to living water poor. The cost of the new regulatory body, and added level of bureaucracy necessary to enforce these rationing laws, will be passed on to taxpayers. Water rates will continue to rise, and the “use less, pay more” scenario will increase. What’s worse is the actual water savings will be insignificant.', 'As climate change-induced extreme weather continues to disrupt California’s water system, the State Water Resources Control Board has adopted two emergency regulations that prohibit certain wasteful water use practices statewide and encourage water suppliers and Californians to monitor water use more closely while building habits to use water wisely and make conservation a way of life. Local water suppliers may have adopted stricter water conservation measures than the State Water Board’s, so water customers should check with local agencies about their current restrictions.']"
How humans and other animals can have instinctual behaviors from the moment they're born/hatched,"Instinctual behaviors are unlearned behaviors that are shared by all members of a species and are triggered by certain environmental stimuli. This behavior is preprogrammed into the creature's brain and is present from the moment they are born or hatched. Examples of this include a dog shaking after it gets wet, a sea turtle seeking out the ocean after hatching, or a bird migrating before the winter season[4]. Konrad Lorenz famously demonstrated the power of instincts when he was able to get young geese to imprint on him[5].","['Of course, plenty of behavior in both humans and animals is learned after birth. The point is that creatures appear to be initially equipped with some instinctive behaviors, but each individual’s brain is also wired to acquire new skills in response to the special needs of its unique conditions. (Even imprinting has been shown to be reversible.) How this really takes place is still largely a mystery.', 'In the early 1900s, biologists assumed that all animal behavior was learned. Later, those assumptions were shaken by the pioneering work of Konrad Lorenz, who in the 1930s demonstrated that newly hatched geese have an instinct to follow whatever creature is present and moving (called imprinting). Under normal circumstances, this God-given preprogramming helps vulnerable goslings to accept their mother as their natural guide and protector.', 'In other words, the behavior must occur naturally and automatically in all organisms of that species. For example, infants have an innate rooting reflex that leads them to root for and suck on a nipple. This behavior is unlearned and occurs naturally in all human infants.', 'In animals, instincts are inherent tendencies to engage spontaneously in a particular pattern of behavior. Examples of this include a dog shaking after it gets wet, a sea turtle seeking out the ocean after hatching, or a bird migrating before the winter season.', 'Ethologist Konrad Lorenz famously demonstrated the power of instincts when he was able to get young geese to imprint on him. He noted that geese would become attached to the first moving thing they encountered after they hatched, which in most cases would be their mothers. However, by ensuring that he was the first thing the geese encountered, they instead became attached or imprinted, on him.\ufeff\ufeff']"
How do same power predators interact in the food chain?,"In a food chain, same power predators interact by forming a food web. A food web consists of multiple food chains that are intertwined, and usually multiple predator species that feed on a particular prey species, and one predator species usually feeds on multiple prey species[3]. Examples of predator-prey relations include the lion-zebra, bear-salmon, fox-rabbit, and bear-berry, rabbit-lettuce, and grasshopper-leaf interactions[4]. Predation, a ""+/-"" interaction, includes predator-prey, herbivore-plant, and parasite-host interactions and is the prime mover of energy through food chains[5].","['Energy moves up a food chain, starting with plants, then moving up through herbivores, and then carnivores. A fourth group of organisms called decomposers breaks down the organic matter left behind by these other organisms, like dead animals or plants. Organisms within each group gain energy by feeding on the organisms in the group below them on the food chain. The top predator of a food chain is the carnivore within the community that does not have any predators of its own. When the top predator dies, their remains are broken down by decomposers—bacteria and fungi. Decomposers return nutrients back to soil to help restart the food chain.', 'Food web offers an important tool for investigating the ecological interactions that define energy flows and predator-prey relationship (Cain et al. 2008). Figure 1 shows a simplified food web in a desert ecosystem. In this food web, grasshoppers feed on plants; scorpions prey on grasshoppers; kit foxes prey on scorpions. While the food web showed here is a simple one, most feed webs are complex and involve many species with both strong and weak interactions among them (Pimm et al. 1991). For example, the predators of a scorpion in a desert ecosystem might be a golden eagle, an owl, a roadrunner, or a fox.', 'Since a food web is representative of an entire community, it will consist of multiple food chains that are intertwined. There are usually multiple predator species that feed on a particular prey species, and one predator species usually feeds on multiple prey species. The same goes for the relationship between plants and herbivores.', 'There are literally hundreds of examples of predator-prey relations. A few of them are the lion-zebra, bear-salmon, and fox-rabbit. A plant can also be prey. Bears, for example, feed on berries, a rabbit feeds on lettuce, and a grasshopper feeds on leaves.', 'Predation, a ""+/-"" interaction, includes predator-prey, herbivore-plant, and parasite-host interactions. These linkages are the prime movers of energy through food chains and are an important factor in the ecology of populations, determining mortality of prey and birth of new predators. Mathematical models and logic suggests that a coupled system of predator and prey should cycle: predators increase when prey are abundant, prey are driven to low numbers by predation, the predators decline, and the prey recover, ad infinitum. Some simple systems do cycle, particularly those of the boreal forest and tundra, although this no longer seems the rule. In complex systems, alternative prey and multi-way interactions probably dampen simple predator-prey cycles.']"
"What does it mean when a smoothie or other food product lists ""natural flavors"" on the ingredients list?","When a smoothie or other food product lists ""natural flavors"" on the ingredients list, it means that the product contains flavoring agents derived from plants, fruits, vegetables, edible yeast, herbs, bark, bud, root, leaf, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products[3], whose significant function in the food is to provide flavor rather than nutritional value[3]. It also means that the flavor itself is not organic, but it is compliant with organic regulations, such as no synthetic ingredients or GMOs[2]. However, ""natural flavors"" can contain a variety of other ingredients, such as preservatives, stabilizers, and other agents, which are not required to be labeled by the FDA[4], meaning that it is a complete mystery ingredient.[4]","['You may also have noticed that most of the time, ingredients labels indicate that the food is made with natural and artificial flavors.', 'Sometimes you’ll just see “natural flavors” listed on a certified organic product (instead of “Organic Natural Flavors”). This means that the flavor itself is not organic, but it is compliant with organic regulations – such as no synthetic ingredients or GMOs. So, ultimately, these flavors will have a cleaner profile than the average natural flavor in a conventional product.', 'Based on the FDA guidelines CFR – Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, the term natural flavor or natural flavoring means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional. Natural flavors, include the natural essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in subpart A of part 582 of this chapter, and the substances listed in 172.510 of this chapter.', 'The term “flavors” on a package highly misleading. It sounds innocent and is on SO MANY products that we are desensitized to it. Flavor companies own these proprietary formulas… making it near impossible to find out exactly what’s in them. You’d like to think that “natural apple flavor” is just some juice extracted from an apple and inserted into the food. Nope. That “natural apple flavor” needs to preserved and stabilized and has agents added to help it mix well into a product. This is why flavors can contain upwards of 100 ingredients like propylene glycol, polysorbate 80, BHT, BHA… all considered “incidental additives” not required to be labeled by the FDA.

Why can't tyres be recycled into more tyres? I always see tyre graveyards where they are just left to rot or they are burned.,"Tyres cannot be recycled into more tyres because they are made up of a complex mix of materials, including natural and synthetic rubber, fibre and wire, which makes them difficult to process for recycling[3]. Also, they are not biodegradable, so they do not naturally decompose[3]. The two main solutions to this problem are energy recovery, where tyres are burned to generate electricity, or for heat in steelworks or cement kilns[1], and reuse, where tyres are retread and sold on[1][5]. However, there is a public perception issue with retread tyres, as the general public is more sceptical of their safety and quality[5].","['So landfill is a bad idea. Besides, dumping them loses the materials and energy they contain. But since they burn, maybe that gives us an obvious solution – incinerate them to generate electricity, or for heat in steelworks or cement kilns. This is known as ‘energy recovery’, and that is the fate of about half of Europe’s tyres. They’re quite a good fuel, as it happens. They are as energy-dense as coal, and they don’t produce nitrous oxides. Where they displace coal, tyres could arguably be considered a greener option. But they do produce other pollutants, some of which are a health risk. The exact environmental impact of energy recovery depends on how they are burned and what sort of scrubbing technologies are used, but we’re talking about the lesser of two evils here. It’s better than landfill, but we’re only capturing some of the energy in tyres, and the materials are still lost.', 'The easiest and worst thing to do with ELTs is to put them in landfill. Here’s a photo essay from Kuwait, where tyres are piled up in their millions and then buried in the sand. We used to do this in Britain too, but it’s now illegal under EU waste directives. The trouble with tyres in landfill is that they leach toxins into soil and water. In tropical countries they fill with water and become a paradise for breeding mosquitoes, making them a serious health risk. Even if you’re tempted to ignore both of these issues – because you’re dumping them in the desert, say – they’re also dangerous. Tyre dumps are a fire risk, and burning tyres are notoriously hard to deal with. A valley full of 10 million tyres caught fire near Knighton in Wales in 1989. It took months to put the fire out, and then it smouldered until 2004 – an impressive 15 years.', 'Car tyres are a major global waste problem. Collectively we drive 1.5 billion tyres to the end of their useful lives every year. They can be retread and reused up to a point, but not endlessly. And at the end of their usefulness you have a conundrum. End of life tyres (or ELTs) are difficult to process for any kind of recycling, because they’re a complex mix of materials – natural and synthetic rubber, fibre and wire, all in a heavy and unwieldy package. They’re not biodegradeable, so tyres don’t rot down naturally. And every year we use more of them.', 'There are a number of ways to reuse the materials in tyres, and since the EU banned sending tyres to landfill, a whole lot of research and development has gone into it. Lots of new businesses have emerged that treat end of life tyres as a resource. One of the more common is the rubberised surfaces used in playgrounds and running tracks. There are only so many of these in the world though. With mountains of ELTs to get through, we need large scale uses – like road building. Ground up tyres are now regularly used in asphalt, and there are several advantages. Roads with rubber in them have better grip, and they’re 50% quieter. They last three times longer than normal tarmac, and don’t need as much maintenance.', 'In the hierarchy of waste strategies, recycling come after reuse, and many tyres are already retread and sold on. Retreading has been possible for a while, and the technology to do it is better than ever. Unfortunately, public perception of remanufacturing is a problem. 90% of buses and trucks have retread tyres. Taxis and commercial fleets use them. The general public are more sceptical. That’s something that needs to change, as keeping tyres in circulation for longer is one of the simplest ways to reduce the waste mountain. Regulation varies around the world, and nobody wants to drive on inferior tyres, but in Britain retreads have to meet exactly the same standards as new tyres. They should be more common.']"
"How is it some animals seem to be able to communicate complex principles to each other, like Orcas teaching each other special hunting techniques, and that test with Crows not trusting people in masks?","Animals are able to communicate complex principles to each other through instinct, learning and problem-solving. For example, orcas are able to teach each other special hunting techniques, and crows can distinguish between people with dangerous and non-dangerous masks[5]. Animals use their instincts and even learn new behaviors while engaging in play[3], and can perform many different behaviors at the same time to solve problems[4]. Humans can also influence or alter the behavior of some animals, as demonstrated by two projects where humans developed systems that train crows to accomplish a specific task[2].","['- Could we use the ability of animals to learn, and in some cases solve problems, to help conserve them? For example, sometimes animals face new, unfamiliar predators and they have no instinctual defenses.

The examples that follow describe two projects where humans developed systems that train crows to accomplish a specific task. Write down your observations of each system on your Crow Behavior Worksheet.', 'Animals use their instincts and even learn new behaviors while engaging in play. Animal observations can tell you a lot, but often researchers use puzzles to help them understand the behaviors and instincts of the animals they are studying. Researchers may have animals work through a series of problems to gain access to food or to train them for other tasks, for example, search and rescue dogs.', 'Like humans, other animals use a wide variety of behaviors to solve problems. A single animal can perform many different behaviors, sometimes at the same time as one another!', 'When encountering a single face, crows do occasionally scold a person who is not dangerous. It seems safer to cry wolf occasionally rather than ignore a real threat. But when we presented the crows with a choice, their ability to distinguish among people was uncanny. In this experiment two of us approached a crow while we each wore a different mask, one dangerous and the other neutral. As we neared the crow, we diverged in opposite directions for a while, then reconvened, and diverged again. As we paraded back and forth, invariably the crow lit out after the dangerous person, following him and letting the other masked, but harmless, person strut unscathed.']"
Why is the world's current appetite for meat becoming increasingly unsustainable?,"The world's current appetite for meat is becoming increasingly unsustainable for several reasons. As the developing world becomes more prosperous, demand for beef is likely to continue to grow unabated[2]. This creates a challenge to produce enough crop to feed the growing population and livestock[2]. Additionally, the production process for meat generates high levels of greenhouse gases, which contributes to climate change[5]. Finally, meat eaters may be reducing their meat consumption for financial and health reasons[4].","['Writing in The Lancet Planetary Health last year, a panel of climate scientists called on the international community to “declare a timeframe for peak livestock”—the point at which meat production from animals would begin to decline. Yet demand for beef in countries such as China is likely to continue to grow unabated.', 'Appetite for meat is growing as the developing world becomes more prosperous. But meat—especially beef—can be polarizing, on health, environmental, and ethical grounds. Chicken outpaced beef in the U.S. in 2010. Total U.S. meat consumption peaked in the mid-2000s and has declined ever since. Argentina’s famous appetite for beef has fallen because of cholesterol consciousness and economic downturns. In countries where meat is a newly affordable option, animal protein is a boon, not a debate. But by 2050, when the world’s population is expected to surpass nine billion, crop production will need to double to provide feed for livestock as well as direct human consumption.', 'The biggest, most mind-numbing issue of all is the global one: How do we meet demand for meat while protecting biodiversity and fighting climate change? A common argument these days is that people in developed countries need to eat less meat in general, eat chicken instead of beef, and, if they must eat beef, make it grass fed. I’ve come to doubt that the solution is that simple.', 'Are such messages catching on? While global meat consumption shows few signs of slowing, in some regions there are indications of a growing appetite for meat-free options. That’s being reflected by the major retailers: this week, for example, the U.K.’s largest supermarket chain Tesco committed to increasing sales of “meat alternatives” by 300%, along with measures to improve the “availability and affordability” of such products. Sporadic surveys suggest both Britons and Americans are reducing their meat consumption for a variety of reasons, from financial to health.', 'The ethics of killing animals for their meat have been debated for centuries. But in recent years, the looming specter of climate change has given meat eaters an additional dilemma to consider: cattle and dairy farming, climate scientists have warned, is unsustainable, generating high levels of greenhouse gases at every stage of the production process. For many vegetarians and vegans, the climate factor has provided yet another powerful argument for leaving meat behind.']"
"If experimenting on humans is unethical, how are psychology theories, methods, techniques, etc. are proven?","Since experimenting on humans is unethical, psychology theories, methods, techniques, etc. are proven through other methods, such as research on animals, observation, interviews, surveys, and more.

Many of these tests are performed on children, the sick, and mentally disabled individuals, often under the guise of ""medical treatment""[2]. The Nuremberg Medical Trials resulted in the formation of the Nuremberg Code in an effort to prevent such abuses[4].

In either case, it’s easy to ask the question: “What’s ethical when it comes to science?” Then there are the experiments that involve children, animals, and test subjects who are unaware they’re being experimented on.

Do animals have identical twins? What are their litters classified as?,"Animals do have identical twins, although it is rare. The litters they form are classified as siblings, not twins, as the term twin generally refers to humans and other primates, which by and large give birth to a single offspring[5].

how do animals with extremely acute hearing not get bombarded with loud noise all the time.,"Animals with extremely acute hearing have evolved physical adaptations to help them avoid being bombarded with loud noise all the time. For example, cats have developed large, funnel-shaped ears which are mobile and allow them to hear in 'surround sound' and detect the high frequency sounds made by their prey[1]. Additionally, animals have adapted behaviorally to fill an ecological role within a community and their hearing ability often reflects this role[2]. In addition, research has shown that loud sound can cause persistent vaginal estrus, which can affect the estrus cycle of animals[3]. Also, histological data from cats in low-noise environments have found that noise-induced hearing threshold shifts are correlated with loss or damage to the hair cells in cochleas of noise-exposed cats[4]. Lastly, studies have revealed that different species have a wide variety of tolerance to noise levels[5].","['Cats develop their super-sonic hearing at an early age. “Responses to sound are seen by 10 days of age, so cats are very in tune with the sounds happening around them,” says Dr. Amy Learn, a veterinarian with the Veterinary Referral Center in northern Virginia. Having acute hearing is essential for survival in the wild. “Those large, funnel-shaped ears are mobile and allow them to hear in ‘surround sound,’” she says. Since animals that cats prey on, like mice, communicate in high frequency, this makes sense.', ""The effects of noise and sonic booms on animals vary due to the animal's hearing ability, which varies considerably among animal species. Each species has adapted, physically and behaviorally, to fill an ecological role within a community; an animal's hearing ability often reflects this role. Animals rely on hearing to avoid predators, to obtain food, and to communicate with members of their own species and other members of the community."", 'Studies with rats have shown that loud sound can cause persistent vaginal estrus (Gamble 1982). Prolonged vaginal cornification was produced in rats exposed to daily sound stimulus at levels up to 92 dB. Reducing the ambient sound level from 61 dB to 49 dB, 2 minutes prior to exposing animals to a 92-dB bell, significantly increased duration of the estrus cycle. The estrus cycle of mice stressed by exposure to a pure tone at 92 dB for 6 minutes per hour for 6 days, then left in quiet surroundings, returned to normal; however, despite apparent normal pregnancies, the noise-exposed mice had significantly higher preweaning mortality of young, due mainly to a significant reduction in the number of females able to wean their young.', 'Liberman and Beil (1979) compared histological data from domestic cats born and raised in a low-noise environment and cats raised in a noisy laboratory environment. Noise-induced hearing threshold shifts were correlated with loss or damage to the hair cells in cochleas of noise-exposed cats. Cats', ""The literature concerning hearing ability of animals includes studies of hearing mechanisms and determination of hearing thresholds (audiograms), through primarily behavioral responses to various noise levels in laboratory experiments. Knowledge of specific audiograms for even domestic species is scant; however, a number of studies have been conducted since the mid-1970's on the hearing ability of various wildlife species. Comparisons between groups of species within the same habitat have revealed a wide variety of tolerance to noise levels.""]"
How do SeaWorld get their killer whales?,"SeaWorld has not collected a killer whale in over 35 years and the majority of killer whales at SeaWorld were born in their care[2][5]. However, in the past, SeaWorld did collect killer whales from the wild. Over the next decade, around 300 killer whales were netted off the Pacific Northwest coast, and 51 were sold to marine parks across the globe, including SeaWorld. SeaWorld's lead collector, Goldsberry, caught 252 of them, sold 29, and inadvertently killed nine with his nets[3]. In December 2012, SeaWorld claimed ownership of 28 killer whales, including one rescue whale, Morgan, which was collected from the wild in 2010[5].","['Our goal is to help our guests, and the world, explore the wonders around them, and then inspire them to take action to protect wild animals and wild places. SeaWorld’s killer whales are vital to that mission, and while they will be the last generation of killer whales at SeaWorld, they will still be around for decades to come, inspiring millions of guests and people across the globe to take action with us today.', 'SeaWorld hasn’t collected a killer whale in over 35 years. The majority of killer whales at SeaWorld were born in our care. Watch this video to see how our killer whales are assisting scientist with research that can help whales in the wild.', 'Over the next decade, around 300 killer whales were netted off the Pacific Northwest coast, and 51 were sold to marine parks across the globe, in Japan, Australia, the Netherlands, France, and elsewhere.

Our goal is to inspire and educate guests to take action by seeing these magnificent animals up-close to better understand why protecting wildlife and our environment is so critical today.', 'In December 2012, during SeaWorld’s IPO process, it released a prospectus that claimed ownership of 28 killer whales4. At that time, SeaWorld had 21 whales in its three parks in the US and there were seven whales at Loro Parque in Spain – the four whales SeaWorld sent there originally in 2006 (Skyla, Kohana, Tekoa, and Keto), two calves borne to Kohana (Vicky and Adan – Vicky has since died, but was alive at this time), and Morgan. Therefore, SeaWorld was including Morgan in the total of 28 it was claiming under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. While Morgan was a rescue, she was not a stranding (as she remained free swimming until her capture) and therefore she was “collected” from the wild in 2010.']"
Why do ants drop other ants off ledges?,"Ants drop other ants off ledges because they are trying to protect their colonies from intruders. If an injured ant belongs to another nest, they will attack and drag the intruder away from their raiding column. This behavior has been observed in some species of ants where they will launch rescue operations to free fellow ants from certain death, with some even risking being devoured themselves in their attempt to help[2]. This behavior is unique in social insects, as it is not seen in species of ants that move in a column between the nest and food source, as the injured ants can return slowly to the nest without running any risk of predation[4]. Ants also avoid dead ants if danger is still present, or will carry them away to the midden if there is no sign of danger[5].","['However, these ants don’t indiscriminately rescue any ant seeking help. When researchers dropped injured ants when the column set off from the nest to raid a termite colony, the other ants ignored them. Since ants don’t naturally get hurt on their outward journey, the researchers speculate they disregard the injured ants. Besides, even if they were to rescue them, the rescuers would have to scurry against the tide of the column back to the nest, leaving them open to predation. How could ants reason this is an unnatural situation?', 'Helping others is not newly discovered ant behaviour. The larvae of antlions dig little circular pit traps in sand. Any ant that runs over the edge of the pit slips down the slope toward the spiny jaws of the predator. Some species of ants launch rescue operations to free their companions from certain death. Sometimes, they risk being devoured themselves in their attempt to help a fellow ant. Even in experimental conditions, when researchers tied ants with a nylon thread, the captives’ mates tried to free them by biting the thread.', 'The researchers removed two legs, one from each side, of a few healthy ants and dropped them in front of an ant column returning from a hunt. The legions hauled the maimed back to the nest. But if the injured belonged to another nest, they attacked and dragged the intruders away from their raiding column.', 'Such rescue behaviour of injured ants is unique in social insects, say the authors. Since Matabele ants go out in force, raid and return as a column, any ants that lag behind are at high risk. An injured ant of a foraging species, where a column of ants runs between nest and food source like nectar or carrion, can return slowly to the nest without running any risk of predation since it’s surrounded by its mates. In such species, rescue behaviour may not evolve.', 'Ants would avoid dead ants if danger is still present or once those are in the midden. While smelling the pheromones released upon an ant’s death, ants are not always sure what caused it. So, ants will go to investigate. If danger is present, they’ll leave the dead ant behind. If there is no sign of danger, ants would carry their dead off to the midden.']"
The FDA vets and permits the use of preservatives that are pretty much in every single edible item. Yet we read about how they aren't good for our health and degrade our health over time. Shouldn't our health be numero uno? What gives?,"The FDA vets and permits the use of preservatives that are used in most edible items, but these preservatives can potentially be dangerous or toxic[5]. Some preservatives, such as sodium nitrite, may bind with natural stomach and food chemicals to create nitrosamines, which are powerful cancer causing agents[1]. Furthermore, some preservatives are derived from animal products and may be chemically processed and added to the food[2]. While the FDA does deny requests to consider pet food containing ingredients from “dead stock” renderers or from “4-D” animals to be adulteration high risk[3], it is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with these preservatives and to contact the manufacturer to make sure that the food is safe.[2]","[""Pet food industry critics note that many of the ingredients (such as corn syrup and corn gluten meal) used as humectants to prevent oxidation also bind water molecules in such a way that the food actually sticks to the animal's colon and may cause blockage. Blockage of the colon may cause an increased risk of cancer of the colon or rectum. Two-thirds of the pet food manufactured in the United States contains synthetic preservatives added by the manufacturer. Of the remaining third, 90 percent includes ingredients already stabilized by synthetic preservatives. Because most pet food contains large percentages of added fat, a stabilizer is needed to maintain the quality of the food. Sodium nitrite, often used as a coloring agent, fixative, and preservative, has the ability to combine with natural stomach and food chemicals (secondary amends) to create nitrosamines, powerful cancer-causing agents, according to A Consumer's Dictionary of Food Additives."", 'The good news is that the number of options we have today when it comes to commercial pet foods that are free of chemical preservatives are much better than they used to be! Unfortunately, where it gets tricky is being able to distinguish the marketing hype from fact. I was surprised to learn that just because something says “natural flavors” on the label doesn’t mean it’s truly natural. It could be flavoring extracted from animal products that has been chemically processed and added to the food. And if a pet food manufacturer uses a “proprietary” flavoring, they are not required to disclose what’s in it. The only way to know for sure is to contact the manufacturer and ask questions until you are satisfied with the answers.', '“Your request for FDA to consider any pet food/treat manufacturing sourcing ingredients from “dead stock” renderers and/or USDA rejected meat or meat products or “4-D” animals (rendered or otherwise) to be adulteration high risk, requiring frequent FDA inspection and burden of evidence of compliance from the manufacturer, is denied because your petition does not provide sufficient data and information to support this request.”', 'In the spirit of keeping it natural, the same should be said about the preservatives in your pets food. There are good and bad preservatives. With the evolution of food science years, our preservatives have gotten more complex, but unfortunately their biological effects are not yet understood.', 'When the FDA approves a preservative for use, it deems it Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS). Be aware that some preservatives may be dangerous or toxic. And yet foods with these questionable preservatives can still receive the GRAS approval if the total amount of preservative is less than what’s been established as dangerous.']"
"Why is Walmart Evil for developing an efficient business model to pay people less than a living wage, but Uber is Good for doing the same thing?","Walmart is considered evil for their business model of paying people less than a living wage because they are taking advantage of government entitlements and tax payer money, while not providing fair wages or benefits to their employees. Uber, on the other hand, is seen as more good than bad because they are losing money and their competition is forcing them to offer lower prices and reimbursements to their drivers in order to stay in business[2]. Uber is also creating value for customers by subsidizing about 50 percent of the cost of every ride, which most customers don't realize[5]. However, Uber is still criticized for its lack of transparency in the supply chain, its reluctance to recognize workers’ rights, and its low wages and benefits[4].","[""Walmart is not the enemy. They provide goods and services that people want at prices that people can afford. That success under free market competition is as American as apple pie. Walmart may hurt other businesses that are not as competitive, but at the same time, they provide jobs and additional business to the area. If Walmart has an unfair advantage due to tax payer entitlements that the government provides it's under paid workers, that's the peoples and the governments fault. End all the government entitlements, then you will see true free market changes. Smaller business will be more competitive as Walmarts cost of doing business will go up. You can't blame Walmart for taking advantage of the system. Besides the Government loves Walmart because they pay a lot of employment and property taxes. Our laws, rules and regulations actually favor big business and punish small business."", '""It’s losing money, and its competition is forcing it to lose even more money, in order to stay in business. In an effort to stay afloat, Uber’s passing its pain on to drivers, inventing a raft of lower-priced services (UberX, UberPool) and offering lower reimbursements to their drivers. Kalanick’s admission that competition is putting a cap on Uber’s prices–and profits–suggests that Uber’s $69 billion valuation may be excessive and that Uber’s critics may be right about the viability of its business model. The most strident critics maintain that the company will likely implode from its growing losses. Jalopnik’s Ryan Feltonhas been unstinting in his criticism of the company. Leaked financial reports from the company, analyzed by Hubert Horan at Naked Capitalism make a strong case that the company’s investors are subsidizing something like 59 percent of the cost of rides.', 'Still more from your wonderful Walmart (which saves you money, but at what real cost?): <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/2004/06/23/cx_da_0623topnews.html"" rel=\'nofollow\'>http://www.forbes.com/2004/06/23/cx_da_0623topnews.html</a> <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/opinion/07thu1.html?_r=1"" rel=\'nofollow\'>http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/opinion/07thu1.html?_r=1</a> As one former executive with Walmart stated, &quot;Lower prices lead to lower wages, which leads to a lower quality of life!&quot; The fact of the matter, and almost all economists agree, is that Walmart is bad for local economy as well as the national economy through its patently unfair labor practices.', 'This arises when a company is successful at creating value for customers but is less well regarded as an employer, a business partner, or a corporate citizen. Amazon and Walmart have historically enjoyed high levels of customer approval (reflecting their respective commitments to “be Earth’s most customer-centric company” and “saving people money so they can live better”) while regularly being criticized for their record as employers, their perceived reluctance to recognize workers’ rights, and their lack of transparency in the supply chain.', 'Uber’s business model is to subsidize fares and flood streets with taxi-like cars in order to grab market share and eventually market pricing power. Most customers who love Uber don’t realize that the company actually subsidizes about 50 percent of the cost of every ride. So every time a passenger gets into the car, they are only paying half of the actual cost. The other half is paid by Uber’s wealthy venture capital funders.']"
Why do some of the most stunning scientific advances seem to disappear into obscurity?,"There are several reasons why some of the most stunning scientific advances may seem to disappear into obscurity. One reason is that governments and institutions are more likely to fund and support research that is done within an established framework, rather than to invest in more daring and unpredictable research that may lead to unexpected breakthroughs. Another reason is that the public has become increasingly ambivalent about science and technology and even skeptic. This has led to a mistrust of scientists and their work, as well as a lack of understanding and appreciation for the importance of science[3]. In addition, scientists are often seen as a priestly class and are resented for their focus on objectivity and influence on people's lives[4]. Finally, conflicting hypotheses or data, as well as self-deception and fraud, can lead to extended controversies that may overshadow a scientific advance[5].","['To Duriscoe, the loss of the night sky is a profound one. ""I don’t think it’s a coincidence that astronomy is the oldest science,"" he says. ""It’s because people have been looking at these lights in the sky and these comets and planets and wondering what’s going on up there. It’s really stimulating. When you see it for yourself, when you see the real universe for yourself, there’s nothing like that firsthand experience.""', 'We should not underestimate, however, the importance of the much larger number of yeomen in science, who work within a more established framework and who steadily confirm major findings and add solid items. When a startling breakthrough appears, innumerable specific examples are waiting to be explored—and their unexpected variations frequently lead to further insights. The extraordinary flowering of molecular biology depended not only on a few leaders but on the fact that governments had already built up a large cadre of biomedical researchers, who moved into the new field. Government finds it much easier to relate to this major population, doing somewhat predictable work, than to the mavericks who explore unknown territories.', 'In the past two decades the public has become increasingly ambivalent about science and technology—interested in their advances, but also disturbed by finding that they create problems as well as benefits. There are many concerns: the future of the global environment, changes too fast for us to adapt to, too much dependence on the scientists who alone understand this arcane material, and the propensity of science to focus on its own esoteric interests instead of on our most pressing social problems, though, in fact, many of these lie outside its scope. These concerns have encouraged resentment and misunderstandings—in their more extreme manifestations an antiscience movement—and even a broader flight from rationality. Examples include not only the popularity of astrology and of fundamentalist religions but also the persistence of self-help books, as substitutes for scientific medicine, on the best-seller lists.', 'In addition, scientists are resented as a priestly class, influencing all our lives too much, and seen as lacking humanity because of their focus on objectivity. Not only the general public has this sense of alienation from science. In 1959, in The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution, C. P. Snow dramatized the gap between scholars in science and in the humanities (13). In his view science is now an important part of culture, and all educated people should acquire what is now called scientific literacy. Unfortunately, there is little sign of progress toward this goal, and the gap among scholars seems to have widened. Many of our nonscientific colleagues decry the growing impact of scientists, and some seem to exhibit schadenfreude at seeing them now under fire. Intensifying the negative image, television most often depicts scientists as mad or evil—modern Frankensteins.', 'Although most significant advances in science are rapidly accepted, the uncertainties in some areas can lead to extended controversies, occasionally suggesting fraud. Rivals may continue for years to produce conflicting hypotheses or data. Moreover, the passion of a scientist in pursuit of an exciting idea places a strain on his objectivity. He may fail to consider alternative hypotheses, he may unconsciously avoid designing experiments that might threaten the favored hypothesis, he may clutch at straws in the face of decisive contrary evidence, or he may even distort the very process of observation. Such honest self-deception is a much greater source of false information in science than is fraud. The most accomplished scientists have had to be skillful in avoiding these pitfalls.']"
Synthetic meat,"Synthetic meat is a 100% plant-based meat substitute created to have a similar look, taste and texture as beef[1][2]. It is made with proteins (such as beans or peas), fats (coconut or canola oils), carbs (potato starch), and minerals with flavorings, such as beet juice[3]. Synthetic meat is also sometimes known as cultured or cultivated beef, healthy meat, slaughter-free meat, in vitro meat, vat-grown meat, lab-grown meat, cell-based meat, clean meat, and cultivated meat[2][4]. It is created using animal stem cells ethically harvested from cows and grown under ideal conditions in a nutrient-rich cell medium inside bioreactors[2]. It is also beneficial to human health, as it does not require antibiotics or synthetic growth hormones.","['But what is synthetic beef exactly? Often mistakenly grouped synonymously with cultured or cultivated beef, the term refers to 100% plant-based, often vegan-friendly meat substitute created to have a similar look, taste and texture as beef. It tries to come as close as possible to resembling beef in taste and texture, but it ain’t beef.', 'While synthetic beef is produced from 100% plant-based ingredients, cultured, or cultivated meat (also known as lab-grown meat), is created using animal stem cells ethically harvested from cows and grown under ideal conditions in a nutrient-rich cell medium inside bioreactors. The cells grow, multiply and differentiate into muscle and fat cells which then develop into muscle and fat tissue. The process from stem cell to final product is humane as it avoids the need to raise and slaughter animals.', 'Synthetic beef is typically made with proteins (such as beans or peas), fats (coconut or canola oils), carbs (potato starch), and minerals with flavorings, such as beet juice, to create appetizing patties, for example, that sizzle and resemble beef in texture and appearance. One of the industry’s leading synthetic beef producers blends peas, beans, and brown rice with natural fats like coconut oil. Other variations include combinations of soy and potatoes. Synthetic beef products may also include sausages, meatballs, and beef jerky.', 'Besides cultured meat, the terms healthy meat, slaughter-free meat, in vitro meat, vat-grown meat, lab-grown meat, cell-based meat, clean meat, cultivated meat and synthetic meat have been used to describe the product. Artificial meat is occasionally used, although that specific term has multiple definitions.', 'Because cultivated meat producers don’t expect to use antibiotics – or at least large amounts – cultivated meat could also alleviate the antibiotic resistance problem among humans, Kaplan said. Cultivated meat also shouldn’t need synthetic growth hormones, the subject of debate over their potential impact on human health, puberty and cancer. The US Food and Drug Administration maintains that approved synthetic hormones are safe for humans eating meat from treated animals.']"
Why does food smell more when cooked than when not?,"The smell of food is often what creates an initial impression before tasting it. It is thought that we can smell up to 1 trillion scents, so the sense of smell is very important when it comes to food[1]. The smell of food can trigger memories of previous experiences, and can also influence our decision to eat a certain food[2]. In addition, heat is necessary to amplify pleasant smells and flavors[3]. The smell of food, its texture, its color, and its temperature all contribute to the flavor of food[1][4], and the chemistry of food continues even after the cooking is done, which can further enhance the smell.","['Think about what strikes you most when you come home around dinner time. What makes you think you are in for an enjoyable meal, before you even set foot in the kitchen? The aroma of food wafting through the air. In actual fact, it would be more correct to speak in generic terms of “food smells”. Whatever we choose to call it, our example perfectly describes its importance: because, very often, long before we actually see or taste the food, its smell will indicate how good it is. Furthermore, even if it were well presented and tasted wonderful, we would certainly not be tempted to eat nasty smelling food. If we consider that, on average, we breathe about 23,000 times a day, shifting over 130 cubic meters of air, we realise that the sense of smell is a particularly important issue for any fine food enthusiast.', 'The obvious answer is a combination of both, but is smell not used more during typical meal experiences? If we can reportedly smell 1 trillion scents, surely this would be a dependable asset to the food industry. The use of scent can also trigger food memories, and a smell can trigger a food decision. If you can smell the scent of Indian food, it could trigger a decision to eat Indian food. You haven’t yet tasted anything, but the smell alone can trigger a memory of a previous experience. So why not somehow pump Indian spice scent all throughout the restaurant in an effort to increase sales?', 'In the course of evolution, man has learned to classify a plethora of very intense tasting experiences. One of the most appreciated is that of caramel but, in actual fact, the real cause of a good smell in any food, is a high temperature. In simple terms, we can say that in many dishes, heat ensures that the amino acids react with some types of sugar to form dicarbonyl which, in their turn, react with other amino acids to extend the reaction. This is how pleasant smells and flavours are amplified.', ""SPEAKER 1: Why do people have different reactions to the same food? One person might love chocolate while another person may find it too sweet. Some people love cheese, but others just think it's nasty. The reason for these differences is due in large part to the taste of food. But there are other factors, too. The smell of food, its texture, its color, and its temperature also contribute to what is generally known as the flavor of food. The combination of all these factors tells us whether food is delicious, good, unpleasant, or downright disgusting."", ""Also, particularly with slow-cooking dishes like casseroles, rich thick sauces or things like dahls and curries the flavour when you turn the heat off isn't as good as you think it should be. The trick with these things is to remember that the chemistry is still going on even after the cooking is done.""]"
Why must I boil my water before cooking anything? Can't I just dump my dumplings into the cold water and just start from there?,"It is important to boil your water before cooking anything because boiling water is more efficient at transferring heat to the food, which helps to cook the food more quickly and evenly. If you dump your dumplings into cold water, it will take longer for the water to reach a boiling temperature and the food will not be cooked properly, resulting in a mushy texture[1]. Additionally, boiling water is necessary for certain cooking processes, such as Dian Shui (点水), which requires you to add cold water to the boiling water three times before the dumplings are fully cooked[3]. Lastly, the type of food you are cooking will also determine whether you should start with boiling water or cold water[1][5].","['When you boil something, you want to efficiently dump heat into it to cook it. If you toss your dumplings or whatever into not yet boiling water, it\'s the same as just soaking it in cool water before you cook it. You can imagine pre-soaking your dumplings/pierogies would just turn the dough into nasty mush. It\'s the same thing with tossing them into water that isn\'t yet hot enough to cook them. Also, once your food is in the water, it\'s soaking up some of the heat, which means the water will take longer to boil. With nothing in the water, the water gets 100% of the heat from the stove, so it will boil more quickly than if you have the mass of the food floating in it. Consequently, dumping food in ""30 seconds before it was going to boil"" can actually result in it soaking in sub-boiling water for a lot longer than 30 seconds.', 'Once your water is boiling comfortably, get your dumplings and plop them into the water. Make sure you’re careful not to splash boiling water on yourself. Use some tongs or chopsticks to gently submerge them into the water.', 'Cooking dumplings in water is very straightforward as long as you know the concept of Dian Shui (点水) meaning “add water”. During the cooking process, you need to add cold water to the boiling water three times before the dumplings are fully cooked. Remember to cover the pot with a lid each time after you add water.', '- You can also try adding 1⁄2 cup (120 mL) of cold water to the pot after the dumplings rise. Wait for the water to boil and the dumplings to float again. Repeat this until they are cooked through. X Research source', 'It all depends on what you are cooking: for example if you are making white stock you can (and probably should) start with cold water which you bring to a quick rolling boil and then reduce to a bare simmer for a long time. If you are making soup and you just need to cook the chicken breast to add to the soup, then start with boiling water. If you are cooking legumes, then again start with cold water. For blanching vegetables, cooking rice, or pasta you should always start with boiling water to avoid the problems mentioned earlier but also avoid overcooking (vegetables) or making mushy dishes (pasta, rice). There is no way to achieve the ""al dente"" feeling of pasta if you start with cold water. For that matter, you also never add cold water say to rice pilaf once it starts cooking. Assume you made a mistake and need to add some water to the pot, it must be boiling hot..']"
Why are only humans not able to eat raw meat?,"Humans are not able to eat raw meat because it would be too difficult to chew and digest[1]. Additionally, cooked meat smells and tastes better and humans don't have time and energy to spend on struggling to bite into and digest raw meat[3]. Additionally, consuming raw meat can be risky due to the potential for parasites, bacteria, and chemical rot, which become more dangerous the longer the flesh has been rotting[4]. Although technically humans can eat raw meat, it is not common as there are only a few communities that practice this[4].","['“If I were to give you a piece of raw goat or game, you would not be able to chew it. It would be like bubblegum—you would just chew and chew and chew,” says Daniel Lieberman, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Humans are the only primates who eat meat in quantity. Our cultural ability to cook makes meat easier to break down and has famously been put forth as the cause of a suite of physical changes in the Homo genus, from smaller teeth, to smaller guts, to reduced jaw muscles.', 'A new study suggests that neither we nor our ancestors were capable of eating raw meat without some form of processing.', 'For humans, eating raw meat is really not in our best interest. Not only does cooked meat smell and taste better, we simply do not have the time and energy to sit around struggling to bite into and then digest raw meat.', 'The second assumption is that we, humans, cannot eat raw meat. This is also untrue. A blue rare steak is functionally raw everywhere but the edges, and steak tartare is literally nothing but raw, spiced beef. It’s not so much that we can’t eat raw meat — as it is, raw meat is quite risky, and for the exact same reasons as for a lion. The major difference between us and a lion is that a lion tends to chow down immediately after the kill; only humans have taken to storing meat for long periods of time, applying the squirrel’s hoarding strategy to flesh. Most problems with meat, from parasites to simple chemical rot, become more dangerous the longer the flesh has been rotting.', 'Technically, humans can eat raw meat. There are still many communities that devour raw meat routinely, but such tribes are few and far between.']"
Please ELI5: Why there is still no resolve to the climate change science debate?,"One of the main reasons why there is still no resolve to the climate change science debate is because it is a complex and contentious policy debate that involves both scientific information and subjective value judgments[1]. It is also difficult to come to an agreement on issues such as what is fair for different nations and peoples, the value of cultural heritage, or non-human species[1]. Additionally, policy deliberations and public debates about climate science are often at odds with the assessments of the relevant subject-matter experts[2], and there is no clear scientific judgment on many of the issues involved[1][3]. Additionally, there is an odd tenor to discussions among climate scientists, policy wonks, and politicians, which may be due to the fact that everyone involved has to dance around the obvious truth, at risk of losing their status and influence[4]. Finally, Republican resistance and a lack of public concern are also factors in why there has been no resolution to the climate change science debate.","['Even setting aside disagreement among experts over the likely consequences—and the inescapable uncertainty that disagreement reveals—climate change represents a difficult risk-management challenge. Policy responses necessarily integrate both scientific information and subjective value judgments. Science can inform us about the climate system and our relationship with it. But it can’t tell us whether to care more about our children and their children or about ourselves. Science can’t decide what is fair for different nations and peoples. It can’t resolve differences of opinion on the value of cultural heritage or nonhuman species. There is no clear path to agreement on any of those issues, and that lack of clarity sets up a complex and contentious policy debate.', 'Policy deliberations and public debates about climate science are often at odds with the assessments of the relevant subject-matter experts. The complexity of the issue increases the potential for nonexperts to be unaware of expert assessments or more prone to believe rhetorical arguments that seem convincing, even when those arguments do not withstand the scrutiny of the expert community.', 'That\'s not really a scientific judgment, though, is it?

We are all, on that score, making educated guesses, and a knowledge of history, politics, and economics will be just as important to that judgment as any knowledge of the physical sciences.', 'There has always been an odd tenor to discussions among climate scientists, policy wonks, and politicians, a passive-aggressive quality, and I think it can be traced to the fact that everyone involved has to dance around the obvious truth, at risk of losing their status and influence.', 'Republican resistance on this issue is one but not the only reason why, in the face of mounting evidence, the public remains lukewarm on this existential issue. The dire warnings, the scientific consensus, and the death toll from unprecedented climate events have failed to move the public very much. For two years now, the number of Americans who say they are “very concerned” about climate change fails to reach 50%, as a look at polling from Quinnipiac illustrates.12']"

Why do lizards go limp after catching them?,"Lizards go limp after being caught because their metabolism is so slow that they don't show signs of illness until a disease has progressed[2]. This can often lead to death from malnutrition and starvation[3]. Additionally, if a lizard stops eating or leaves food after a meal[4], this can be a sign of illness that should not be ignored. Lastly, lizards may go limp when it gets below 45 degrees, as they lose the ability to move their limbs in the cold, causing them to fall from the tree branch.[5]","['Healthy lizards are generally bright-eyed and active, moving around their tanks and, depending on their species, climbing on rocks or branches and basking in sunlight. They will respond to things they see and hear and appear alert, pushing up on all four legs in a ready-to-go posture. Sick lizards, on the other hand, often will stay stationary for hours or may even hide under lizard bedding or other objects in the tank. They may be too weak to push up off their bellies onto their legs, so if they move at all, they slither around like snakes. Any reptile owner who sees this kind of behavior or notices weakness in their pet should have the animal checked out immediately.', 'Since lizards (and generally, all reptiles) have such slow metabolisms, when they get sick, they often do not show signs of illness until a disease has progressed, and sometimes not until it is too late to treat. Therefore, it is critical that reptile owners know what signs to look for to tell that their pet is ill before the animal is too far gone for veterinary therapy.', 'Since many reptiles can literally go months without eating and still stay alive, lizard owners will too often wait to see if their pets will resume eating and regain the weight. As they wait, the pet gets thinner and thinner and less able to fight the illness that is causing their decreased appetite, ultimately leading to death from malnutrition and starvation. If you suspect your lizard is gradually losing weight, don’t wait it out; have him examined by a veterinarian as soon as possible.', 'Lizards generally love to eat. Some lizards, such as iguanas, are herbivores (vegetable and fruit eaters); others, such as leopard geckos, are insectivores (insect eaters) or, like bearded dragons, they can be omnivores (eat insects and vegetables/fruit). Regardless of what the lizard eats, leaving lizard food after a meal can be one of the first signs of illness. Not eating at all—even once—is a sign that cannot be ignored.', 'Arboreal lizards sleep at the end of tree branches because it is harder for predators to reach them there (at least without the lizard noticing the branch shaking). However, when it gets below 45 degrees, lizards get so cold that they lose the ability to move their limbs. Then, if the tree branch moves, they fall to the ground. While the fall may cause the lizard to die, they are usually not dead when they fall. And unless it gets below freezing, they aren’t frozen either.']"
How do animals freeze to death while moving?,"It is scientifically impossible for animals to freeze to death while in motion, regardless of the outside temperature[1]. When temperatures are freezing, animals move to protective shelters or corners, start digging and huddle into ditches underground, or even curl down and sleep if possible[2].

Veterinarians say that the animals actually froze to death while lying down, because their paws are very close together[5].","['According to veterinarians contacted by the Observers, it is scientifically impossible for animals to freeze to death while in motion, regardless of the outside temperature.', 'Dogs, Cats and other animals can in fact freeze to death in severe cold temperatures.

"After the mating session, the female black widow spider eats the male. How is this an evolutionary advantage?","Eating the male after mating provides the female with an evolutionary advantage by ensuring her survival and her ability to reproduce. The female can steal the male's calories, which helps her survive long enough to produce eggs[4]. Plus, the male is more likely to court a well-fed female than a hungry one, which gives the female an advantage in mating[2][5]. Additionally, in the case of the Australian redback, the male offers itself to the female during mating, which increases his chances of passing on genes[5].","['ELI5: After the mating session, the female black widow spider eats the male. How is this an evolutionary advantage?', ""Researchers at Arizona State University did a series of experiments to explore whether male western black widow spiders are picky about what females they court and whether they use web-borne chemicals to make this choice. The researchers took female western black widows and fed half of them well with crickets and left the other half hungry. They let the females weave their webs and placed a male on each female's web to see if he courted her or not. Males courted the well-fed females significantly more than they courted the hungry females. This was apparently for good reason: the well-fed females never once attacked a courting male. In comparison, 71% of the hungry females attacked their male suitor."", ""Evolutionary advantage is qualified by two ends - survival, and reproduction. After fucking with the male, well, reproduction's already covered so the male's useless. While most of us are cool with that, the black widow is gets even more efficient; since the male is already useless, she fucking eats the male for a meal, and that fulfils the survival end of evolution for her because she won't be going hungry now. You might say she manages almost to kill two birds with one stone."", ""After mating, the male is superfluous to that particular female in ensuring that its offspring are made. So by eating the male, the female steals his calories, thus helping her survive long enough to produce the eggs. But it's been shown that males prefer female black widows that look fat, and thus full from a meal, so they can go after multiple females."", 'A. They don’t at least, not with any more enthusiasm or frequency than other arachnids. Like most spiders, the black widow is a web builder, and the females are larger than the males. Also like most spiders, widows are predators that eat only living things. (Hence their much-fussed-about poison, a neurotoxin that can cause mild paralysis in mammals, including some humans.) So if a male comes poking around the web at mating time and his lady is hungry, there’s a chance he’ll provide her with more than sperm. If the male scores a well-fed widow, he’ll probably escape. An exception to this rule: the Australian redback, a member of the black widow genus. The male redback has developed a taste for rough, sacrificial sex, flipping his bare abdomen into the hungry female’s mouth during mating. Researchers at the University of Toronto discovered why: A male who offers himself to his mate scores more time in the sack, increasing his chances of passing on genes.']"
"How do we know that animals, other than humans, can get high off of naturally occurring substances?","We know that animals, other than humans, can get high off of naturally occurring substances from studies that have been conducted in laboratories on animals, which have demonstrated that the rewarding effect of drugs is not dependent on pre-existing conditions, and that exposure to the drug is sufficient to motivate drug-taking behaviour[2]. There are also accounts of wild animals intentionally seeking out mind-altering substances from anecdotes, folklore, and myths[3], as well as investigations into the possibility of wild animal drunkenness[3].","['But how much of this is the result of projecting our own fascination with mind-altering substances onto other animals? Decades of laboratory research has shown that we can easily induce addictive behaviour in animals by making addictive substances easily available to them. But do wild animals really get drunk or high?', ""Animal studies have been crucial in understanding the biology and pathophysiology of drug addiction and substance abuse. In contrast to clinical studies, the subject population can be controlled for variables more easily. Animal models often focus on the ability of the drugs to directly control the animal's behavior, an outcome that is consistent with the behavioral definition of addiction. As mentioned elsewhere in this overview, animal studies have demonstrated that the rewarding effect is not dependent on preexisting conditions; that is, exposure to the drug is sufficient to motivate drug-taking behavior. Self-administration by laboratory animals of drugs abused by humans also supports the concept that drugs act as universal reinforcers. In other words, some of the typical behaviors associated with drug abuse in humans are not necessary for drug reinforcement to occur; rather they involve biologic processes common to mammalian species.11"", 'It\'s a seductive idea, isn\'t it? That other animals are as interested in getting as drunk and high as we are? While there are a few legitimate accounts of wild animals intentionally seeking out mind-altering substances, most such tales are based on legend and hearsay, and others simply have insufficient evidence to understand. Morris, Humphreys, and Reynolds point out that the majority of drunken animal stories are ""anecdotal, mired in folklore and myth"". And in a few cases, it’s possible that people are mistakenly attributing certain movements or temperaments to how humans act when inebriated. Wild animal drunkenness may only exist in the (occasionally tipsy) eye of the beholder.', 'Is it true that elephants, monkeys, dolphins and other animals seek out recreational highs in nature? Jason G Goldman investigates.', ""Most studies of potential carcinogens expose the lab animals to doses that are much higher than common human exposures. This is so that cancer risk can be detected in relatively small groups of animals. It isn’t always clear if the results from animal studies will be the same for people when they are normally exposed to a substance. For example, the effects seen in lab studies with very high doses of a substance may not be the same at much lower doses, or the effects of a substance when it is inhaled may not be the same as if it is applied to the skin. Also, the bodies of lab animals and humans don't always process substances in the same way.""]"
"What do we do with the trash that we remove from the ocean, and how do we prevent it from going back there?","The most effective way to remove trash from the ocean and prevent it from going back there is to implement systemic change, such as banning single-use plastics and substituting them with compostable materials, designing products and packaging with recycling in mind, increasing recycling infrastructure, properly disposing of plastics that can’t be recycled, and reducing the export of waste[2]. Additionally, participating in or organizing local cleanups of beaches and waterways is a direct and rewarding way to help fight ocean plastic pollution[1]. Finally, organizations like Ocean Cleanup are working to reduce the amount of plastic in the ocean through the use of large floating net-like barriers and vessels that separate and package the plastic to be sent to recycling facilities onshore[5].","['Help remove plastics from the ocean and prevent them from getting there in the first place by participating in, or organizing a cleanup of your local beach or waterway. This is one of the most direct and rewarding ways to fight ocean plastic pollution. You can simply go to the beach or waterway and collect plastic waste on your own or with friends or family, or you can join a local organization’s cleanup or an international event like our Global Ocean Cleanup or the International Coastal Cleanup.', 'While cleanup technologies have a role to play in cleaning up ocean plastic, no single solution can effectively reduce ocean plastic. What is required is fundamental and systemic change that includes the banning of single-use plastics in favor of products designed to be recycled or repaired, and more recycling infrastructure. Breaking the Plastic Wave, a Pew Report, identified the measures which, if implemented, could cut annual dumping of plastic into the ocean by 80 percent in 20 years. These include reducing plastic consumption, substituting plastic with compostable materials, designing products and packaging with recycling in mind, increasing recycling, proper disposal of plastics that can’t be recycled, and reducing the export of waste.', 'The most high-profile effort to clean up ocean plastic is being conducted by Ocean Cleanup, a Dutch nonprofit whose goal is to get rid of 90 percent of floating plastic pollution in the ocean. Its first collection system proved ineffective when plastic garbage was able to escape its barriers and a part broke off due to the winds and waves. Its more successful current iteration has removed 220,000 pounds of plastic from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.', 'By taking bold, integrated actions that address pollution across sectors, we can help build a sustainable ocean economy that can expand economic opportunities and improve the health and prosperity of millions of people. But our road to recovery must include the development of a circular economy. The notion that things can be thrown away is a myth. Plastic and other pollutants continue to pollute long after their shelf life is over. We need to ”turn off the tap” and prevent pollution before it happens in the first place.', 'Ocean Cleanup’s system consists of a large floating net-like barrier three meters deep that forms a large U shape which is slowly towed by two ships. The natural flow caused by the movement directs plastic to the central retention zone. Once a week, the two vessels come together to close the barriers, pick up the retention zone, and empty the plastic out onto one of their decks.

"Why there is so much focus on the Zimmerman-Martin trial, and why I should care about it.","The Zimmerman-Martin trial has received so much attention because it has raised many important issues about race, the justice system, and the need for restorative justice and healing in communities after a crime[1]. The trial has also highlighted the uncomfortable truth that racial difference and discomfort can have deadly consequences[4]. Furthermore, the trial has brought attention to the Black Lives Matter movement, which is pushing for greater recognition and protection of the lives of black people[5]. Ultimately, the trial and its implications should be of concern to everyone because it touches on deeply important issues that affect all of us.","['Considering the national focus on the George Zimmerman murder trial, particularly over the past month during the trial and its conclusion with a ""not guilty"" verdict Saturday, this piece, ""Restorative Justice for Trayvon Martin,"" seems particularly relevant.

Yet Zimmerman is only one part of the system that failed Trayvon Martin. Yes, Zimmerman shouldn’t have stalked Martin based on his race. Yes, Zimmerman shouldn’t have continued to follow Martin when the police told him not to. Yes, Zimmerman shouldn’t have engaged Martin in a fight that eventually led to the young man’s death. Zimmerman’s actions were problematic at best, and malicious at worst. But the jury found no compelling evidence that he did not act in accordance with the law.', '""I do not know what restorative justice would look like for Martin’s family or, for that matter, for Zimmerman. This would be up to them to figure out, along with community members who feel personally impacted by what happened and only after they get to the point of really understanding and humanizing one another. What I do know is that our conventional justice system, even at its best, is severely limited in what it offers, and restorative systems provide the best way I have seen thus far for justice, for healing, and for the kind of world where, at least in matters of justice, there really are not a Black America and a White America.', 'The trial of George Zimmerman did not end suspicion, nor did it provide great comfort. While the system worked in that there was public judgment rendered, it did little to quiet concerns regarding our ability to appreciate rather than fear difference. The moral of this story is similar to so many others – the often-deadly consequences of discomfort with racial difference. Nothing will bring back Trayvon Martin, and George Zimmerman will not spend any additional time in jail.', 'The series links Martin\'s death and the trial with the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which soon became a national force.

Why haven't we started domesticating tiny bears?,"It is not possible to domesticate bears due to a variety of factors. Bears are too large and dangerous to domesticate[1][3], and they require too much food than humans can provide[3]. Additionally, bears have not adapted on a genetic level to take on traits that people find valuable and lose ones that they find inconvenient, as other animals have[4]. Even animals closely related to those that have been domesticated, such as the zebra, have not been domesticated due to the complexity of their genetics[5].","['After seeing this video I came to the conclusion that it was a damn shame no one at least tried to domesticate bears.

Maybe, but you’d need a few thousand free years, and probably nine lives, to find out.', 'The Auruch were compatible with domestication because not only were they not as dangerous as other large herbivores, they also weren\'t fast enough like deer or gazelle to run away all the time. Same with the wild goats and sheep that were the ancestors to domestic sheep. So a bear is just way too large and dangerous to domesticate. Not only that, they also weren\'t considered ""Feedable,"" they required too much food than humans could ever provide them. The bears that rely on humans for food tend to end up eating into human supplies, Hank the Tank recently was eating people out of house and home.', 'Short answer: No, there’s no such thing as a domesticated bear. To understand why, it’s important to know what “domesticated” means. Basically, a domesticated animal is a creature that has lived with humans so long that they’ve slowly adapted on a genetic level, taking on traits that people find valuable and losing ones that they find inconvenient. Wolves turned into dogs by becoming cuter, more obedient, and better able to digest a wider variety of foods while losing their wariness of people. Wild aurochs became cattle by shrinking and becoming more apt to live in large groups. Cats…well, they’re still assholes, but you have thousands of years of domestication to thank for them only biting you some of the time.', '- Some animals have been bred for reduced aggression, but the genetics are complex. It does not seem possible to do the same for bears. This is a bigger deal than it seems. The zebra for example has never been domesticated because of this in spite of it being so closely related to the horse and donkey.']"
What do animals hear when music is playing?,"It seems that animals enjoy music, but they appreciate different types than humans do.

why we must eat regularly while many animals do not,"Humans need to eat a variety of foods to meet their nutritional needs and remain in good health[1], whereas animals are able to survive on a very limited range of foods[1][5]. This is because animals have evolved to survive on their specific diets by consuming the organs of their prey which contain vital nutrients[5]. Human beings, on the other hand, have evolved to survive on a limited diet by consuming a variety of foods which provide a balance of nutrients[5]. Furthermore, humans have a longer lifespan than animals and want to lead an active, happy life, so consuming a balanced diet is necessary[5].","['Q Why is it that other animals can thrive on often a very limited range of foods in their diets, but we humans are required to eat such a wide range of foods to remain in good health?', 'Having the right to eat animals does not mean we have to eat animals.

Even if we are superior to animals does that mean we should automatically consider them food, animals perform other tasks for us; companionship, beasts of burden, used in war, as symbols etc', 'Yes, it’s true! It’s not just animals, but humans as well, that can survive on eating very simple, specific diets for the entirety of their lives!

How is agriculture a sustainable process? Wouldn't the land eventually run out of nutrients?,"Sustainable agriculture is a process that seeks to produce food and textiles in a way that is environmentally friendly, ecologically sound, and economically viable. It involves practices like no-tillage farming, agroforestry, and integrated pest management to improve soil quality, reduce water use, and lower pollution levels[3]. It also emphasizes the importance of biodiversity and reducing chemical input for more healthy soils and improved crop performance[1]. It also involves a negotiation process between farmers and other stakeholders in order to solve complex problems about how we grow food and fiber[3]. Sustainable agriculture also focuses on replacing non-renewable resources with agroecologically skilled people[4]. Ultimately, the goal of sustainable agriculture is to meet society’s food and textile needs in the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs[5].","['Soil management is vital for existing farms because agricultural production is increasing globally and land is becoming less available to accommodate this growth. Conventional systems can improve soil quality by practicing sustainable methods like no-tillage farming, agroforestry, and integrated pest management, but sustainable agriculture is the most effective form of food production in terms of maintaining soil conditions. “Establishing trees on agricultural land can help to mitigate many of the negative impacts of agriculture, for example by regulating soil, water and air quality, supporting biodiversity, reducing inputs by natural regulation of pests and more efficient nutrient cycling, and by modifying local and global climates.” (Smith, Pearce, and Wolfe 2012). Again, research shows that an increase in biodiversity and a reduction of chemical input can result in conventional farms with more healthy soils and improved crop performance.', 'In a comparison of conventional and sustainable agriculture there should be several points of focus: production, biodiversity, soil composition / erosion, water use, energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions. The environmental impact and production levels of each method will determine its overall viability as a solution to growing trends. It is necessary to make these comparisons in order to identify the best agricultural method that can sustainably meet the needs of the current population. Although these comparisons are based off of scientific data, there is much more research that needs to be done in order to make a definitive judgment.', 'There are many practices commonly used by people working in sustainable agriculture and sustainable food systems. Growers may use methods to promote soil health, minimize water use, and lower pollution levels on the farm. Consumers and retailers concerned with sustainability can look for “values-based” foods that are grown using methods promoting farmworker wellbeing, that are environmentally friendly, or that strengthen the local economy. And researchers in sustainable agriculture often cross disciplinary lines with their work: combining biology, economics, engineering, chemistry, community development, and many others. However, sustainable agriculture is more than a collection of practices. It is also process of negotiation: a push and pull between the sometimes competing interests of an individual farmer or of people in a community as they work to solve complex problems about how we grow our food and fiber.', '“For decades, US policies, technologies, and economic pressures have tended to ‘deskill’ rural labor. … Production has shifted to larger farms that specialize in two to three crops or in livestock,” they write. “Such ecologically simplified operations rely on repetitive tasks, heavy chemical and fertilizer applications, and large-scale ‘labor saving’ machines. [But] under a model that pursues productivity as the primary goal, neither food security nor sustainability has been achieved, and a critical resource—farmer knowledge—has been eroded. As a result, the single greatest sustainability challenge for agriculture may well be that of replacing non-renewable resources with agroecologically skilled people.”', 'The goal of sustainable agriculture is to meet society’s food and textile needs in the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.']"
"Why is it that in car racing, it's all about the driver, yet in horse racing it's all about the horse?","The main difference between horse racing and car racing is the type of vehicle that is being used. In horse racing, the horse is a living, breathing animal with a personality, while in car racing, the ""vehicle"" is a machine[4]. As a result, the driver in car racing has greater control over the vehicle, and must be able to use skill and strategy to make the most of the machine[3]. In horse racing, however, the jockey or driver must have a trusty bond with their horse and be able to alter its speed and direction in order to win[5].","['Horse racing has a jockey and auto racing a driver which is similar, but they also have two contrasting elements: a horse and a car.', 'The person steering the horse in harness racing is called a “driver,” rather than a “jockey,” which is a term used for professional riders.

In many ways it makes perfect sense to limit the access of the general public to the animals themselves. A car, while no less an impressive piece of power, IS truly a machine. We talk about that a lot in horse racing: that the animals are flesh and blood, and not machines, which makes the analysis of 'what went right' or 'what went wrong' a little more complicated. You can pop the hood on a car and see if something is wrong inside. If a tire goes flat, you know.

How does hunting game help wildlife conservation as some claim it does?,"Hunting game helps wildlife conservation because it generates significant revenue that is later spent on preservation and provides people with jobs[1]. It also helps control prey species, such as deer, elk, and bison, who might otherwise have population explosions due to reduced predator populations[2].

Lastly, hunters contribute more money than non-hunters to wildlife conservation, which is commonly described in positive terms as a “user pays, public benefits” model[5].","['Regardless of your personal attitude, there is no denying that hunting is one of the tools used for wildlife conservation. It generates significant revenue that is later spent on preservation, provides people with jobs, and helps us make up for the environmental issues brought about by human activity.

One, it acts as a funding source for state agencies that help conserve habitat.

Secondly, it helps control prey species (deer, elk, bison) who might otherwise have population explosions due to reduced predator populations (reduced from hunting). Let me touch on the specifics of each of these.', 'Most hunters are conservationists at heart. We care about the natural habitats of our game species because we live to chase them. This means selecting mature animals and passing on easier opportunities. Hunting is not conservation however without our advocacy many species would be worse of than they are now.', 'In response to the nation’s declining wildlife populations, sportsmen began to organize conservation groups and advocate for hunting regulations. “They realized that natural resources aren’t limitless and that they need to be protected for future generations,” DePerno said. “It was a real turning point for conservation, and it’s the reason why a lot of the wildlife that’s hunted today still persists.”', 'Probably the most common reason for claiming that hunting is conservation, and for justifying hunters’ privileged status in wildlife matters, is that hunters contribute more money than non-hunters to wildlife conservation, in what is usually described in positive terms as a “user pays, public benefits” model.

Why do dogs feel the need to fetch a ball after you throw it?,"Dogs often feel the need to fetch a ball after you throw it because it is natural for them to enjoy retrieving things and it also helps to channel their energy and relieve boredom[1][2]. Additionally, the bouncing of the ball adds an additional physical challenge to the game of fetch and can increase their focus and arousal, however, this can lead to an increased risk of injury when their focus is not placed on moving safely[4]. Finally, ball obsession can also be reinforced by the dog's owner, as they may reward the overexcited behavior with throwing the ball back to the dog[4][5].","['Dog, which initially has high energy levels and problems with self-control very often get ball fixations. Guardians try to “run” them, throwing the ball. From the walk, the ball needs to be thrown more often, and the dog is increasingly desperate to fetch it. In this way, not only do we wind the dog more, but we also unconsciously work on its condition. Maybe so it turns out that at the beginning of 5 minutes of throwing the ball will tire your dog, but after a week you will have to throw the ball for half an hour, then an hour etc. In this way you cannot channel his energy, he needs more and more. Therefore, playing ‘fetch the ball’ is not a good idea at all for dog fatigue, a varied walk with elements of obedience and olfactory work will be much better.', ""Dogs love fetch and it's natural for them to enjoy retrieving things you throw.

If another dog comes in to play, your dog may feel a little jealous, but he doesn’t become aggressive.', ""- If the object you're throwing has any bounce to it, this can certainly add an additional physical challenge to the game of fetch. As the ball bounces erratically our dogs will track its movement with fierce focus! Our dogs often have “tunnel vision” when retrieving a ball – all their focus is placed on the trajectory of the ball and not on moving in a safe way. When our dogs are hyper aroused, they’ll be less mindful of their bodies or other potential dangers (i.e. roadways, collisions etc) which can increase their risk of injury. The lack of self-preservation and body focus can result in excessive bends/contortions/slide out's/summersaults and movements that fall outside of how the dog's body should move. Heightened body awareness and strength to effectively control the dog's body in these moments is critical and can help to limit an array of injuries."", 'As with almost all behavior problems, ball obsession is often related to the dog’s upbringing, routine, and lifestyle. If your dog starts to show signs of overexcitement, you’ll keep throwing the ball at him because you think he’s having a good time. However, by doing so, you will be reinforcing the obsessive behavior without knowing it. In a way, you’re sending your dog the message that it’s okay for him to be overexcited and behaving hyperactively by rewarding him with throwing the ball back to him.']"
why does drinking milk before excersizing make me throw up?,"Drinking milk before exercising can make you throw up because it can be difficult to digest prior or during exercise.

What would be the quickest way to make the planet impossible to live on for the majority of species?,"The quickest way to make the planet impossible to live on for the majority of species would be to not take action against climate change.

This would destroy biodiversity and cause immense hardship for human societies worldwide. Microbes are the organisms most likely to be able to survive increasing solar intensity[2]. Protecting half the surface of the Earth as proposed by E.O. Wilson could save 84% of species from extinction[3], but this would not be enough to avert crisis[3]. Organisms that reproduce quickly, such as some insects, would have a better chance of avoiding extinction[5].","['Climate change presents the gravest threat to life on Earth in all of human history. The planet is warming to a degree beyond what many species can handle, altering or eliminating habitat, reducing food sources, causing drought and other species-harming severe weather events, and even directly killing species that simply can’t stand the heat. In fact, scientists predict that if we keep going along our current greenhouse gas emissions trajectory, climate change will cause more than a third of the Earth’s animal and plant species to face extinction by 2050 — and up to 70 percent by the end of the century. Such a catastrophic loss would irreversibly diminish biodiversity, severely disrupt ecosystems, and cause immense hardship for human societies worldwide.', 'Thermophiles (heat-adapted organisms) living in extreme environments like volcanic springs are also likely to be less affected by surface temperature changes.

Why does the conflict in Syria get way more coverage in American media than Yemen does?,"The conflict in Syria generally receives more coverage in American media than Yemen because it has a more compelling narrative for an American audience[4]. The media covers Syria more when there is a strong domestic angle, such as U.S. air strikes or the Trump administration’s travel ban[2]. Additionally, the media tends to frame the conflict in Syria as a debate over whether the U.S. should become militarily involved[3]. In contrast, the narrative of Yemen is harder to spin for an American audience because it is difficult to understand why the U.S. is backing the Saudi Coalition[4]. Additionally, the presence of global key players in the Syrian conflict, such as the US, Britain, France and Russia, and the involvement of regional hegemons in both Syria and Yemen also contributes to more coverage of the Syrian conflict than Yemen[5].","['While Yemen is largely ignored, other international conflicts, such as the one in Syria, do get extensive coverage. This is odd given that the conflicts in Syria and Yemen have many similarities. Both crises stemmed from the uprisings of the Arab Spring. These uprisings soon crumbled into proxy wars, in which powerful states backed opposing factions. Both states host millions of internally displaced citizens and even more in need of humanitarian assistance. However, according to Tyndall report data, there have been 666 minutes of coverage in Syria since 2015, more than seven times that of Yemen. Why? The answer comes down to narratives.', 'More frontline coverage may have made a difference. But journalists would still have had to compete for attention and space on an increasingly crowded news and information landscape. Data tracking U.S. news coverage of Syria highlight that spikes only occurred when there was a strong U.S. domestic angle, such as U.S. air strikes in April 2017 or the Trump administration’s travel ban in January 2017, which targeted Muslim-majority countries including Syria (See Figure 1). Unlike Afghanistan and Iraq, there was no major deployment of U.S. forces in Syria to amplify domestic interest although Special Forces have been on the ground since 2015 to assist Syrian rebel forces in the fight against the IS. It should be noted that other destructive conflicts received even less attention. Figure 2 tracks the very low incidence of reporting on South Sudan, a country described by a senior U.S. official as “a very dangerous place in which we’re seeing atrocities all the time.”56', 'But recent research shows that was not how the media framed the issue in the summer of 2013. A study by the Pew Research Center showed that cable TV networks, ranging along the political spectrum from Fox News to CNN and MSNBC to Al Jazeera America, all devoted “the biggest chunk of Syria coverage to the debate over whether the U.S. should become militarily involved in the conflict.” Stories with a humanitarian focus were highest on Al Jazeera America, but only amounted, in the Pew survey, to 6 percent of coverage. Other research confirms this finding.51', 'The narrative of Yemen is harder to spin for an American audience. The Yemen conflict is complicated, yet it offers no comfortable antagonist for Americans to easily despise without implicating themselves. It is also harder for America to justify their involvement there. While the United States backs the Saudi Coalition in Yemen, it is difficult to understand why. Saudi has vast military power, it is responsible for high civilian death tolls, and it has committed a sizeable list of war crimes in the conflict. The Houthi rebels, on the other hand, unlike ISIS in Syria, have not killed a single American citizen. Even though the Houthis have engaged in multiple human rights abuses, it is still hard explain away the U.S.-armed, Saudi bombings of hospitals, public services, and civilians.', 'Syria and Yemen are both countries in which the aftermath of the Arab Uprisings resulted in the eruption of a domestic conflict into a multiplied proxy war. Since then, many international media channels started reporting on the on-going events that occurred, especially in Syria. In Syria, many global key players started to get involved in the conflict such as the US, Britain, France and Russia. Yemen was marked as an important territory for regional hegemons such as Saudi Arabia and Iran which are involved in a proxy conflict in various countries in the Middle East, two of them being Syria and Yemen. With the emergence of global and regional players as well as international media channels in both conflicts, the correlation between foreign policy making and media is questioned. This thesis aims to examine how foreign policy making and media influence one another by analysing in which way politics in media intertwine in the cases of Syrian and Yemeni crises.']"
"What causes fruits to ripen and what makes them become softer and squishier? Also, is there a purpose to ripening?","Fruits ripen due to the presence of a gaseous plant hormone called ethylene, which flips a switch to trigger the enzymes that cause ripening[1][3]. These enzymes cause the fruits' cell walls to break down, making the fruits softer, and the starch to also break down to sugar, making the fruits sweeter[1][3]. As the fruit ripens, chlorophyll (the green stuff in plants) is broken down and in some cases new pigments are made, the acids that make the fruit sour are broken down, the mealy starches are converted into sugar, hard pectin is softened, and larger molecules are made into smaller ones that then evaporate as aroma[4]. Most of the ripening of fruit comes when the fruit turns its cellulose cell walls into sugar, making the fruit soft and sweet[5]. The purpose of ripening is to make the fruit more appealing to animals, which can carry the fruits and spread the seeds of the original plants to faraway places that the plants could not travel to.[1][3]","['Hi Lola, this is a great question! First, I\'d like to talk about why fruits ripen. As you probably know, unripe fruits are often green, hard, mealy (there is starch present), and odorless. Nobody likes that including wild animals like birds that can potentially carry the fruits and spread the seeds of the original plants to faraway places that the plants could not travel to. So evolutionarily, plants want their fruits to be sweet and tasty. So how do fruits do the ripening after they are no longer attached to the mother trees? Fruits take their cue from a ripening signal, which is a burst of gas called ethylene, also known as the ""fruit-ripening hormone."" This hydrocarbon gas flips a switch to trigger the enzymes that cause ripening. These enzymes cause the fruits\' cell walls to break down, making the fruits softer, and the starch to also break down to sugar, making the fruits sweeter.', 'Bananas hanging on a tree or sitting in the produce section of the grocery store start out green, plenty hard and none too tasty. Over time, of course, they become softer and sweeter. The cause of fruit ripening is a natural form of a chemical synthesized to make PVC (polyvinyl chloride) piping and plastic bags—namely, a gaseous plant hormone called ethylene.', '""Ripeness"" in a fruit refers to several qualities that tend to change together over time. The fruit becomes softer because tough molecules in the skin of the fruit begin to break down. Likewise, fruit tends to become sweeter as bitter molecules are broken down, and long, non-sweet tasting sugars are cleaved into shorter, sweeter sugars. These processes are regulated by several enzymes in the fruit. Enzymes are proteins that can carry out specific tasks in an organism, like converting one molecule into a different type of molecule, and breaking down sugars. These enzymes tend to be activated by ethylene gas - as fruits ripen, they release small amounts of ethylene initially. The fruit can sense the presence of ethylene, which causes it to release more and more ethylene, until the fruit is in full ""ripening mode""!', 'Many things happen as fruit ripens. Unripe fruit is often green, sour, odorless, hard and mealy. The ripening process makes the fruit more appealing – the color of the skin changes as chlorophyll (the green stuff in plants) is broken down and in some cases new pigments are made, the acids that make the fruit sour are broken down, the mealy starches are converted into sugar, hard pectin is softened, and larger molecules are made into smaller ones that then evaporate as aroma. Suddenly, we have a soft, juicy, sweet, fragrant, colorful animal-attractor.', 'Most of the ripening of fruit comes when the fruit turns its cellulose cell walls into sugar, making the fruit soft and sweet. Because a fruit can still do this as long as its cells are alive, it will keep ripening even while off of the tree. Eat it soon, though, because the riper a fruit gets, the sooner fungi will get into it and rot the fruit before you can eat it!']"
Why chocolate is lethal to most animals but humans?,"Chocolate is lethal to most animals but humans because it contains a compound called theobromine, which is toxic to animals at certain doses[3]. Theobromine is readily digested by humans, but it is much more slowly metabolized in animals, and its toxic side effects can last for up to 72 hours[5]. Additionally, chocolate also contains caffeine, which can have deleterious effects on animals[5].","[""Chocolate has a wonderfully seductive chemistry, due in part to a toxic alkaloid called theobromine. It's not terrible for humans, but the compound can be fatal if ingested by other species."", 'Although many people are aware that dogs can’t eat chocolate, it is actually a very common intolerance for most mammals.

Theobromine is toxic to dogs and other animals at certain doses. Chocolate poisoning is a problem that occurs mainly in dogs but also occurs occasionally in cats or other animals.

What happens to road kill? It always seems to just disappear...,"Roadkill is often scavenged by another animal[1][2], and can cause serious damage to a car or people in it if they are large enough[3].

What is the history behind eating eggs?,"Humans and human ancestors have been scavenging and eating animal eggs for millions of years[2][3][5].

How can wild animals eat/tolerate raw meat whereas humans are instructed to avoid it and it can be deadly?,"Wild animals can eat raw meat because of their robust immune system which has evolved to resist the various infections they can contract from the bacteria they’re exposed to through their diet[2]. Additionally, animals eat their prey right after they kill it, so the meat is fresh[3][4]. Additionally, wild animals quite obviously can’t cook their meat[1][3][4].

Can dogs and other animals get mental illnesses like humans can?,"Yes, dogs and other animals can get mental illnesses like humans can. This is supported by evidence from neurobiological and genetic studies[1][3], which suggest that mental illnesses in animals can be triggered by the same factors that cause them in humans, such as the loss of family or companions, loss of freedom, stress, trauma, and abuse[2]. In addition, there have been cases of animals exhibiting symptoms similar to human mental illnesses, such as a Bernese Mountain Dog named Oliver who exhibited extreme fear, anxiety, and compulsions[3]. The recommended treatments for dogs with mental illnesses are also very similar to what a doctor would suggest for a human, such as scheduling a visit with a vet and addressing the mental health with medication and other strategies[4].

That includes the loss of family or companions, loss of freedom, stress, trauma and abuse.""', 'Humans aren’t the only animals to suffer from emotional thunderstorms that make our lives more difficult, and sometimes impossible. Like Charles Darwin, who came to this realization more than a century ago, I believe that nonhuman animals can suffer from mental illnesses that are quite similar to human disorders. I was convinced by the experiences of many creatures I came to know, from Mac to a series of Asian elephants, but none more persuasively than a Bernese Mountain Dog named Oliver that my husband and I adopted. Oliver’s extreme fear, anxiety, and compulsions cracked open my world and prompted me to investigate whether other animals could be mentally ill. This book is the tale of what I found: the story of my own struggle to help Oliver and the journey it inspired, a search to understand what identifying insanity in other animals might tell us about ourselves.', 'In another example of how similar dogs and humans are, the recommended treatments for dogs with mental illnesses are very similar to what a doctor would suggest for a human. Of course, the first thing you should do to help your dog if you think he is mentally ill is to schedule a visit with your vet. A veterinarian can do the very important task of eliminating other physical health issues that could be related to or causing your dog’s mental illness. Your vet will also be able to help you come up with a whole strategy for addressing your dog’s mental health and can prescribe medications to help your dog. Here is a list of other things that can help your dog’s mental health.', 'Identifying mental illness in other creatures and helping them recover also sheds light on our humanity.

Why do so many professional athletes beat their significant others?,"Professional athletes may be more likely to beat their significant others for a variety of reasons. There is pressure for athletes to be in a perfect relationship[1], and they may blame their partner's behavior or their own on sports[2]. Professional athletes are also rarely formally charged with crimes related to domestic violence or sexual assault, which may lead to a sense of being above reproach[3]. In addition, athletes tend to have a ""me-first"" attitude, which can lead to frustration if their will is not accepted by their partner[4]. Lastly, there may be pressure to stay in an unhealthy relationship if it is tied to their athlete status[5].","['At One Love, we often talk about the social and cultural pressures we all face to be in the perfect relationship. For elite athletes, this pressure is only exacerbated. Former college athlete, *Jamie, says “A lot of people would assume that because you are an elite athlete, it should be easy for you to find a significant other.”', 'Another potentially dangerous effect of spending so much time and energy focusing on athletics is the tendency to blame sports for your or your partner’s behavior. Former college athlete, Rachel N. says “I blamed their infidelity on insecurity stemming from a frustrated career. I let it excuse the outbursts of anger. I distracted myself from their intense jealousy of teammates I had a history with, by telling myself it was love.”', 'The research suggests that professional athletes are rarely formally charged with crimes related to domestic violence or sexual assault, even when there is evidence against them. And in the cases where these professional athletes are indicted, they are almost never convicted. If the leagues continue to shape their collective bargaining agreements and/or personal conduct policies based on the results of the justice system, we cannot solve this problem—professional athletes are not punished as harshly or as consistently as their general public counterparts. We value professional athletes for their aggressiveness and brute strength and, without consequence, we have created a class of individuals who are above reproach when these characteristics present outside of the game.', ""So what happens when athletes, who are more predisposed to the me-first attitude, are in what is supposed to be a relationship of equals? If there's a difference of opinion, some of them impose their will. If their will is not accepted by their partner, then perhaps the frustration mounts to the point of becoming physical."", 'If the pressure to be in a relationship is already intense, imagine how difficult it must be to break up with someone when your relationship is tied to your athlete status.

Why do they need to kill horses when they break a leg.,"Horses are euthanized when they break a bone in their limb because they have minimal chance of recovery and suffer extreme pain[1].

"If most voters disagree with corporate lobbying and company funded candidates, then why do we still vote for them?","Corporate lobbying and company funded candidates are still voted for despite the majority of voters disagreeing with them for a variety of reasons. It is often argued that corporations are supporting politicians and legislation that align with their preferred regulatory line and their EESG values, and that corporate lobbying is a necessary part of influencing public policy[2]. It is also argued that corporations are large employers in the communities in which they have material operations, and that they should take pains to ensure their lobbying messages are consistent with their EESG policies to avoid being perceived as hypocritical[3]. However, it is also argued that companies' ""freedom"" to donate to politicians after Citizens United ultimately led to a trap for corporate management, as it forces them to support positions and candidates that their investors, customers, and employees may disfavor[4]. Furthermore, it is argued that corporate political spending cannot reflect the diverse preferences and views of their stakeholders, and that it can even destroy value by suppressing innovation and distracting managers from more pressing tasks[5].","['A CEO may argue that he or she supports only politicians and legislation that hew to the company’s preferred regulatory line, and that it just so happens that those politicians are more likely to be Republican. But often politicians whose views align with a particular corporate interest also take positions that are antithetical to a company’s stated EESG values, which underpin its plan for long-term value creation. And even if a politician’s views aligned perfectly with all the interests of the corporation, shareholders might prefer not to have its treasury dollars spent in this way.', 'Of course, some of the concerns about corporate political spending extend to lobbying as well. If, for example, a corporation lobbies against legislation to address climate change while claiming to be supporting action to address that urgent problem, its leaders will face similar scrutiny. It is understandable and expected that corporations will air their views on public policy issues that directly affect their ability to conduct their business. That understanding should put to rest any fears that if corporations stop giving to politicians, their interests will be ignored by the political process. By any responsible measure, corporate lobbying expenditures swamp those made by organizations that represent workers, consumers, the environment, and other nonbusiness interests.', 'As important, when corporations are large employers that act as good citizens in the communities in which they have material operations, they need not buy support from their congressional delegation or state and local legislators, who have a natural incentive to make sure that businesses of that kind remain in their districts. And as long as corporations take pains to ensure that their lobbying messages are consistent with their EESG policies, the chances of being perceived as hypocritical are minimal.', 'Indeed, companies’ “freedom” to donate to politicians after Citizens United ultimately led to a trap for corporate management. Under prior law, when corporations could not say yes to solicitations for political donations, they were not even asked. They could give through a PAC only, and that arrangement put limits on fundraising and spending. Instead of being forced to support positions and candidates that their investors, customers, and employees disfavored, executives could focus on their core job of running their businesses.', 'Deeper issues lurk beyond hypocrisy. Because political donations are controlled by managers, and because no corporate stakeholders, including shareholders, base their relationship with a company on the expectation that it will use its entrusted capital for political purposes, corporate political spending cannot reflect the diverse preferences and views of those stakeholders. Even the classic justification that corporate donations maximize shareholder wealth is on shaky ground: Emerging evidence suggests that they can destroy value by suppressing innovation and distracting managers from more-pressing tasks.']"
One of the qualifications for a drug to be listed as Schedule 1 is that is has no currently accepted medical use.

what exactly is an algorithm and how is the algorithm for detecting fake news on Facebook failing?,"An algorithm is a set of instructions for a computer to follow to carry out a task.

Can someone please explain Nuclear spin as it relates to an MRI machine?,"Nuclear spin is a property of a nucleus which only nuclei with non-zero spins (I ≠ 0) can absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation and undergo ""resonance"" when placed in a magnetic field[1]. In an MRI machine, nuclear spin is used to create the image via spin-spin relaxation[1][2]. Nuclear spin is denoted by an arrow resembling a vector in classical physics similar to L and has a specific magnitude (½, 1, etc.)[3]. An MRI machine creates a static magnetic field 30 to 60 thousand times stronger than the magnetic field of the earth, which causes hydrogen protons within the patient's body to align to the magnetic field[4]. A 90° pulse of energy is then used to rotate the protons 90°, so the net magnetization is rotated from the z-axis, parallel to Bo, into the xy-plane, and Mz, the magnetization along Bo, is 0[5].","['Unlike macroscopic angular momentum, spin can only be measured discrete integer or half-integer units (0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, 5/2, ...) Protons, neutrons, and electrons all have spin = ½. Although exactly the same property, nuclear spin is traditionally denoted by the letter I, while electron spin is denoted by the letter S. Electron spin has only one value (S = ½, always), but nuclear spin values ranging from I = 0 to I = 8 in ½-unit increments can be found across the entire periodic table. ¹H, the nucleus most commonly used for NMR and MRI, has I = ½, the same spin as the single proton of which it is composed. Only nuclei with non-zero spins (I ≠ 0) can absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation and undergo ""resonance"" when placed in a magnetic field.', ""Another type of relaxation used in MRI is spin-spin relaxation. Because the magnetic field varies, the nuclei's Larmor frequency will vary. Since they spin at different frequencies, the nuclei will gradually end up out of phase, or spin at different times. MRIs use the loss of signal due to the phase-difference between these nuclei to assist in creating the image."", 'In most diagrams, nuclear spin (I) is denoted by an arrow resembling a vector in classical physics similar to L. Like a classical vector, spin does have a specific magnitude (½, 1, etc.). However, its ""direction"" is not so simply defined because it does not behave as a conventional vector under certain rotations. Spin is therefore considered a spinor, an element of a complex vector space governed by rules of advanced group theory.', ""So when the patient is first placed in the static magnetic field that the machine creates, MRI takes advantage of that high prevalence of hydrogen in the body and the magnetic properties of the proton in a hydrogen atom. Hydrogen atoms induce a small magnetic field due to the spin of this atom's proton. Hydrogen protons within the patient's body will then align to the magnetic field which is typically 30 to 60 thousand times stronger than the magnetic field of the earth."", 'The simplest version of an MRI sequence involves a so-called 90° pulse. This pulse of energy is exactly enough to rotate the protons 90°, so the net magnetization is rotate from the z-axis, parallel to Bo, into the xy-plane. At that point, Mz, the magnetization along Bo, is 0.']"
"Why is biodiesel available in so many places, but biogasoline almost unheard of?","Biodiesel is widely available because it can be blended with petroleum-based diesel at any percentage and is compatible with petroleum-diesel engines[1]. In 2005, Congress passed the Renewable Fuel Standard, which required U.S. gasoline manufacturers to include a certain amount of biofuels into the mix of commercial gasoline, leading to the availability of B20 (80-percent petroleum-based diesel and 20-percent biodiesel)[2]. Biodiesel has been produced from a variety of feedstocks, including rapeseed oil, palm oil, and soybean oil, and incentives such as the Biodiesel Mixture Excise Tax Credit and the Biodiesel Income Tax Credit have made it even more available[4]. Additionally, biodiesel can be blended and used in many different concentrations, from B5 (up to 5% biodiesel) to B20 (6% to 20% biodiesel)[5]. Biogasoline, on the other hand, is almost unheard of because it is not required by the Renewable Fuel Standard and there is not as much of an infrastructure for its production.","['FAME can be blended with petroleum-based diesel at any percentage, and those blends are compatible with petroleum-diesel engines (DOE-EERE, 2010). The most popular biodiesel blend in the United States is B20—that is 80-percent petroleum-based diesel and 20-percent biodiesel (NREL, 2005). As of 2010, there were about 650 B20 stations in the United States.', 'In 2005, Congress wanted to take advantage of these benefits, while also reducing dependence on foreign oil and supporting US farmers. They passed the Renewable Fuel Standard, which required U.S. gasoline manufacturers to include a certain amount of biofuels into the mix of commercial gasoline. Today, most gas sold at gas stations includes about 10 percent bioalcohol fuel. This is usually ethanol, which is produced from corn or other vegetable byproducts and is, by far, the most prevalent biofuel in the country.', 'Only small amounts of biodiesel were consumed and produced in the United States until the early 2000s. Since then, U.S. biodiesel consumption and production increased substantially, largely because of the availability over time of various government incentives and requirements to produce, sell, and use biodiesel. In addition to its use in recent years to meet targets for advanced biofuels use under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard Program, important incentives to biodiesel blenders and producers are the Biodiesel Mixture Excise Tax Credit and the Biodiesel Income Tax Credit. In 2020, biodiesel was second to fuel ethanol as the most produced and consumed biofuel in the United States, and accounted for about 11% and 12% of total U.S. biofuels production and consumption respectively.', 'Several countries, mostly in Europe, produce biodiesel from a variety of feedstocks, including rapeseed oil, palm oil, and soybean oil (Reijnders, 2009; de Vries et al., 2010). In the United States, biodiesel is produced mostly from soybean oil. Other vegetable oils and animal fats constitute a small fraction of biodiesel feedstock. As in the case of corn, soybean is mostly grown in the Midwest (Figure 2-6) and has established markets and infrastructure for storage and delivery.', 'Biodiesel can be blended and used in many different concentrations. The most common are B5 (up to 5% biodiesel) and B20 (6% to 20% biodiesel). B100 (pure biodiesel) is typically used as a blendstock to produce lower blends and is rarely used as a transportation fuel.']"
Why do people hate GMO food?,"There are several reasons why people may dislike or hate GMO food. One is that people may view genetic modification as a contamination, especially when the introduced DNA comes from a species that is deemed disgusting[1]. Another reason is that people who strongly oppose GMOs may have a shakier understanding of food science than those with more moderate views. Additionally, people may have been over-sensitized to food risks due to previous and ongoing food scandals in Europe and may erroneously amalgamate BSE with GMOs[4]. Finally, research suggests that many Americans think that GMOs are worse for people's health than foods with no genetically modified ingredients[5].","['GMOs probably trigger disgust because people view genetic modification as a contamination. The effect is enforced when the introduced DNA comes from a species that is generally deemed disgusting, such as rats or cockroaches. However, DNA is DNA, whatever its source. The impact of disgust explains why people feel more averse towards GM food than other GM applications, such as GM medicine. Once disgust is elicited, the argument that GMOs cause cancer or sterility, or that they will contaminate the environment, becomes very convincing and is often used. Disgust also affects moral judgments, leading people to condemn everyone who is involved with the development and commercialization of GM products. Because people have no conscious access to the emotional source of their judgments, they consequently look for arguments to rationalize them.', 'People Strongly Against GMOs Had Shakier Understanding Of Food Science, Study Finds : The Salt GMO opponents say they want more rigorous testing by the FDA. But the study reinforces the idea that people may be reticent to learn facts they find morally upsetting, says one of the researchers.', 'People who most intensely oppose genetically modified food think they know a lot about food science, but they actually know the least, according to a peer-reviewed paper published in January in the journal Nature Human Behaviour.', 'According to this myth, virulent reactions against GMOs are due to an unfortunate series of previous and ongoing food scandals in Europe. People have been ‘over-sensitised’ and now react in a disproportionate and irrational way to any new story about food risks, however small. An extreme version of this myth argues that people erroneously amalgamate BSE with GMOs: they do not understand the science well enough to understand that there is no link between the two, since prions contain no DNA.', 'Americans have mixed views about genetically modified foods (GMOs) and their implications for society. About half of U.S. adults (51%) think GMOs are worse for people’s health than foods with no genetically modified ingredients, while 41% say GM foods have a neutral effect on health. Just 7% say they are better for health than other foods.']"
Breeding spiders for their silk,"Spider silk has many fascinating mechanical and biological characteristics which make it of great interest in many research fields[1]. To breed spiders for their silk, researchers have put the spiders’ dragline silk gene into goats[2][5], inserted a gene for a glowing protein into silkworms to identify those that had incorporated the spider genes[3], and conducted genetic studies to learn how spiders make their silk[2][5]. Additionally, when spiders are kept in appropriate conditions and with a reliable supply of food, they can mate all year long and cannibalism rate is significantly reduced[1].","['Due to fascinating mechanical and biological characteristics spider silk is of great interest in many research fields. Among the orb-weavers Nephila edulis is one of the species used as source for natural spider silk in laboratories. Under appropriate conditions, animals can be kept and bred easily. This manuscript gives information about the spiders’ natural habitat, behavior, and breeding and compares them with the established methods and conditions within a research laboratory. Keeping conditions and methods of rearing are described in detail. Within a keeping facility with reliable supply of food, cannibalism rate is significantly reduced and spiders mate all year long. Cohabitants of the genus Steatoda are routinely found in laboratory keeping. While these small spiders do not pose a threat to Nephila edulis, cellar spiders (family Pholcidae) have to be extracted as they have been observed hunting for Nephila spiders.', 'To solve this problem, Randy Lewis, a professor of molecular biology at the University of Wyoming, and other researchers decided to put the spiders’ dragline silk gene into goats in such a way that the goats would only make the protein in their milk. Like any other genetic factor, only a certain percentage of the goats end up with the gene. For instance, of seven goat kids born in February 2010, three have tested positive for having the silk protein gene. When these transgenic goats have kids and start lactating, the researchers will collect the milk and purify the spider silk protein into “much, much higher quantities,” Lewis said.', 'To identify the silkworms that had incorporated the spider genes, Teulé and Miao added another passenger to their PiggyBac vehicle – a gene for a glowing protein. The insects that had been successfully engineered all had glowing red eyes.', 'Evolutionary biologist Trine Bilde at Aarhus University in Denmark spearheaded the first genome project as part of her research into the boom and bust lives of the African social velvet spider, Stegodyphus mimosarum. This species lives in nests, with up to 1000 individuals, mostly females, spinning dense, meter-sized webs capable of snaring 15-centimeter-long grasshoppers. The spiders are homebodies and therefore tend to breed only within their colony. That habit, plus evidence that colonies sometimes die out very quickly, suggested that they might be highly inbred, lacking the genetic variation that shields other organisms against such die-offs. Yet the species also thrives in a wide range of temperatures and humidity.', 'Hayashi and her colleagues are now building on the genetic studies to learn how spiders make their silk. The typical orb weaving spider has many silk glands divided into seven types; each type of gland produces a specific mixture of proteins, which forms a distinctive type of silk when it is extruded through one of the spider\'s spinnerets. Hayashi and her colleagues have recently identified which silk genes are active in each of the golden orb-weaver\'s seven types of glands. They have also looked for the activity of similar genes in the silk glands and other tissues of cobweb-weaving spiders, a subset of orb weavers that build 3D webs instead of flat ones. They discovered 209 potential silk and glue components, the team reported on 21 August in Scientific Reports. ""It\'s mind boggling,"" Hayashi says.']"
"If global warming causes ice to melt, why isn't there a corresponding evaporation effect to curb a rise in ocean levels?","The melting of sea ice does not cause a corresponding evaporation effect to curb a rise in ocean levels because sea ice melting does not increase the mass of the ocean[1][4], but instead increases the volume[1][4][5], and therefore causes the water level to rise. Additionally, melting sea ice is causing changes in ocean circulation as the temperature and density of water changes, and is also speeding up warming in the Arctic due to less ice reflecting sunlight out to space, and more being absorbed by the water and land[3].","['But what is the actual relevance of this effect? Does is contribute significantly to sea level rise? Before answering this questions we should deal with an objection raised by Jenkins and Holland (2007). They are arguing that a huge amount of energy is required to melt the ice. They find that the energy comes from the ocean, as the albedo (reflectivity) of ice is very high, it doesn’t absorb much solar energy. Hence the ocean will cool a bit, causing the density of the briny water to increase (It should be noted that fresh water exhibits the peculiar behavior that its density increases as the temperature falls almost all the way to freezing; but just before freezing, the density is reduced. Briny water does not exhibit that reversal). The cooling therefore offsets the density decrease at least partially in the words of Jenkins and Holland.', 'When warming temperatures gradually melt sea ice over time, fewer bright surfaces are available to reflect sunlight back into the atmosphere. More solar energy is absorbed at the surface and ocean temperatures rise. This begins a cycle of warming and melting. Warmer water temperatures delay ice growth in the fall and winter, and the ice melts faster the following spring, exposing dark ocean waters for a longer period the following summer.', 'Each year, the amount of sea ice that covers the Arctic Ocean grows in the winter and then melts at its edges in the summer. But lately, warmer temperatures have caused more ice to melt in the summer and less ice to grow in winter. The summer thickness of sea ice is about half of what it was in 1950. Melting sea ice could cause changes in ocean circulation as the temperature and density of water changes. It is also speeding up warming in the Arctic – with less ice, less sunlight is reflected out to space and more is absorbed by the water and land. Typically, almost all of the sunlight that hits sea ice is reflected back out to space, but as the ice melts, the ocean underneath is exposed, which absorbs more sunlight, causing more climate warming.', 'Icebergs and frozen seawater also melt in warm temperatures but are not significant contributors to sea level rise. This is because they are already in the water. The volume of water they displace as ice is about the same as the volume of water they add to the ocean when they melt. As a result, sea level does not rise when sea ice melts. While density differences between salt water and freshwater result in a difference between the volume of salty sea water being displaced by sea ice and the freshwater that would result from the melting of that sea ice, it is minimal and beyond the scope of this lesson.', 'The melting of sea ice therefore doesn’t increase the mass but it increases the volume and therefore causes the water level to rise. After Noerdlinger’s and Brower’s calculations the volume of the meltwater is about 2.6% larger than the displaced sea water.']"
"If it takes 4.9 gallons of water to grow one walnut, what happens to all that water?!?!","The water used to grow the walnuts is mostly lost through evaporation and put back into the water cycle[4].

"When it comes to Food source, why do we not farm pigeons, sparrows, and other common birds for their eggs?","Farming pigeons, sparrows, and other common birds for their eggs is not a common practice because these birds have a wide variety of food sources and are not reliant on a single food source. Pigeons feed primarily on seeds and grain, but they will also eat human food scraps, bird feed, livestock feed, and other food sources like vegetables, short grass, young shoots, seedlings, and cultivated grain. They are also generalists in their feeding habits, so they can consume garbage, insects, bread, and other handouts from people[4]. In addition, it is believed that they do not need grit or oyster shell to aid in the breakdown of food and can even experience gastrointestinal issues if they overeat grit[5].","['Pigeons feed primarily on seeds and grain, but in urban areas they also eat human food scraps like bread crumbs, etc. Bird feeders provide a primary food source for pigeons in urban and suburban areas. Pigeons are especially fond of cracked corn and sorghum or milo seeds in general bird seed mixes. In agricultural areas pigeons eat or contaminate large amounts of livestock feed. Pigeons are not picky about their food: they are often seen picking undigested seeds from the feces of livestock.', 'It is common for large quantities of grain to be distributed by those selling shooting services in an effort to attract more birds for ‘guns’. Wood pigeons, like most birds, breed according to the volume of food available to them and therefore this practice is almost certainly why the species is increasing in numbers at such an alarming rate. Over-shooting for profit is undoubtedly the main contributory factor in relation to the bird moving into urban habitats where it is starting to cause problems in residential gardens, according to PiCAS International.', ""Wood pigeons will exploit multiple food sources, including vegetables, short grass (particularly manicured lawns), young shoots, seedlings and cultivated grain. The bird's ability to exploit multiple food sources and to adapt to different habitats is almost certainly why it is so successful. The wood pigeon is a flock bird and can be seen in huge flocks numbering many thousands of birds in rural areas, particularly in mid winter when exploiting agricultural crops."", 'Pigeons, familiar to most people, are an exotic (nonnative) species. They are generalists in their feeding habits; although they prefer grain and seed, they consume garbage, insects, bread, and other handouts from people. Around barns pigeons can subsist on spilled or improperly stored grain. They nest on building ledges, rafters, and beams. Nests are shallow, flimsy platforms made of sticks, twigs, and grasses. Pigeons can breed year-round, although peak production occurs in spring and fall.', 'Controversy exists over the need for gravel or grit. It was once believed that grit was necessary for the mechanical breakdown of food in the gizzard to aid in digestion. Unlike parrots that remove the outside seed hull before they eat the seed kernel, pigeons and doves ingest seeds whole and seem to do fine without grit. To aid in the breakdown of food, pigeons and doves may be offered a small amount of crushed eggshell or digestible oyster shell grit which can also serve as a source of calcium. Many birds will, in fact, have gastrointestinal problems if they overeat grit, so only digestible oyster shell should be offered.']"
"Why do my teeth, the most durable part of me, require substantially more care both daily (brushing) and yearly (clinic cleanings) than any other similarly-sized body part, many of which are more vital? How is dentistry not a scam?","Good oral health is essential to keeping overall health in check, as poor oral hygiene can lead to or worsen other health conditions. Regular brushing and cleaning between teeth is important to help reduce the risk of caries and periodontal disease[2], and flossing or using interdental cleaning devices can help prevent periodontitis[3]. Brushing twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste is optimal for reducing the risk of caries, gingival recession, or periodontitis[4]. Additionally, preventive dental care, which includes regular checkups and follow-up treatment as well as good oral health habits, is important for people living with chronic conditions such as diabetes and osteoporosis, as these conditions can make them more vulnerable to developing health complications[5]. Therefore, dentistry is not a scam, as it is essential for overall health and well-being.","['Oral health worsens in the face of chronic illnesses such as diabetes and osteoporosis.

An individual who visits the dentist twice a year for an oral exam and dental prophylaxis will spend approximately two hours per year in the dental chair. The time for that same person to brush and clean between his or her teeth each day might be estimated to be around 30 hours per year. Considering the amount of time that should be devoted to daily oral hygiene, it is important to understand the scientific evidence that supports home oral care recommendations for patients.', 'Recent analysis using NHANES data found that adults who more frequently reported using floss or other devices to clean between their teeth were found less likely to have periodontitis.44 Because of the barriers to interdental cleaning, it may not be effective to tell patients that they must floss and expect it to become a regular part of their oral home care routine. Instead, dentists can support effective home oral care by gauging their patient’s level of understanding, learning about their motivation, and then serving as a “coach” by communicating and promoting daily cleaning between their teeth.45 Discussing the various interdental cleaning devices can help educate patients on available options and provide them with some of the skills necessary to be effective stewards of their own oral health.', 'Review of the scientific literature, along with guidance from governmental organizations and professional associations found sufficient evidence to support the contention that twice-daily brushing, when compared with lower frequencies, was optimal for reducing risk of caries, 2-4 gingival recession or periodontitis.5-7 It is important to recognize that in these studies, it was the frequency of tooth-brushing with a fluoride toothpaste that was evaluated rather than tooth-brushing alone.', 'When it comes to preventive dental care, the approach is two-fold. First, it involves going to the dentist for regular checkups and performing any recommended follow-up treatment. Second, good oral health habits are crucial for keeping the body in good working order.

How does/could cooling air help a jet engine?,"Air cooling can help a jet engine in several ways. Air bled off from the high pressure compressor is typically used to cool the high pressure turbine blades, which are usually in the neighborhood of 2500F[1]. Air can also be used to cool the flame in the combustion chamber, which helps to prevent damage to the engine[4][5]. Additionally, air cooling can be used to increase the density of the compressor air, resulting in more power[5]. Finally, some studies have suggested that circulating refrigerant could be used to move heat from the wing and fuselage to the fuel tank containing liquid hydrogen in order to replace titanium skins with cheaper aluminum[2].","['The thing most in need of cooling inside a jet engine is usually the high pressure turbine blades.

The conclusion was that this would help only at airspeeds much greater than Mach 3."", ""Jet engines are cooled and temperature managed by the mass air flow itself which is used to surround and limit the boundaries of the flame, keeping it away from the burner can walls, and dilute the heat of the flame as it passes to the turbine (only a minority of the mass airflow's oxygen is actually burned - which is why afterburners work; there's lots of leftover oxygen to work with)."", 'Any time we ignite fuel inside a piston engine’s cylinders, we generate heat, which has to go somewhere—be dissipated—before increasing to the point damage is done. Air cooling an aircraft engine has the advantage of relatively light weight—the radiator, associated plumbing and relatively heavy liquid aren’t needed—and an endless supply of coolant. For most applications, we’re of the opinion putting a liquid-cooled engine on a personal airplane is akin to cooling a submarine with air. But no matter how simple air cooling a piston engine can be, pilots have found ways to screw it up.', 'If you mean liquid cooling like the piston engine in your car then no, as stated above boundary layer air cooling is used to keep vanes cool, shape the flame in the combustion chamber to stop it touching anything. There is a large amount of air available and means to control it. The Pegasus engine in the Harrier uses water methanol as a thrust augmentation system, cooling the compressor air, making it more dense, making more power.']"
Why do horses have to be put down when they injure their legs?,"Horses have to be put down when they injure their legs because the majority of times, the horse has shattered their leg bone, making surgery impossible[1][2]. Even if surgery can be done, there are still significant risks such as severe pain, infection, re-injury during the healing period due to the horse's high flight risk, and developing crippling conditions like laminitis and abscesses during recovery[1].

The most common reason is that the majority of times, the horse has shattered their leg bone, making surgery impossible. If surgery can be done, there are still significant risks.

"Why is it possible for certain animals, particularly typical pets, to die from extreme stress?","Animals, particularly typical pets, can die from extreme stress due to a variety of factors. Bringing a new pet into the home too soon can cause increased stress and anxiety in existing pets[1], and pets may also experience stress brought on by grief or loss[2].

Could someone compare current American politics to the House of Cards tv show?,"Yes, it is possible to compare current American politics to the House of Cards tv show.

what are horses used for this day in age where pretty much all farming is done with vehicles and such.,"Horses are still used in many ways today, although they are mostly replaced with cars and tractors in industrialized countries. Horses can still be used for manual labor and transportation in rural or underdeveloped areas[1], as well as clearing fields and hard-to-reach areas for farming[2]. They are also used to help with other daily tasks on the farm[3], herding animals and carrying people or goods. Horses are also used for recreation, sport, entertainment, and competition.","['Though people living in rural or underdeveloped areas still use horses for manual labor and transportation, industrialized countries have mostly replaced horses with cars and tractors.

Even commercial logging operations may still use horses to clear trees from hard-to-reach areas.', 'Today, horses may not be used to cultivate the fields, but they are still useful on the farm. They help to herd large groups of animals as well as can help with other daily tasks on the farm.', 'Horses were used in war, in hunting and as a means of transport.

How can a molecule like chlorophyll get energy from light? What physical/chemical changes are happening to the molecule?,"Chlorophyll molecules can get energy from light when a photon from the sun hits them. This excites the chlorophyll molecule and starts a process that splits a molecule of water. The energy from the photon is transferred from chlorophyll to chlorophyll, until it is eventually delivered to the reaction center[2][3]. At the reaction center in photosystem I, the electrons jump up to a high-energy state when a photon arrives at P700[3][4]. The chlorophyll then absorbs energy from light in the blue/violet and red range of the light spectrum[1][3][5]. This energy is stored in a high-energy molecule like sugar, which is the principal product of photosynthesis.[3][5]","['When light hits a plant’s leaves, it shines on chloroplasts and into their thylakoid membranes. Those membranes are filled with chlorophyll, a green pigment. This pigment absorbs light energy. Light travels as electromagnetic waves. The wavelength — distance between waves — determines energy level. Some of those wavelengths are visible to us as the colors we see. If a molecule, such as chlorophyll, has the right shape, it can absorb the energy from some wavelengths of light.', 'When a photon of light from the sun bounces into a leaf, its energy excites a chlorophyll molecule. That photon starts a process that splits a molecule of water. The oxygen atom that splits off from the water instantly bonds with another, creating a molecule of oxygen, or O2. The chemical reaction also produces a molecule called ATP and another molecule called NADPH. Both of these allow a cell to store energy. The ATP and NADPH also will take part in the synthesis part of photosynthesis.', 'Both photosystems have the same basic structure; a number of antenna proteins to which the chlorophyll molecules are bound surround the reaction center where the photochemistry takes place. Each photosystem is serviced by the light-harvesting complex, which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center; it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a mixture of 300–400 chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids. The absorption of a single photon or distinct quantity or “packet” of light by any of the chlorophylls pushes that molecule into an excited state. In short, the light energy has now been captured by biological molecules but is not stored in any useful form yet. The energy is transferred from chlorophyll to chlorophyll until eventually (after about a millionth of a second), it is delivered to the reaction center. Up to this point, only energy has been transferred between molecules, not electrons.', 'Photosystem I also consists of light-harvesting complexes with lots of pigment molecules for capturing light energy. Light energy harvested from photons and intermediate-energy electrons from photosystem II flow to a special chlorophyll a molecule structure called P700 in photosystem I. Electrons jump up to a high-energy state when a photon arrives at P700, either directly from sunlight, or through a collision with an already excited pigment.', 'The principal product of photosynthesis (sugar) is a high-energy molecule, but the reactants (carbon dioxide and water), are low-energy molecules, so the process of photosynthesis needs an energy source to drive it. Molecules called pigments absorb energy from light. The main pigment in photosynthesis is called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll exists in several different forms in different organisms. Chlorophyll a is the main photosynthetic pigment found in land plants and algae. It absorbs light in the blue/violet range of the light spectrum (wavelengths of 400-450nm) as you can see in Figure 2. It also absorbs light in the red range of the spectrum (wavelengths of 650-700nm) to a lesser degree. Green light is almost completely reflected by chlorophyll, giving plants their greenish hue.']"
Do animals actually smile or are we just projecting a happy emotion onto them?,"It is still unclear if animals actually smile or if we are just projecting a happy emotion onto them. Studies have shown that dogs appear to be smiling in positive situations, like while playing or on walks, but scientists are still unsure whether these ""smiles"" indicate happiness or are simply another means of communication[1]. It is not certain if animals are even capable of crying and smiling in the same way humans do[1][2]. To date, researchers haven’t found concrete evidence that dogs smile to communicate happiness[3], but it does look like dogs smile when they are comfortable, content and in a low emotional arousal state[4]. Pet owners may be able to distinguish between a genuine and a fake smile on their companion's face, but further research is needed to determine if animals can actually feel and express emotions in the same way humans do.[1]","['A study published in Scientific Reports found that dogs appear to be smiling in positive situations, like while playing or on walks. But scientists are still unsure whether these “smiles” indicate happiness or are simply another means of communication. “There is no data that explains a dog’s smile,” University of Portsmouth researcher Juliane Kaminski said. The debate on animal emotions has been ongoing for over a century. Charles Darwin declared in his 1872 publication The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals that humans and animals express emotions the same way. Like how humans cry when they’re sad or laugh when they’re happy.', 'Are animals even capable of crying and smiling in the human sense? If they are, what makes them emotional? If not, how do they feel comfortable expressing emotions?', 'It sure looks like our dogs are happy when they make that adorable grin, especially when it’s accompanied by bright eyes, a wiggly body and a wagging tail. But do dogs smile to convey happiness to humans and other dogs? To date, researchers haven’t found concrete evidence that dogs smile to communicate happiness.', 'For example, when people interpret a smile on a dog’s face, they typically see a couple of different expressions. “One is a soft, relaxed, open-mouth expression that is more likely to be shown when a dog is comfortable, content and otherwise in a low emotional arousal state,” says Christopher Pachel, DVM, a veterinarian and certified animal behavior consultant at the Animal Behavior Clinic in Portland, Oregon.', ""A pet's emotion can elicit compassion or exhilaration in us. Attentive pet owners actually know their companion gives them a genuine smile, just like human beings know when they encounter a fake or natural smile.""]"
Hydrogenation.,"Hydrogenation is a chemical reaction between molecular hydrogen (H2) and another compound or element, usually in the presence of a catalyst such as nickel, palladium or platinum[1][2][3].

Why do horses have to be put down if they get a broken leg?,"Horses have to be put down if they get a broken leg because the majority of times the horse has shattered their leg bone, making surgery impossible[1]. Even if surgery could be done, there are still significant risks, such as the high flight risk, the chance of developing crippling conditions during recovery, and the high cost of treatment[1]. Also, it would be hard to immobilize the horse for days or weeks, and the horse may develop pressure ulcers if it lies down for too long[3]. Furthermore, there are a number of painful conditions that can develop during the rehabilitation process, and euthanizing the animal may be considered more humane than letting it live and suffer[4]. However, if the break is minor or if the horse is still young, the chances for recovery may be higher.","['There are many reasons why horses have to be put down as a result of a broken leg. The most common reason is that the majority of times, the horse has shattered their leg bone, making surgery impossible. If surgery can be done, there are still significant risks. Horses spend the majority of their time standing (even when they sleep) and they have a very high flight risk, both of which increase the risk of re-injury during the healing period. Also, 60 to 65 percent of their weight is on their front legs, increasing the chance of developing crippling conditions like laminitis and abscesses during recovery. Other factors include severe pain, infection and the high cost of treatment.', 'A horse with a broken leg (especially if the break is of the ‘wrong’ kind) is usually ‘put down’ or euthanized. In simple words, the horse is killed.', 'Although a broken leg must get some rest to allow the bones to heal properly, horse owners know that they will have a hard time immobilizing their horse for days or weeks. Also, a horse with such a heavy body will develop pressure ulcers if it lies down for too long, so that is another problem to deal with.', 'Even if a horse owner decides to give the broken leg a chance to heal, there are a number of things that can go wrong during the recovery process. Several painful conditions can develop during the rehabilitation process. Some people consider euthanizing the animal more humane than letting it live and suffer.', 'When breaks are minor, such as small fractures,or when they are still young, the chances for recovery are higher. A foal with a broken leg may have a much better chance at recovery because they are still young and growing, and their bodies are lighter.']"
"Why do people have passionate empathy for dogs/cats, but little to none for cows/chickens?","People have a passionate empathy for dogs and cats because they are considered ""fur babies"" or family members akin to human children[4]. Additionally, research has shown that humans tend to have more compassion for animals who are suffering than for adult humans in similar circumstances, treating the hurt dogs akin to helpless infants who need protection[4]. On the other hand, people may have less empathy for cows and chickens due to the “collapse of compassion”, which is the psychological principle which tells us that the more tragedy we see, the less we care[2]. Furthermore, chickens are capable of empathy, but the same level of empathy is not extended to them.","['If we analyze our feelings carefully, we find that most of our adoration of animals centers on dogs and cats. Additionally, we sometimes might feel empathy for certain large, charismatic wild animals such as elephants, dolphins, or lions. When we read about a lion or an elephant who is hunted and killed in the wild, our response is often one of anger – almost as much anger as hearing stories of abuse and neglect of dogs and cats.', 'Our reverence for dogs and cats over other species could also be explained by something called ""the collapse of compassion."" This is the psychological principle which tells us that the more tragedy we see, the less we care. It\'s the answer to why you may not feel any compassion for the millions of people living in extreme poverty, while the story of one child living on the street with no medical care is more likely to move you to want to help.', 'Many humans feel love and empathy towards animals, but do the animals we care about so deeply feel the same about us? How about each other? Scientific research backs the idea of emotions in animals. In fact, researchers have observed empathy in them, as well as grief, fear and other complex emotions often associated primarily with humans.', 'Regardless of the reasons for domestication, the emotional connection between pets and their owners is worthy of cross-cultural attention. For example, it has been discovered that dogs are able to read emotional cues from the faces of their owners and to respond accordingly. Other recent studies have shown that people tend to have more compassion for animals who are suffering than for adult humans in similar circumstances, treating the hurt dogs akin to helpless infants who need protection. Based on global data, researchers in this telling social experiment concluded that, by and large, subjects “did not view their dogs as animals, but rather as ‘fur babies’ or family members alongside human children”.', 'Chickens are the epitome of empaths.

Do animals intentionally commit suicide like humans?,"While there have been some observed cases of animals seemingly taking their own lives in situations when one might expect a human to take his or her own life[1], and some insect species commit suicide in order to save their family members from predators or other threats[2], there is still not enough data and evidence to indicate a clear conclusion that animals are capable of intentionally committing suicide like humans[5].","['I’m often asked if nonhuman animals commit suicide. My answer is that there are some interesting observations of animals seemingly taking their own lives in situations when one might expect a human to take his or her own life. For example, it’s been suggested that whales intentionally beach themselves to end their lives, highly stressed elephants step on their trunks or jump over a cliff to end prolonged pain, and cats stressed out by earthquakes kill themselves.', 'Several insect species commit suicide in order to save their family members from predators or other threats. The answer is more controversial when it comes to mammals and other animals, however. While it’s impossible to know the intentions of animals who have seemingly taken their own lives, cases of apparent suicide do exist—animals grieving for a human or non-human companion sometimes refuse to eat to the point of starvation, for example.', 'Ultimately, while we don’t and probably never will truly know whether animals are capable of committing suicide, we can notice their destructive behaviors and help them. Even if it’s not scientifically confirmed that animals possess the will and intention to put an end to their lives, they may still require our support, help, compassion, and affection.', 'If humans exhibit these behaviors, they’ll definitely be considered suicidal. It’s a different story with animals, however. Studies show that even the most convincing stories of alleged animal suicide didn’t have enough evidence to become an animal model of suicide. Moreover, scientists believe that will and intention — the most relevant aspects of suicide — will hardly ever have animal models.', 'However, there’s still not enough data and evidence to indicate a clear conclusion because committing suicide implies understanding numerous other concepts. For instance, if an animal is capable of committing suicide, it means it’s conscious of its mortality, of the possibility that it can die, of choosing to die, and of having or not having a future. But, above all, this means the animal has will and intention. Some studies focused on these aspects individually, and many found evidence showing that some animal responses were relevant to human emotional behaviors. Nevertheless, there’s still no conclusive evidence showing they are simultaneously aware of all of them.']"
Why does the American FDA allow so many chemicals in food that are proven to be harmful and are banned in other countries?,"The American FDA allows many chemicals in food that are proven to be harmful and are banned in other countries due to a loophole called GRAS (generally recognized as safe)[4][5]. This loophole allows manufacturers to decide for themselves, in secret, that a confidential chemical is safe based on unpublished studies by industry-funded experts[4]. This means that chemicals can enter the market with no independent safety review[5]. Additionally, the FDA takes a less aggressive approach to regulating additives[3], which means that many ingredients banned in other countries remain in our food supply[3].","['It is appalling to witness the examples I am about to share with you. The U.S. food corporations are unnecessarily feeding us chemicals – while leaving out almost all questionable ingredients in our friends’ products overseas. The point is the food industry has already formulated safer, better products, but they are voluntarily only selling inferior versions of these products here in America. The evidence of this runs the gamut from fast food places to boxed cake mix to cereal to candy and even oatmeal – you can’t escape it.', 'Many foods sold in the United States are banned or fiercely regulated in other countries due to harmful additives, growth promoters, genetically engineered ingredients, herbicides, or other dangerous practices. Does this concern you? It should!', 'The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) takes a less aggressive approach to regulating additives, which means that many ingredients banned in other countries remain in our food supply. This is yet another reason to avoid processed—especially ultra-processed—foods.', 'Year after year we hear about new and unintended ways chemicals in food can impact human health, from cancer and infertility to behavior disorders in kids. Yet the food industry, using the GRAS loophole, is allowed to keep information about the chemicals it employs under wraps. The FDA rule lets manufacturers decide for themselves, in secret, that a confidential chemical is safe based on unpublished studies by industry-funded experts. How can a substance that is not generally known to the government or the public be generally recognized as anything, let alone safe?', 'Most Americans would be shocked to learn that the FDA allows novel—even untested—chemicals to enter the market with no independent safety review. But the practice is all too common, thanks to a loophole that has swallowed food safety law whole. More than fifty years ago, Congress created an exemption from safety testing for food additives that were “generally recognized as safe,” or GRAS. The loophole was written in an era when food additives were typically ingredients like vinegar, salt and vegetable oil. It seemed reasonable to allow industry to bypass rigorous review for these common additives. The FDA proposed an even more generous GRAS exemption in 1997, and this FDA proposal was just finalized.']"
"How does a lake, that dries out completely during drought, regain fish population after rain-season?","After a period of drought, fish populations in lakes that dry out completely can be restored after the rain-season by the combination of crowding, encouraging aquatic plant growth and harvesting fish. The flash flows from the late-season rains can prompt some fish to respond to the wet season and head upstream, where they get stuck[3]. The lake can fill completely only an average of twice in a century, but partial, minor fillings happen much more often[5]. The lake is fed by a vast internal continental drainage basin and rivers in the basin can feed the lake only when they are in flood after heavy rains[5].","['It’s extremely rare to see a summer drought at Poyang, but it happened this year and was very different to the ordinary autumn and winter dry season. The drought was catastrophic for the lake’s submerged aquatic plants, while wetland plants started their period of rapid growth earlier than usual. During a dry season, Poyang Lake dries up into a hundred or so smaller and shallower lakes, which is where the wintering migratory birds find their food. The Siberian crane, tundra swan and swan goose feed mainly from the stem tubers of the submerged aquatic plants in those shallow lakes. But the drought meant even those shallow lakes dried up and the plants died. There were no stem tubers for the birds to eat.', 'During a drought, pond water levels continue to drop, exposing the shoreline and reducing pond volume. The combination of these events causes fish crowding and encourages aquatic plant growth. Fish harvest should be increased as the drought begins. If you and your family are not able to make more frequent and longer fishing visits to the pond, invite others to catch fish. Some fish species, particularly catfish, can be caught using traps or trot lines. Your goal should be to remove as many large catfish as possible, catch at least 50 pounds of bream per acre, and catch an additional 5 pounds of largemouth bass per acre (up to 35 pounds per acre).', 'The problem, according to Ewing, is not only that streams have too little water because of the drought but that late-season rains led to flash flows that prompted some fish to respond as they would have earlier in the wet season and head upstream, where they got stuck.', 'California drought: Fish dying in dried-up Clear Lake streambeds. Two bass fishermen cast on Clear Lake with Mount Konocti looming in the background, as swallows dip and dive and a grebe bobs on the surface.', 'Water reaching the lake evaporates very rapidly, and the surface of the lake bed has a thin crust of salt deposited by water that has evaporated. Lake Eyre’s typical state is dry. It fills completely only an average of twice in a century, but partial, minor fillings happen much more often. After being completely filled (as in 1950, 1974, and 1984), the lake takes about two years to dry up again. Lake Eyre is in a region of very low and intermittent rainfall amounting to less than 5 inches (125 mm) annually. The lake is fed by a vast internal continental drainage basin, but evaporation rates in the region are so high that most of the rivers in the basin dry up before reaching the lake. Thus, the waters of the Diamantina and other rivers can feed the lake only when they are in flood after heavy rains.']"
How is a chicken egg one cell?,"A chicken egg is one cell in the sense that it is a single cell before it is fertilized.

How can it be illegal to take pictures or videos of animal abuse inside of a slaughterhouse?,"It can be illegal to take pictures or videos of animal abuse inside of a slaughterhouse if laws are in place that prohibit taking photographs or videos at animal facilities without the owner's consent[2].

Further, such practices would dampen consumer demand for broadband services, disrupting the virtuous cycle, and harming end user and edge provider use of the Internet under the legal standard we set forth today. (We also note that the no-unreasonable interference/disadvantage standard does not unconstitutionally burden any of the First Amendment rights held by broadband providers because broadband providers are conduits, not speakers, with respect to broadband Internet access services.)"", '190. We adopt our tentative conclusion in the 2014 Open Internet NPRM that broadband Internet access service does not include virtual private network (VPN) services, content delivery networks (CDNs), hosting or data storage services, or Internet backbone services (to the extent those services are separate from broadband Internet access service). The Commission has historically distinguished these services from “mass market” services and, as explained in the 2014 Open Internet NPRM, they “do not provide the capability to receive data from all or substantially all Internet endpoints.” We do not disturb that finding here. Likewise, when a user employs, for example, a wireless router or a Wi-Fi hotspot to create a personal Wi-Fi network that is not intentionally offered for the benefit of others, he or she is not providing a broadband Internet access service under our definition.']"
Why is classical music considered the best for studying?,"Classical music is considered the best for studying due to its ability to increase focus and cognitive function[2]. It also triggers brain waves that are linked to our memories[3] and reduces the deployment of the stress hormone[5], which can help to improve mood and focus. Additionally, classical music has certain sequences that are repeated throughout the composition, which occur at 20-30 second intervals and the average brain wave pattern is also exactly 30 seconds, making it very powerful[1]. It can also help to break the monotony of studying, which can help to increase creativity and confidence[3].","['The good news is that classical music for studying has shown to have a powerful impact on the overall health of a special needs person. It teaches them patience and soothes their emotions, allowing them to be more focused, less impulsive, and bring them back to feeling good about themselves. Those children that are exposed to classical music are shown to feel more comfortable about how they feel. We know this to be factual, because classical music has certain sequences that are repeated throughout the composition. These often occur at 20-30 second intervals and the average brain wave pattern is exactly 30 seconds, making a musical piece extremely powerful.', 'Classical music also helps areas of the brain responsible for focus and memory to become more active. When you stop or pause the music, your brain is wired for an increase in concentration, improving your productivity. If you’re a student, using classical music for studying is a great way to increase your focus or concentration. You’re more likely to grasp concepts better and remember vital information when listening to classical music. While other genres of music, such as hip hop, may be distracting during study, classical music increases your focus and cognitive function.', 'Bach and Beethoven may not be your first choice, but you are missing out if you don’t give it a listen at your next study session. When you play classical music for studying, it triggers brain waves that are linked to our memories. It can also help you to relax so you can focus more on those books. When you listen to classical music tuned down to 432Hz, your senses are also more awake and alert. Anything higher has proven to cause inner ear disturbances and feelings of uneasiness in the listener.', 'The proof that classical music for studying has a direct impact on our brains, hearts and body is out there. Give classical music a try and then give us a tweet at www.twitter.com/MusicArtsFan . You can even share your own study tips and techniques with us over at www.Facebook.com/MusicArtsFan', 'Classical music reduces the deployment of the stress hormone. Classical music compositions are loaded with upbeat melodies, which in turn, improve your mood. When you share music with others, the brain releases Oxytocin, ‘The Trust Molecule’ which will cause you to feel connected and bonded to the other person or people in the room. Imagine if you shared Mozart at your next study group. Everyone would be in happier mood, and working together with renewed vigor and much more efficiently! The repetition of studying puts most in a foul mood. Monotony is a confidence and mood suppressant, and classical music breaks the boring cycle. If you have a group working together on a project, put on classical music for studying to unleash everyone’s creativity and confidence.']"
Is there a reason why lobsters are thrown into boiling water while alive? Wouldn't it be more humane to quickly kill them before boiling or is there a reason why this is not done?,"Boiling lobsters alive is a way to reduce the risk of food poisoning from bacteria that live in their flesh and that quickly multiply on their carcasses, and also to make them tastier and better presented on the plate[2].

Anyone who has ever boiled a lobster alive can attest that, when dropped into scalding water, lobsters whip their bodies wildly and scrape the sides of the pot in a desperate attempt to escape.

The idea of plunging the creature into a boiling pot of water to meet a painful death can be a bit off-putting – but it might not be the whole story. Here’s how to kill a lobster without feeling bad about it.', ""So boiling lobsters alive save us from a world of pain, but what about the lobsters? For starters, lobsters don't scream when you boil them. In fact, they lack lungs and don’t even have the proper biological equipment to form a scream. What you hear is air and steam escaping from the shells of their simmering suppers. In any case - we don't do this to chickens or pigs because it’s pretty obvious that they can feel pain. For lobsters, it’s less clear if their primitive nervous systems and brains even know what pain is. When a lobster thrashes around in the pot does that mean it’s in agony? Or is it simply a reflex response to the boiling water, but not a conscious action? No one really knows, so more research is needed.""]"
how do they spread the coloured latex in fetal pigs (for dissection) into all the veins and arteries?,The coloured latex is injected into the veins and arteries of the fetal pig through an incision made on the side of the neck[1][2][4]. This injection is done in order to fill the arteries with red latex and the veins with blue latex[1][2][3]. This helps to identify the different types of vessels in the fetal pig's circulatory system during dissection[2].,"['The fetal pig that you will dissect has been injected with a colored latex (rubber) compound. The arteries have been filled with red latex and the veins with blue. An incision was made on the side of the neck to enable the injections. The incision can be seen in the first photograph below.', 'In this lab you will identify all of the major blood vessels that make up the fetal pig circulatory system. This dissection will take 2-3 lab periods. In the first half of the time you will concentrate on the anterior (above the heart) arteries and veins, then finish with the posterior vessels (below the heart) in the second half. As you will see, there is already an incision on the side of the pig’s neck. Latex has been injected into the fetal pig blood vessels through this incision so that the arteries appear pink and the veins blue. Be aware that these colors are not always reliable. Sometimes the latex does not get into all the vessels as it should so they appear collapsed and discolored, and sometimes the muscle layer of arteries can weaken so that they appear pale blue. Thus, remember that the color of a vessel is only of limited usefulness in identifying it. You will need to use other clues (location, etc) to be completely sure.', 'In your pig thearteries have been injected with red latex and the veins have been injected with blue latex.

Why scientists didn't do artificial insemination in pandas since they have difficulties in natural reproduction?,"Despite scientists having improved the success rate of panda captive breeding through artificial insemination, it is still difficult to use this method due to the difficulty of predicting when a female is ready to conceive[1], the need to sedate the female for insemination[1][2][4][5], and the complicated nature of panda pregnancy, which includes embryonic diapause, extremely varied gestation times, random hormone fluctuations, and quiet miscarriages[4].","['Improved artificial insemination has improved the success rate of panda captive breeding. In 1980, scientists learned how to preserve male sperm by freezing it in liquid hydrogen. Later U.S. scientists provided Chinese scientists with technical knowledge of artificial insemination procedures. The success rate has improved further as scientists have learned more about when a female is ready to conceive and the number of captive pandas that can be used in artificial breeding have matured.', 'In zoos, breeders often resort to artificial insemination to speed along a birth. A male giant panda is given a drug like propofol, ketamine or another anesthetic during the collection process. (This website from the University of Wisconsin’s Department of Animal Sciences explains the procedure in great detail.) Then the female is sedated for the insemination procedure. All five cubs born in Atlanta -- including the new twins -- are products of artificial insemination, according to National Geographic.', 'Finally, veterinarians perfected the science of artificial insemination for panda bears, and the number of tiny newborns slowly increased.', '“Now protocol includes artificial insemination, sometimes with sperm from two males. Part of the challenge is that female pandas are in estrus just once a year for only 24 to 72 hours. Endocrinologists monitor hormones in the urine that can predict ovulation and may inseminate several times within a day or two to boost the chances of implantation. Then, for months, females keep the keepers guessing. “It’s hard to even know if a panda is pregnant,” says BFX’s director, Zhang Guiquan. “The fetus is so tiny that it’s easy to miss on an ultrasound.” Pandas can have delayed implantation, extremely varied gestation times, random hormone fluctuations, and quiet miscarriages.', 'Neither artificial insemination nor old-fashioned mating will guarantee a pregnancy, and zoologists must bide their time before they know for sure that a panda is expecting. This, too, is complicated. Like many other species, pandas experience embryonic diapause, in which the embryo is fertilized, but not yet implanted in the uterine wall. The offspring can’t continue to grow until it has implanted, so while the gestation period is around 50 days, some panda pregnancies can stretch out to more than 160 days because of diapause.']"
- Why do we just not globally exterminate mosquitoes? Since this insect is a major cause of disease-spread and has no solo-purpose that can't be replaced by another existing insect?,"Global extermination of mosquitoes is not a feasible option since there is currently no method that is species specific, unstoppable, and inescapable[1][3]. Moreover, the insect that would replace the mosquitoes could even conceivably spread diseases further and faster than mosquitoes today[2]. Currently, the best strategies to reduce vector mosquitoes are local extirpations, such as adding fish to ponds to eat the larvae, and insecticides[3]. It is possible that another species would take the place of the mosquitoes if they were exterminated, and the ecological niche for mosquitoes doesn’t require them to carry diseases fatal to humans[4]. However, the pathogens could evolve to be spread by the mosquitoes that are still around[1][4]. Mosquitoes are the deadliest animal in the world to humans, and eliminating them would save millions of lives and eliminate much suffering and disability[5].","['No, if we are going to eradicate mosquitoes worldwide, we need a method that is species specific, unstoppable, and inescapable. Something guaranteed, by way of design, to affect only the target organism, and to be impossible to adapt to or evolve resistance against. We need autocide, where the species is unwittingly responsible for its own death. Is such a thing even possible?', 'But for Lounibos, the fact this niche would be filled by another insect is part of the problem. He warns that mosquitoes could be replaced by an insect ""equally, or more, undesirable from a public health viewpoint"". Its replacement could even conceivably spread diseases further and faster than mosquitoes today.', 'Global extermination of vector mosquitoes, whether or not it is doable and whether or not it is a good idea, is a long way off. Until then, the best strategies are to do local extirpations. If you have a pond, add goldfish, koi fish, or guppies—not necessarily mosquitofish—to eat the larvae. Insecticides are another, less ideal option, as they will kill beneficial insects too, but in emergencies they can be used as many are nontoxic to humans. That includes the ones being used in Brazil right now to fight Zika… and, no, they are not responsible for microcephaly. That claim has also been thoroughly disproven, despite what conspiracy theorists say.', 'It’s possible, even likely, that another species would take the place of the mosquitoes we exterminated. For instance, A. aegypti could be replaced by a mosquito from the Culex pipiens species complex. Culex, which is a vector for the West Nile virus, “does very badly when Aedes is present,” Juliano notes, but it might be expected to thrive in its absence. On the other hand, the newcomer might be a relatively harmless species; the ecological niche for mosquitoes doesn’t require them to carry diseases fatal to human beings. In the long term, the pathogens could evolve to be spread by the mosquitoes that are still around, but there’s plenty of time for humans to worry about that.', ""It's strange to hear people so eager to cause an extinction for once rather than prevent it, right? This hatred is not just because mosquitoes are annoying. Mosquitoes are arguably the deadliest animal in the world to humans, and I'm including other humans. They spread, or vector, diseases like malaria, yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, West Nile Virus, and Zika virus, which together cause more deaths each year than war and homicide combined. Eliminating these diseases would save millions of lives, and eliminate much suffering and disability as well. Without the mosquitoes, these diseases would cease to exist … but why is that?""]"
What is the purpose of a single egg holder? Is that how fancy people eat hardboiled eggs? Do they own many of them or just one?,"A single egg holder is a small inverted bowl on a footed stem that is just big enough to hold upright a single soft-boiled chicken egg[2][4]. It is used to keep the egg upright as you crack it open and dip the toast points into the runny yolk[3].

But for tons of people, this is a vital part of their breakfast routine, and with good reason."", 'Also called egg holders or egg servers, the cups for eggs have always come in several sizes. Most typically, an eggcup is designed to hold upright a single boiled but uncracked chicken egg. Others, somewhat larger in diameter, are intended to hold a single goose or duck egg. In addition, there were even bigger cups with lids for serving two or three opened eggs, perhaps mixed with some other element such as butter, jelly, mash potato, bread, bacon bits or another compatible food. What makes an item recognizable as a cup for an egg is its general shape and size of a round bowl on a short, footed stem. However, cups for washing eyes have the same approximate size and shape and are thus often mistaken for eggcups. An eyecup, however, should be a bit smaller, more oval and with a slightly thicker rim.', ""The small cup holds a single soft boiled egg upright so the egg doesn't fall to its side as you crack it open and dip the toast points into the runny yolk.

At one time, especially in Victorian times, boiled eggs were the essential element of breakfast, along with toast or a biscuit, for both women and men. A boiled egg was served in its shell to keep it warm, and then cracked with a knife or spoon; taking the smaller end or top off allows the contents to be eaten with a spoon. Of course, the interruptions caused by wars and subsequent population movement into cities, far from farms and the sources of fresh eggs, have long changed eating habits in America and other countries.', ""While eating a soft boiled egg with toast points is a very common breakfast in some countries like Australia and the United Kingdom, this just isn't a typical breakfast for many Americans.

The process of turning milk into bones,"The process of turning milk into bones involves the body taking out some calcium from our bones in order to process the high amount of protein found in milk[4]. Milk and milk components can also affect bone mineralization in children as well as bone biomarkers and bone mineral density in older women[2]. Milk is not necessarily the most critical factor for bone health[3], but it can be beneficial as it contains several bioactives that can affect bone formation or resorption[2]. Additionally, the body breaks down proteins and releases acids into the bloodstream, which then pulls calcium from the bones to neutralize the pH level[4]. Milk, known as ""milk bones"" can also help to build ""wisdom bones"" and prevent osteoporosis.","['Because to process the mass amount of protein that a calve needs in milk, our body needs to take out some calcium out of our bones!', 'Milk and milk components have been shown to significantly affect growth and bone mineralization in children. Studies in older women using regular or fortified milk have reported significant changes in bone biomarkers and some changes in bone mineral density, though not reduction in fracture risk. Milk and dairy products also contain several other bioactives that can affect bone formation or resorption. Combining the inherent bioactives in milk with additional pre- or probiotics can enhance the beneficial effects of milk on bone health via improvement of the intestinal absorption of minerals especially calcium and magnesium. The observed differences in diversity of microbiota between healthy and osteoporotic women open new avenues for modulating the gut profile and thereby preventing bone loss or maintaining healthy bone density.', 'Most of us grew up believing that milk is important for children to build strong bones and for the elderly to prevent osteoporosis.

Goldschmidt claims that milk is pulling calcium from the bones because milk is causing an acidifying effect in our body. However milk is a base, and the body pulls calcium from the bones when the body is breaking down proteins. The body releases acids into the bloodstream to breakdown proteins and then pulls calcium from the bones to neutralize the pH level. According to Harvard University “Nurses’ Health Study, for example, women who ate more than 95 grams of protein a day were 20 percent more likely to have broken a wrist over a 12-year period when compared to those who ate an average amount of protein (less than 68 grams a day).” Harvard University also points out that this is still a controversial topic because studies show that high protein diets also lead to high bone density.', '[THE IMPORTANCE OF ""MILK BONES"" TO ""WISDOM BONES"" - COW MILK AND BONE HEALTH - LESSONS FROM MILK ALLERGY PATIENTS]']"

Do small animals/birds/insects see humans and giant objects in slow motion based upon perspective?

Compared to us, many of these animals are able to perceive the world through a Matrix-like ""bullet-time,” allowing them to escape larger predators.', ""Now it appears that there's a kind of dynamic range that exists in vision, as well — and it has to do with the rate at which the world can be perceived. As the new study published in Animal Behavior shows, small animals like insects and small birds can take in more information in one second than a larger animal, like us bulky humans."", 'For many years, people were in the dark about how other animals see. Thankfully, recent scientific research has revealed an amazing world of animal vision diversity. For example, a dragonfly’s brain works so fast that it sees movements in slow motion, snakes pick up infrared heat signals from warm objects, thus detecting their prey, whereas horses and zebras have eyes pointed sideways, enabling them to have peripheral vision and escape danger when necessary. In addition to this, insects use compound eyes that are made of thousands of tiny lenses that look like a honeycomb pattern. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that animals are diverse in their vision and eye function, but one species in the animal kingdom stands out the most – birds.', 'Small animals with fast metabolisms, like birds and insects, take in more information per unit of time. This means they experience time slower than larger animals with slower metabolisms, like turtles and elephants. They can actually perceive time as if it’s passing in slow motion, meaning they can observe movements and events on a finer timescale. This would definitely be an advantage in some situations, increasing their reaction times and allowing them to escape—like dodging bullets in The Matrix—from larger creatures who perceive time slower, and so might miss things smaller animals can spot rapidly.']"
"I understand why plants produce flavorful fruits, but how do plants understand what would be flavorful to animals?","Plants understand what would be flavorful to animals by using natural selection over millions of years. The plants that made their fruit taste good, before or after their seeds were ready, survived and passed on this trait to their offspring. Plants can also communicate with animals through their fruits, using traits evolved to match each animal's sensory capacities or physical abilities[3]. Additionally, crop load management and the quantity and composition of volatile compounds in the fruit can affect flavor development[4][5].","['The prevailing hypothesis has been that animals could have influenced fruit traits — like shape, location on a tree, presentation on a branch or odor and color — through natural selection. The easier it is for fruit-eaters to identify ripe fruits, the better the chance for both to survive. The animal eats, and the parent plant reproduces — by using the animals as gardeners — without lifting a root.', '$\\begingroup$ ""the plant hasn\'t made it taste good because it doesn\'t want it to be eaten"" be careful with this line of thinking. The reality of evolution is that the plants that made their fruit taste good, before or after their seeds were ready, died off. The ones that happened to have the right flavor at the right time managed to survive. $\\endgroup$', 'Over millions of years of natural selection, these plants have developed ways to communicate with animals through their fruits, new research suggests, saying something like “choose me.” With traits evolved to match each animal’s sensory capacities or physical abilities, fruits can signal dinner time in the jungle, and further their plant’s survival as a species.', 'Crop load management is another important factor affecting fruit flavor development. In a study done on apples, trees with lower crop loads were found to have fruit with increased flavor development. This was mainly due to higher levels of aroma volatiles and sugars in the apple fruit with lower crop load. Many times, trying to aim for the highest yield will play against flavor development.', 'Another key component of flavor is aroma. Fruit aroma is influenced by the quantity and composition of volatile compounds. The volatiles that are well-known to affect fruit flavor include esters (fruity aroma), alcohols (fruity or earthy aroma), aldehydes (slightly grassy and bitter aroma), lactones (peach-like aroma), and terpenoids (scented oils aroma). Studies have shown that the flavor intensity of a fruit can be correlated with the quantity and composition of volatiles present. For example, strawberries that presented higher levels of certain key volatiles were perceived as sweeter and highly preferred by consumers, as compared to other strawberry varieties lacking these volatiles.']"
"When humans have to take a dump they need to wipe, but almost all animals don't..","Other animals do not need to use toilet paper because they have adapted their front legs to be hands which can be used for self-grooming[1], and because their body shape allows them to clean themselves without the need for external aids[1]. Humans, however, have adapted their anatomy to a vertical posture which compresses the area used for releasing urine and faeces, making it more likely for humans to foul themselves[2]. Furthermore, humans have come to view their waste with disgust, which has been attributed to living together in settlements rather than roaming through the forest[2]. Toilet paper may have been developed as an evolutionary adaptation to this issue, or it may have been a result of humans losing an anatomical feature that they once had. Finally, people may need to use toilet paper to remove germs from their hands that can make them sick, as feces (poop) can contain germs like Salmonella, E. coli O157, and norovirus[4].","['He also writes, ""Domesticated animals selectively bred by us are a different case. My dog, for example, cannot clean his hindquarters because he is too short and stocky in the body; we have to check that he is clean after he has defecated. Similarly, sheep have to be inspected regularly because their body shape prevents them from keeping themselves clean. Many species, humans included, have adapted their front legs to be hands—helpful for self-grooming. The use of plant material to clean the anal area would have been an evolutionary adaptation.

This enables us to walk tall with our hands free, but it also comes at a price: we experience problems with our back and joints, and the whole business of evacuating our waste is more difficult. The fundamental problem is that the area used for releasing urine and faeces is compressed between thighs and buttocks, so we are more likely than other animals to foul ourselves. We also differ from other animals in our response to our waste, which we tend to regard with disgust.

How come humans have been able to domestic wolves and animals like that but haven't been able to do it with big cats,"Wolves have been able to be domesticated because they came to humans, not the other way around[1][5]. It is likely that humans and wolves would compete for large prey, especially during leaner, winter months, but instead of killing each other, humans domesticated the wolves[3]. This could be because wolves would have been seen as a useful hunting companion, although humans were successful hunters on their own[2]. It is also possible that wolves were domesticated because modern humans had already wiped out most of the large carnivores that existed, including saber-toothed cats and giant hyenas[1]. On the other hand, big cats have not been domesticated because they do not need humans to survive, and they can cause grave injury to humans, especially as they mature[4].","[""But when we look back at our relationship with wolves throughout history, this doesn't really make sense. For one thing, the wolf was domesticated at a time when modern humans were not very tolerant of carnivorous competitors. In fact, after modern humans arrived in Europe around 43,000 years ago, they pretty much wiped out every large carnivore that existed, including saber-toothed cats and giant hyenas. The fossil record doesn't reveal whether these large carnivores starved to death because modern humans took most of the meat or whether humans picked them off on purpose. Either way, most of the Ice Age bestiary went extinct."", ""It's also not likely that humans took in adult wolves to serve as skilled hunting companions. Wolves are great hunters, but humans were successful hunters on their own, so they wouldn't have been looking for extra help. Plus, humans have a long history of trying to eradicate wolves rather than caring for them."", 'Historically, humans and wolves were both pack hunters, and would compete for large prey, especially during leaner, winter months. But while the two species were capable of killing each other, humans instead domesticated wolves, whose descendents eventually became our dogs.', ""Since wolves are the long-ago relative of dogs, some people might think they can be taken in as pets. While a small research study indicates that wolf pups raised by people can get attached to them, these wild animals don't turn into adorable human companions. They haven't been domesticated over thousands of years like dogs. Wolves don't need our help to survive, and they can cause grave injury to humans, especially as they mature."", ""Unlike the where and when, researchers generally agree on how and why wolves were domesticated. You may be surprised to hear that domestication happened because wolves came to humans and not the other way around. As sweet as it is to imagine a kindhearted hunter coming across an adorable pack of lonely wolf puppies and adopting them, this wasn't the case.""]"
Genetic manipulation of chickens for commercial purposes,"Genetic manipulation of chickens is the process of breeding generations of birds to maximize the profit of the animal agriculture industry[1][2]. This differs from genetic engineering, which is the use of modern technology to edit a genetic structure[2][4]. Genetic modification of poultry genomes has great potential for improving poultry production, and it has been used to produce transgenic birds that express recombinant human proteins in hen eggs, as well as tissue-specific genes as an animal model[1]. This has applications in agriculture, biopharmacology, and avian biology[1]. For example, AviGenics has created transgenic roosters which have successfully passed on to new generations of chicks the human gene for a substance called alpha interferon[5]. However, genetic engineering also has its drawbacks. For chickens, the welfare consequences have been devastating, as it has created non-functional creatures who are perennially plagued with pain[4].","['Over the past two decades numerous reports have demonstrated that the genetic modification of poultry genomes has great potential for improving poultry production; moreover, it may be used as a powerful tool for the production of industrial proteins. To date, transgenic techniques have been established for generating transgenic birds that express recombinant human proteins in hen eggs, as well as tissue-specific genes as an animal model. The production of transgenic birds is a promising approach that could have practical applications in agriculture and biopharmacology, in addition to advancing our understanding of avian biology. Finally, germ cell–mediated transgenesis could provide a more efficient strategy for creating gene-targeted insertions and deletions in avian species.', 'An observant consumer might have noticed that over the last several decades chicken breasts on supermarket shelves have grown larger and appear more marbled. These changes are the result of genetic modification, a method through which generations of birds are bred to maximize the profit of the animal agriculture industry, with scant regard given to their welfare. This process is distinct from genetic engineering, which is the use of modern technology to edit a genetic structure.', 'The generation of genetically modified chickens has wide applications in agricultural and biomedical research (Sang, 1994; Ivarie, 2003; Mozdziak and Petitte, 2004).

Different methods used for gene editing in chickens and the generated chicken lines were stated earlier in this review. In addition, the worldwide availability of genetically modified chicken lines is summarized in Table 2.', 'Genetic engineering is a reality of modern farming. For chickens, the welfare consequences have been devastating. We have created non-functional creatures, who are perennially plagued with pain, whose sole purpose is to produce and die. This example shows us the danger of GMO technology. It may appear to have great benefits, but it will certainly come with costs, some of which may be too hard to bear.', 'AviGenics claims to have already created transgenic roosters which have successfully passed on to new generations of chicks the human gene for a substance called alpha interferon, used to treat hepatitis and certain cancers.']"
What will it take to stop ivory poachers? Why are they killing rhinos and elephants so successfully?,"Stopping ivory poachers will require a multi-pronged strategy that includes direct species protection work such as training and equipping rangers and community scouts to monitor and protect wildlife, deploying dog-and-handler units to track down poachers, and helping governments manage protected areas[1]. It is also necessary to end the demand for elephant ivory in order to reduce elephant poaching and alleviate the strain on local populations and enforcement agents[3]. In addition, there needs to be concerted action from governments to close ivory markets and ban elephant ivory trade[5]. Poachers are killing rhinos and elephants so successfully because they are equipped with military-grade weapons, helicopters, and night-vision goggles[2]. They also cause a great deal of pain to the animals, as rhinos may have their horns cut off while they are still alive, and elephants are hacked for their tusks[4].","['AWF’s three-pronged strategy — Stop the Killing, Stop the Trafficking, and Stop the Demand — fights poaching from every angle.

Poaching in Africa today involves militias, crime networks, and even terrorist groups motivated by the demand for ivory and rhino horn in Asian countries predominantly. The illegal killing of wildlife is more efficient than ever before — the syndicates equip poachers with gear such as military-grade weapons, helicopters, and night-vision goggles. In one of the worst events on record, armed poachers on horseback in Cameroon’s Bouba N’djida National Park slaughtered as many as 650 elephants over three months in early 2012.', '- Ending the demand for elephant ivory will reduce elephant poaching and alleviate the strain that poaching puts on local populations and enforcement agents.', '- Elephants and rhinos often experience painful deaths when poached.

The United States implemented a near-total ban on elephant ivory trade in 2016, and the United Kingdom, Singapore, Hong Kong, and other elephant ivory markets followed suit. Most significantly, China took the remarkable step of closing its legal domestic ivory market at the end of 2017.

Why do wild animal mothers (like bison) sometimes reject their young if they have been in contact with humans?,"Wild animal mothers (like bison) sometimes reject their young if they have been in contact with humans because human contact can lead the mother to reject the baby[1]. Additionally, some large mammals will reject the second or 'insurance' infant simply because they do not have the means to nurse it[3]. Rejection and abandonment of offspring can also happen in captive animals due to too much human handling[4], and wildlife may be rejected by their parents if they have contact with humans, making them more vulnerable to predators or other harmful situations[5].","['Park regulations dictate that visitors refrain from contact with all wild animals as a safety measure. In the case of young animals, human contact also can lead mother animals to reject their babies. But even when humans are not involved, bison mothers — especially young ones — will sometimes abandon their calves, which then typically succumb to predators or to starvation, the Yellowstone representative noted.', '""In addition, interference by people can cause mothers to reject their offspring. In this case, park rangers tried repeatedly to reunite the newborn bison calf with the herd. These efforts failed.', 'Unfortunately, like us humans, not all animals are suited to the demands of parenthood. Some mothers, through no lack of love, will reject or abandon their offspring shortly after birth. There are a number of reasons why this happens and great variations between domestic and wild animals. Some large mammals will reject the second or ‘insurance’ infant simply because they do not have the means to nurse it.', 'While we are more acquainted with rejection in the wild animal kingdom, with captive animals often rejecting their young because of too much human handling, rejection and abandonment of offspring in domestic animals is lesser known.', 'Although many wildlife appear tame, they are not. It’s best to resist the urge to pet and hold them. In fact, some animals, from bison to birds, may be rejected by their parents if they have contact with humans, making them more vulnerable to predators or other harmful situations. In addition, wildlife can get injured when they try to escape people who have gotten too close, especially if they are near human structures or roads. Wildlife that get used to being around people and developed areas such as picnic areas and campgrounds also are at greater risk of eating human food and catching diseases from people and pets or giving diseases to humans and their pets.']"
"Lab grown meat, does it take as long to grow as the animal?","Lab-grown meat typically takes 2-8 weeks to grow, depending on the type of meat cells[4]. This process starts with the extraction of cells from a living animal and those cells are then placed in a bioreactor and fed with serums rich in oxygen and nutrients[3][4]. Different proteins are added to the cells to differentiate them into fat and muscle cells[3][4]. Additionally, the progress of lab-grown meat has increased drastically in recent years, as more than $1 billion has been poured into the industry by investors in 2020[5].","['Lab-grown meat is grown using cells taken from an animal, so it is virtually the same thing as meat taken from an animal raised on a factory farm, except the animal did not need to die for us to eat it. Those who have tried lab-grown meat often remark on its similarity to farm-raised meat.', 'Lab-grown meat, or cultured meat, is like the meat sourced from animals raised on factory farms in that it is made up of real animal cells. The difference is that whereas the meat cells sourced directly from animal bodies are grown in a process that has massive negative environmental and animal welfare consequences, lab-grown meat cells mature and grow in a laboratory with much smaller animal welfare and environmental impacts.', 'Lab-grown meat typically starts with the extraction of cells from a living animal. This process causes only a momentary discomfort for the animal. Those cells are then placed into a concoction of different nutrients where they multiply and create the sinews of real meat. Production facility staff are then able to use this tissue to make a variety of different meat cuts.', 'Let’s take a brief look at how cultured meat is produced. First, a tissue sample is taken from a donor animal and stem cells are isolated from it. These cells are then placed in a bioreactor– a large tank in which biological reactions happen. The cells are then fed with serums rich in oxygen and nutrients in the bioreactor. These serums are called growth media. By adding different proteins to the cells, they are differentiated into fat and muscle cells. This process takes about 2-8 weeks, depending on the type of meat cells. If whole cuts are produced (as compared to ground meat products), the process includes extra steps for adding texture (Figure 2).', 'It has been almost 10 years since the last article about lab-grown meat was published on Science in the News. Back then, the lack of funding and attention was named as one of the main bottlenecks for progress. This has changed drastically. More than $1bn was poured into the industry by investors in 2020 alone, and not a month passes by without a media release on another alleged scientific breakthrough (see for example here, here, and here).']"
Why do vegetables taste worse compared to meat/fat if it is healthier for our body?,"Vegetables tend to taste worse compared to meat and fat because fat helps contribute to the mouthfeel of the food, distributing the tastes of the food to more of your tastebuds and making the food’s flavor both more intense and lasting[2]. Additionally, diets higher in high-quality plant proteins such as legumes, soy, and nuts result in lower levels of both total and LDL (“bad”) cholesterol compared to diets with red meat[4], which may explain why vegetables taste worse compared to meat and fat, as red meat has been linked to higher levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoproteins, and blood pressure.","['- Researchers found that when diets with red meat were compared with all other types of diets combined, there were no significant differences in total cholesterol, lipoproteins, or blood pressure, although diets higher in red meat did lead to higher triglyceride concentrations than the comparison diets.', 'The very first thing that happens when you eat fat? Your mouth gets happy. “Fats help contribute to the mouthfeel of the food by coating the mouth and helping you savor the food longer,” Colleen Tewksbury, Ph.D., M.P.H., R.D., a senior research investigator and bariatric program manager at Penn Medicine and president-elect of the Pennsylvania Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, tells SELF. This enhanced mouthfeel helps distribute whatever tastes the fat molecules are carrying with them to more of your tastebuds, where they can linger for longer—making the food’s flavor both more intense and lasting. (Think heavenly garlic-infused olive oil, for instance.) There is also research suggesting we may have specialized taste receptors for the taste of fat itself, similarly to how we do for sweetness and saltiness.', '- Another study—the first meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials looking at the health effects of red meat by substituting it for other specific types of foods—found that diets that replaced red meat with healthy plant proteins led to decreases in risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

Why did older films always have a scene devoted to somebody singing?,"During the silent era, live music was often played to accompany the films[1][2][3][4]. This was seen as an essential part of the viewing experience and some countries even devised other ways to bring sound to the films, like having singers performing behind the screen (Brazil) or having live narrators (Japan)[3]. The term ""silent film"" is a retronym, created to distinguish it from later sound films[2][4]. Organists or pianists used sheet music, often adding improvisational flourishes, and they also sometimes used sound effects from theater organs to heighten the drama[2][5].","[""Some films draw a direct contrast between the silent film era and the era of talkies. Sunset Boulevard shows the disconnect between the two eras in the character of Norma Desmond, played by silent film star Gloria Swanson, and Singin' in the Rain deals with Hollywood artists adjusting to the talkies. Peter Bogdanovich's 1976 film Nickelodeon deals with the turmoil of silent filmmaking in Hollywood during the early 1910s, leading up to the release of D. W. Griffith's epic The Birth of a Nation (1915)."", 'The term ""silent film"" is something of a misnomer, as these films were almost always accompanied by live sounds. During the silent era that existed from the mid-1890s to the late 1920s, a pianist, theater organist—or even, in large cities, a small orchestra—would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would play either from sheet music, or improvisation. Sometimes a person would even narrate the inter-title cards for the audience. Though at the time the technology to synchronize sound with the film did not exist, music was seen as an essential part of the viewing experience. ""Silent film"" is typically used as a historical term to describe an era of cinema prior to the invention of synchronized sound, but it also applies to such sound-era films as City Lights,, Modern Times, Silent Movie and The Artist, which are accompanied by a music-only soundtrack in place of dialogue.', 'A number of countries devised other ways of bringing sound to silent films. The early cinema of Brazil, for example, featured fitas cantatas (singing films), filmed operettas with singers performing behind the screen. In Japan, films had not only live music but also the benshi, a live narrator who provided commentary and character voices. The benshi became a central element in Japanese film, as well as providing translation for foreign (mostly American) movies. The popularity of the benshi was one reason why silent films persisted well into the 1930s in Japan. Conversely, as benshi-narrated films often lacked intertitles, modern-day audiences may sometimes find it difficult to follow the plots without specialised subtitling or additional commentary.', 'The term silent film is a retronym—a term created to retroactively distinguish something from later developments. Early sound films, starting with The Jazz Singer in 1927, were variously referred to as the ""talkies"", ""sound films"", or ""talking pictures"". The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is older than film (it was suggested almost immediately after Edison introduced the phonograph in 1877), and some early experiments had the projectionist manually adjusting the frame rate to fit the sound, but because of the technical challenges involved, the introduction of synchronized dialogue became practical only in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the advent of the Vitaphone system. Within a decade, the widespread production of silent films for popular entertainment had ceased, and the industry had moved fully into the sound era, in which movies were accompanied by synchronized sound recordings of spoken dialogue, music and sound effects.', 'When organists or pianists used sheet music, they still might add improvisational flourishes to heighten the drama on screen. Even when special effects were not indicated in the score, if an organist was playing a theater organ capable of an unusual sound effect such as ""galloping horses"", it would be used during scenes of dramatic horseback chases.']"

"how can the large internet providers claim that Netflix (or any video streaming) bandwidth costs extra? Bandwidth is bandwidth, no?","Large internet providers can claim that Netflix (or any video streaming) bandwidth costs extra because streaming video on Netflix uses a lot of data and, in order to meet increasing demand, infrastructure needs to be built out, which costs money[1]. Additionally, the bandwidth required to stream Netflix depends on the video quality, and the recommended download bandwidth for movies and TV shows on Netflix is 1.5 Mbps[3]. Furthermore, streaming 8K content would require a per hour bandwidth rate of 6.44GB – 19.2GB/hour for 23.976fps content[4], which is a high bandwidth rate. Finally, videos are the biggest consumer of bandwidth, and streaming three hours of video content generates more internet traffic than whole household consumption[5].","[""Let's start with the fun facts. First, data is not free and video uses a lot of data. Therefore, because you are streaming video on Netflix, you definitely use a lot of data. Second, your internet provider is in business to make money. That means that there's a probability of a cap in the data you use monthly and extra charges for surpassing the set amount. This causes headaches for Netflix subscribers who would like to watch much content but are limited by their data and avoidance of extra charges. Buckeye Broadband can eliminate these headaches by offering you data plans that meet your streaming needs - including unlimited data."", 'Instead, ISPs will share each others’ networks when needed, a practice called peering. ISPs say online streaming services like Netflix take up a lot of bandwidth and put a huge strain on their networks. And it takes money to build out the infrastructure to match increasing demand, Jeff Silva, a telecommunications analyst at Medley Global Advisors, told NPR.', 'The bandwidth required to stream Netflix depends on the video quality. The recommended download bandwidth for movies and TV shows on Netflix is 1.5 Mbps, 0.5 Mbps being the minimum threshold. 0.5 Mbps is just enough to start a video stream, but anything below 1.5 Mbps leads to poor video quality. As recommended by Netflix, Standard definition (SD) requires 3 Mbps, High definition (HD) 5 Mbps and 4K/Ultra HD at least 25 Mbps. You can set video quality settings to ‘Medium’ or ‘Low’ to manage Netflix bandwidth usage to use less data while streaming. According to real-world tests, in terms of per hour watching, Netflix’s actual bandwidth requirement at 1080p with 23.976fps video ranges from 1.9GB – 2.55GB and 3.5GB – 7GB for 4K.', 'Even with an 8K streaming service, most people wouldn’t be able to use it. Platforms like Netflix specifies a 25 Mbps stream for 4K content. This requirement seems to quadruple as there is no H.266 standard alongside 8K to reduce the file size. Netflix consumes 3.1GB/hour at 1080p for 60fps video and even 7GB/hour at 4K. If we assume that the transition from 4K to 8K consumes an equivalent amount of bandwidth to 1080p – 4K transition, the per hour bandwidth requirement to stream 8K content would be nearly 6.44GB – 19.2GB/hour for 23.976fps content. This is still a high bandwidth rate to burn out.', 'Internet capacity is robust, but now that we’re all working from home, there has been a massive increase in global internet consumption beyond its usual spike. In 2020, The European Union called on streaming services like YouTube and Netflix to scale back their offering to prevent broadband networks from crashing. This means offering videos in SD rather than HD to reduce global bandwidth consumption. Videos are by far the biggest consumer of bandwidth and as per the CISCO report, streaming three hours of video content generates more Internet traffic than whole household consumption. This is how important video bandwidth is.']"
Why do insects and other creatures eat their mate after the act of mating?,"Sexual cannibalism is done by many different animals and insects after mating for a few reasons. One is that the male body may provide nourishment to the pregnant female[2]. Another is that the female may mistake the male for prey[2]. Additionally, it can also be a way for the female to ensure the survival of her offspring[2][4]. It is also true for semelparous animals, who die after mating[4], such as male antechinus and male brown widow spiders, who offer themselves as living sacrifices to their mates[4]. Finally, animals don't think of sex as an act of intimacy the way humans do, and may be more likely to eat their mate after mating[5].","['Despite the ferocity of mating in the animal kingdom, romance is not dead: sexual cannibalism can be something of a gift from the male to the female in many cases. Female wolf spiders and tarantulas, who often eat males pre-intercourse, produce 30% more eggs than those who don’t when they finally get around to mating. And in the mantis’ case, the death of one male often means the survival of the reproducing female.', 'Sexual cannibalism is done by many different animals and insects after mating. While it’s not truly known why some species do so, there are a few guesses, such as the male body providing nourishment to the pregnant female or the female mistaking the male for prey. To many, sexual cannibalism might sound horrifying, but for many species it’s one of their only ways to ensure survival.', 'It’s not just spiders that eat their mates after sex. Biologists have documented female anacondas strangling their mates after mating, likely to use as food later. Like many species where sexual cannibalism occurs, female anacondas are much bigger than males, making it easier for them to overpower their mates.', 'That’s certainly not true for every species (humans, for example) but it does bear out for what biologists call semelparous animals — those that die after mating. Many plant species die after reproducing, as well as animals like salmon and male antechinus. It’s also true for male brown widow spiders, who offer themselves as living sacrifices to females. During mating, a male will place its abdomen near the fangs of the soon-to-be mother of its children. The female will consume her mate, using his body as sustenance for her children.', 'Also, animals don’t really think of sex as an act of intimacy the way humans do. We tend to think of mating and eating as completely separate acts, Scheel says. “But octopuses are predators, and they’re not opposed to eating each other in non-mating contexts.” Even if that non-mating context is minutes after the mating context.']"
Why aren't we just storing the DNA of and cloning near extinct animals ?,"While cloning near-extinct animals could be a potential tool for preserving the Earth's biological diversity, it is not a viable solution in many cases[1]. Cloning is expensive and may not be as effective as traditional conservation efforts[2]. Additionally, conservation cloning is a tool of last resort and is only suitable for species that are descended from just a few individuals or species that are in danger of going extinct now[4]. Even if cloning is successful, it could lead to proxies that differ from the extinct form in unknown and unpredictable ways[2][5].","[""Noah's birth, and the possible creation of a new Celia, could show cloning to be a powerful tool for preserving the Earth's biological diversity. With hundreds and possibly thousands of species disappearing each year, cloning advocates hope that their work will persuade zoos and wildlife managers to collect and freeze cells from endangered animals. Cloning could not only revive species that disappear, they say, but save those that mate poorly in captivity, such as the giant panda, a zoo favorite."", 'If you have frozen tissues from a lot of different individuals, you might be able to avoid this issue or even reintroduce genetic variation that’s been lost, but that will depend on what you’ve stockpiled. The real problem with cloning endangered animals is that it won’t stop the poachers, habitat loss, or myriad other things driving these species extinct in the first place. Cloning is very expensive, and some researchers have pointed out it’s probably cheaper and more effective to spend that money on fighting poaching, creating new nature reserves, or other, more traditional conservation efforts.', ""We know how to clone animals, so why aren't we saving endangered species by cloning their populations?"", ""Conservation cloning is a tool of last resort. Its most promising uses are either for species that are descended from just a handful of individuals, known as a genetic bottleneck, or species that are in danger of going extinct now. Even though Elizabeth Ann's birth demonstrates cloning's potential hope for at-risk mammals, it’s a different story when it comes to avian conservation."", 'But even if cloning is someday more successful, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), it could also lead to proxies “that differ in unknown and unpredictable ways from the extinct form.” For example, researchers may not know everything about potential epigenomic differences affecting DNA activity or the microbiome needed to support the species’ health. They also may not be able to recreate the exact learning environment in which the original species was reared, which could cause the behavior of the de-extinct species to deviate from that of the original.']"
"Once organs are harvested, how are they kept ""alive"" before being transplanted.","Once organs are harvested, they are kept alive before being transplanted by maintaining blood flow and a stable temperature.

Additionally, organs can only be taken from certain deceased donors that have died under very specific circumstances[3]. The transplant team will then determine what organs and tissues can be used based on their clinical evaluation[3].","['Most organs need to be used very soon after death to ensure they remain suitable for transplantation and the person who has died is not deprived of the opportunity to donate. Once a family had consented to organ donation and accepted that their loved one had died, they said goodbye and then, in most cases, left the hospital. Saying goodbye, understandably, was distressing and traumatic. Added to this was the shock that comes with sudden illness or injury - for this person had been healthy and active only days earlier. Achieving a comfortable and dignified death had been crucial and many relatives had wanted to be present when the patient died. Some people had asked for the hospital chaplain or their own vicar to read the last rites.', 'Missing context.

And guess what? So do many omnivores. B12 experts advise all people over the age of 50 to get vitamin B12 through supplements or fortified foods. (7) This is because changes that occur with aging make it harder to absorb B12 from the animal foods in which it occurs naturally. But the B12 in supplements and fortified foods is in a form that is more easily absorbed. It’s believed that many of the issues associated with aging—such as problems with hearing and memory—are due to suboptimal B12.

"Why is cosmetics testing on animals always so abusive?

"I've never seen people taking cats out for a walk on a leash, whereas people take out dogs all the time. why is that so? does it have to do something with the way cats have evolved?","It is generally not recommended to take cats out for a walk on a leash, despite some owners successfully training their cats to do so. This is because cats do not have the same desire to socialize with others and do not behave the same as dogs on a leash[1][2]. They may be exposed to unfamiliar scents or experiences that may be frightening and cause stress and agitation[2]. Instead, providing cats with a cat-proof enclosure or enclosed yard with cat-proof fencing is recommended by the RSPCA[1][2]. Some people believe that walking cats on a leash can provide exercise and sources of enrichment[2][3], and if done properly, it can be done safely with a harness rather than a collar[5]. Training should start as a kitten and should be done indoors first, with outdoor excursions limited to the safety of a back yard[5].","['Unlike dogs, cats do not have the same desire to socialise with others but they do enjoy smelling and exploring their surroundings. Also, cats do not behave the same as dogs on a leash. Rather than responding to cues such as sit or heel, you will tend to follow your cat’s lead as they wander around. Walks should be kept brief. Rather than using a harness and leash to provide access to the outdoors, the RSPCA recommends providing your cat with a cat-proof enclosure or enclosed yard with cat-proof fencing. This allows your cat to enjoy the outdoors in a safe and secure setting, without the risks involved with walking your cat on a leash.', 'Although RSPCA policy is that a leash and harness may be used to walk cats outside the owner’s property under direct supervision and despite some owners successfully training their cat to walk on a leash, in general the RSPCA does not recommend it. This is because walking outdoors exposes cats to unfamiliar scents they may find threatening, and to potentially frightening experiences, including dogs, strange people, loud noises and cars. When alarmed, cats typically attempt to hide somewhere or to escape by climbing whatever is available, such as a tree or even up onto their owner. Most cats like to be in control – therefore, new environments can cause stress and agitation. Any cat who is easily stressed is best provided with other opportunities for outdoor exercise and enrichment, such as an escape-proof enclosure.', 'Indoor cats need exercise and sources of enrichment to prevent obesity, boredom and the development of unwanted behaviours. Some people believe that walking their cat on a leash will provide this, particularly when they have no other access to the outdoors. There are a range of cat harnesses and leashes readily available and some animal behaviourists provide advice about how to train cats to be walked using these.', ""Once you have successfully taught your cat to walk on a leash and harness inside — and they are comfortable with it — continue the training work outside. You can learn more about that in How to Train Your Cat to Walk on a Leash. As they get comfortable, take them through any commands they've learned and provide lots of positive reinforcement as they expand their territory, smell new things, and hear new sounds. But keep in mind that in a tense situation, cats are more likely to act on instinct rather than follow a cue or look to their human for direction."", 'If you do decide to walk your cat on a leash, it is crucial that you attach this to a harness rather than a collar. Cats can easily slip out of collars or may choke if they escape and become entangled. Also, a proper cat harness rather than a dog harness should be used as these are more comfortable and secure. Ideally, training to walk on a leash and harness should start as a kitten. A good approach is to begin indoors and use treats and praise to slowly introduce the sensation of being restrained.

Why do heating up metals help remove screws if screw and metal swells in heat simultaneously?,"Heating up metals helps remove screws because heat causes the metal to expand, and as the metal swells simultaneously, the expansion of the material the bolt is screwed into can push into the cavity, decreasing the tension on the thread and making it easier to remove the screw[5]. Additionally, heat does not travel instantly, so the nut will expand more than the bolt if timed correctly[2], and the nut may get much hotter than the bolt due to air being a better insulator[3].","['-1 this answer is absurd, you\'re claiming the screw shrinks back to smaller than it was at the same temperature!? If that were true, it would be possible to make metal of any density by heating/cooling it in smaller and smaller holes. The real answer is probably ""expansion of the hole (due to heat conduction), plus uneven expansion breaking any bonds caused by rust""', 'Because heat does not travel instantly, the nut will expand more than the bolt... if you time things right... which is not trivial. For a bearing rather than a nut/bolt, this [induction] heating is an industry method of removal, as shown in this video for example, and even more so for affixing. The removal action is instantaneous in this case, once the bearing ring is heated enough. The issue with a nut/bolt is that a lot of heat may have transferred to the bolt, perhaps before you are done removing the nut. Quoting from a practitioner of this art ""you want to heat the nut and not the bolt"".', ""The issue is further compounded by the fact that there isn't one single method of doing this. You can see in this other video that the nut gets much whiter than the bolt, which means it gets much hotter when heated. The catch is that by the time the nut is removed, neither is glowing anymore [in that last video], so we can't visually tell their temperature [difference]. Air however is a much better insulator, so I suspect that the bolt cools faster than the nut because it makes contact with more metal, which acts as a radiator. A video with a thermal camera would be definite proof, but I couldn't find one. The description of that last video also says that corrosive bonds are loosened by heating which may well be true as well, but I haven't checked the science on this bit; this claim also assumes that those bonds are not immediately restored by cooling."", 'What does heat do to metal? The expansion (or contraction) of any material is due to the kinetic energy of its atoms. When a material is heated, the increase in energy causes the atoms and molecules to move more and to take up more space— that is, to expand.', 'This is totally the correct answer, which sucks because its at the bottom with 0 votes, and all the other answers about a difference in expansion are just garbage. Whatever your bolt/nut material, and whatever you heat up more, expansion of the material the bolt is screwed into will expand in to the cavity, not expand the size of the cavity. The heating/cooling argument might make sense, but I really doubt the effects are significant. Plus its not what people do. No, the reason is because hot metal has far less spring tension on the thread, which is what is actually holding the bolt in.']"

Another theory is that a low level of poison in the fruit encourages fruit-eating animals to move away from the parent plant, thus carrying seeds further away[4].

Additionally, some people argue that the Agreement is too flexible, with few controls on how its members meet their commitments[3], and that due to renegotiations led by the U.S, there are difficulties with jobs and disadvantages for certain industries[4]. Lastly, the Agreement is not enough to prevent the global average temperature from rising 1.5°C, which will result in devastating consequences[5].","['“The Paris Agreement is not enough. Even at the time of negotiation, it was recognized as not being enough,” says CFR’s Hill. “It was only a first step, and the expectation was that as time went on, countries would return with greater ambition to cut their emissions.”', '- The Paris Agreement limit won’t protect all countries and locations from the strong negative impacts of climate change. For vulnerable climates close to deserts, such as the Sahel region of Africa, the climate targets don’t go far enough to protect the people living there.', 'It might seem like the Paris Agreement is a very loose arrangement, with few controls on how its members meet their commitments. In fact, this very flexibility, combined with regular, transparent sharing of information, is a big reason the Agreement was able to win approval by nearly every country in the world. “It succeeded in getting universal participation and agreement to these obligations of conduct,” says Mehling. “And it’s also open-ended. Where the Kyoto Protocol [the previous UN international treaty to fight climate change] was restricted to a short time period, this agreement creates a strong framework to have ongoing negotiations, and to set expectations with long-term targets that will keep us on track.”', 'These reasons don’t all add up, however. The countries that signed the Paris Agreement already consider it a renegotiated version of the Kyoto Protocol, and these renegotiations were largely led by the U.S. Difficulties with jobs and disadvantages for certain industries don’t depend on the contents of the Agreement, but on the way that the U.S. decides to meet its own targets. Lastly, Trump’s discomfort with its weighted responsibility for climate change denies the cumulative contributions the U.S. has made to climate change.', '- Experts say the Paris Agreement is not enough to prevent the global average temperature from rising 1.5°C.

Why does something like cocoa powder dissolve in hot liquids but not cold liquids?,"Cocoa powder does not dissolve but disperses in hot liquids and cold liquids[1]. When hot chocolate powder is mixed with cold milk, the molecules in hot chocolate powder move faster than those in cold milk, making it more likely to dissolve in hot liquids[1][2]. However, the rate of dissolution can vary depending on the type of chocolate powder[4]. Additionally, when the cocoa powder cools down, the solubility of the hot chocolate powder is reduced, which causes the powder to precipitate and collect at the bottom of the mug[2][5].","['Your point is that cocoa powder does not dissolve but disperses into milk or water (or both). Dissolving substances with cocoa powder is not compatible with dissolving them using standard methods. When hot chocolate powder is mixed with cold milk, the molecules in hot chocolate powder move faster than those in cold milk. When the sugar in hot chocolate powder is dissolved in hot milk, it dissolves much more quickly than when the sugar in cold chocolate powder is dissolved. If you want to dissolve something in hot milk, use a warmer milk instead of the hot one. Warmer milk contains more molecules, allowing it to dissolve more easily than cooler milk. If you want to dissolve a substance in cold milk, it is preferable to use cold milk. Cold milk has fewer molecules than warm milk, making it less likely to dissolve a substance.', 'Hot chocolate powder dissolves faster in hot water because it is a liquid in a room at room temperature. When heated, the water molecules move faster than the chocolate particles, causing the hot chocolate powder to dissolve more quickly than the chocolate particles. If you’re making hot or cold chocolate, combine cocoa powder and sugar and then add boiling water to the mixture. Our hot chocolate contains cocoa solids, which are small chocolate chips. Water repels Cocoa Butter because it is hydrophobic. When you put hot chocolate in a mug with starch, it loses its heat quickly.', 'No, it is not a good idea at all. It will be worse, not better. What you are missing here is that cocoa powder does not dissolve at all, never, it just disperses in water (or milk). So there is no reason why methods for dissolving stuff would work with cocoa powder. You will need to use a method created for colloid-producing powders like cocoa powder, which is mostly starch with fat.', 'In general, chocolate powder does dissolve in hot water. However, the rate of dissolution can vary depending on the type of chocolate powder. For example, Dutch-processed cocoa powder dissolves more slowly than natural cocoa powder.', ""If you've made hot cocoa with powder, you've probably experienced the dark sludge at the bottom of the cup. This chocolate goop seems unavoidable, despite being absolutely certain that you dissolved all the powder when you first stirred your drink. For years I thought I was just a bad stirrer, but it turns out that the sludge actually forms as the drink cools down. As the hot cocoa cools, the solubility of the hot chocolate powder is reduced. This means that the amount of powder you can dissolve in a mug full of water or milk is lessened. So, as the temperature falls, the powder precipitates and collects at the bottom of your mug leaving the hard-to-clean but delicious chocolate goop.""]"
Why does everyone blame the United States for the current state of the world?,"The United States is often blamed for the current state of the world because of its overwhelming power and influence. This power has been criticized for being misused in two endless wars, underplaying Russia and China's ambitions, and not taking the initiative to shift the balance of blame. Additionally, the United States is seen as having a favorable geographic position with no enemies nearby, and a large innovative economy[4]. Finally, its perceived unilateral responsibility for the cold war and the potential for accidental misinterpretation of espionage planes as atomic attackers has also contributed to the blame placed on the United States[5].","['The first question I want to consider is, what went wrong? We were very optimistic back in the 1990s about where the world was headed. That doesn’t seem to be the world we’re inhabiting today. I’ll try to lay out my views on what went wrong there. I’ve been arguing that we deserve a lot of the blame, that the United States is responsible for a lot of it. Not all of it by any means, but a lot.', 'At this juncture, the point about the balance of blame that I want most to make is that if the United States will now take the initiative, in a manner I shall presently describe, there are good reasons to believe that the Soviet Union will quickly follow suit.

"Our ancestors started farming other animals for resources, so why didn't this happen with elephants?","There are several reasons why elephants weren't farmed by our ancestors. One is that they reproduce slowly and have few offspring compared to small animals like rabbits, which makes them vulnerable to overharvesting. Other species were employed for human purposes but were never fully domesticated, such as elephants being used for heavy work in India as early as 2,000 B.C[3]. The archaeological and fossil records suggest that humans pursued farming only after they had little alternative, likely because they wiped out their own food supply by hunting horses and mammoths too effectively[4]. Finally, the disappearance of the animals our ancestors depended on for food may have forced their culture to evolve and transition from hunter-gatherer life to plant harvesting, then cultivation and, finally, cities[5].","['but because you’d have to grow other animals just to feed them. The best animals to farm are large, plant-eating mammals. And over the years, humans have probably tried to domesticate all of them, usually without success. Despite repeated efforts, Africans have never domesticated the elephant.', 'Harvesting big game like horses, camels and elephants produces a better return than hunting small game like rabbits. But large animals like elephants reproduce slowly, and have few offspring compared to small animals like rabbits, making them vulnerable to overharvesting. And so everywhere we went, our human ingenuity – hunting with spear-throwers, herding animals with fire, stampeding them over cliffs – meant we harvested large animals faster than they could replenish their numbers. It was arguably the first sustainability crisis.', 'Other species, while never being fully domesticated, have been employed to serve human purposes. For example, there is evidence of elephants being used for heavy work in India as early as 2,000 B.C. They might have used in the South Asia region for thousands of years earlier than that.', 'The archaeological and fossil records tell us our ancestors could have pursued farming, but did only so after they had little alternative. We probably would have continued hunting horses and mammoths forever, but we were just too good at it, and likely wiped out our own food supply.', 'We transitioned from hunter-gatherer life to plant harvesting, then cultivation and, finally, cities. Strikingly, this transition happened only after the ice age megafauna – mammoths, giant ground sloths, giant deer and horses – disappeared. The reasons humans began farming still remain unclear, but the disappearance of the animals we depended on for food may have forced our culture to evolve.']"
How do musicians and record labels know that Spotify/AppleMusic is not falsifying the number of plays in order to cut costs?,"Musicians and record labels have a few ways to make sure Spotify/AppleMusic is not falsifying the number of plays in order to cut costs. The first is that Spotify pays out royalties on a pro rata basis, so if ""fake artists"" are paid lower contractual royalty rates then it indicates that Spotify is attempting to keep more money[1]. Another is that major record companies are creating their own suspicious ""mood"" playlists, so they can monitor the streams of the fake artists. Additionally, research has shown that the 50 ""fake artists"" outed by MBW in 2017 had a total stream count of approximately 520 million plays[3], so it is possible to track the number of plays. Lastly, the fact that Spotify is willing to replace major label artists with fake, potentially cheaper alternatives is a useful stick for record labels during negotiations[4].","['Why? Because Spotify pays out royalties on a pro rata basis. This means – as explained on Rolling Stone previously – that the firm divides its total industry payout across the entirety of artists on its platform, based on their portion of overall streams. The important bit: if “fake artists” are paid lower contractual royalty rates than “real” acts, and then, driven by playlist inclusion, claim a certain percentage of Spotify’s total monthly streams, Spotify ends up keeping more money. An ex-Spotify insider was once quoted by Variety as suggesting that this was a deliberate company strategy: “It’s one of a number of internal initiatives to lower the royalties [Spotify is] paying to the major labels,” they said.', 'Interestingly, now the large record companies – who have been complaining about the “fake artist” practice for two years – might be adopting a “if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em” approach. Playlisting expert Kieron Donoghue recently spotted that Sony Music had launched a suspicious “mood” playlist on Spotify and Apple Music – “Sleep & Mindfulness Thunderstorms” – via the company’s Filtr brand. On Spotify, “Sleep & Mindfulness Thunderstorms” contains over 990 tracks, adding up to more than 18 hours of audio, mainly consisting of continuous storm sounds chopped into minute-long consecutive segments.', 'When MBW’s story broke, some dismissed the importance of “fake artists” to Spotify’s economic status, suggesting that the total amount of streams accumulated by these acts wasn’t large enough to have a material impact on the firm’s bottom line. In 2017, the 50 “fake artists” outed by MBW – a snapshot of the total number on the platform – had a total stream count of approximately 520 million plays.', 'The significance of “fake artists” on Spotify doesn’t stop at the commercial numbers, either. As previously reported, the service is set to renegotiate its global deals with the three major music rightsholders (Universal, Sony and Warner) over the course of 2019. The knowledge that Spotify is willing to “bump” major label artists from some of its powerful first-party “mood” and “activity” playlists – replacing them with faker, potentially cheaper, alternatives – is, prospectively, a useful stick with which to beat the majors during these talks.', '- In March, we covered Spotify’s It’s time to play fair campaign where the company laid out reasons it felt Apple wasn’t playing fair. Like most services, Apple obligates Spotify to pay a 30% cut in order to use in-app purchases when signing up new subscribers (it drops to 15% in year two of the subscription). Ultimately, Spotify wanted the EU to probe Apple Music in relation to how Apple treats its competitors vs its own business.']"
Why writers/critics use such difficult language,"Writers/critics use difficult language for a variety of reasons. One is to be cautious and critical about the claims they make, and the special language or ""hedges"" they use can soften their statements to avoid criticism[1]. Another reason is that when doing academic analysis of something, writers are trying to explain ideas about ideas, which can be inherently recursive and confusing[2]. Additionally, writers may use difficult language to distinguish themselves from novice writers, and to make their point clear and emphasize its importance.","['In academic settings, writers need to be cautious and critical about the claims they make. With the help of the special language, called “hedges”, writers can soften their statements to avoid criticism for being radical or overconfident. Consider this example:', 'The second big reason that art/book/movie criticism or academic criticism is worse than normal jargon is that if you\'re doing some kind of academic analysis of something you\'re already on a kind of meta-level --- you\'re trying to explain ideas about ideas. It\'s inherently recursive, and recursive is confusing. I mean, it\'s a struggle to parse a sentence like ""Yes, but does John know that I know that Shelia knows that I know what they did yesterday,"" and that\'s just about some bullshit gossip, not about say, proving that the Globe audience of shakespears\' time would have known X and so when the character says Y they would have thought Z and it would have suggested blah blah blah about Queen Elizabeth being a virgin, and then trying to prove that Shakespear\'s use of the virginity motif implies something about the overall meaning of Macbeth or Hamlet or what have you.', ""As for the second of Hyland's arguments, marginalizing the difficulties of novice L1 writers, I would be the first to agree that L1 writers have to struggle with their writing. I know this through personal experience and reading draft manuscripts of L1 writers. The fact that L1 writers have to struggle to get published does not mean that EAL writers, other things being equal, do not need to struggle more, however. It is true that most ERPP research and practical interventions focus on EAL writers, but this probably reflects their greater need, on the one hand, and the fact perhaps also that they have a ready constituency of applied linguists and language teachers to support them, which L1 writers do not."", 'He also mentions an Explanation 3: that gatekeepers of journals expect difficult language. This is not true: every field has some papers that are well-written.', 'To conclude this section, I have perhaps laboured the point that I want to make. However, as I have emphasized, it is important not to downplay the linguistic challenge facing EAL writers in the way that Hyland does. Other factors are of course also important, as Hyland argues, but I am not in agreement with him when he claims that linguistic difficulties are a myth and that the challenges facing EAL writers are essentially the same as those for L1 writers. This is definitely not the case, as I hope I have demonstrated.']"

Do animals without a central nervous system feel pain?,"Although animals without a central nervous system do not have the same type of nervous system as mammals, there is evidence to suggest that they can still feel pain. Overviews of the anatomy of the nervous system across the animal kingdom suggest that not only vertebrates, but also most invertebrates have the capacity to feel pain. Additionally, living things such as sponges, which do not have a nervous system like animals do, can still feel pain because what they have works like the human nervous system[3].

Why won't scientist clone the endangered species to save them from extinction.,"Scientists are hesitant to clone endangered species to save them from extinction due to a number of potential risks and drawbacks. Cloning could increase the genetic diversity of an endangered population if researchers have access to preserved DNA from many different individuals, but it could also potentially lead to more inbreeding and the introduction of harmful genetic mutations or diseases[3]. Cloning has also been unsuccessful in the past, as the cloned animals did not propagate their species. Many scientists argue that humans should focus on tackling the issues that cause biodiversity loss in the first place, rather than relying on cloning as a solution[1]. It is also important to note that collecting and preserving the genetic information of endangered animals is still valuable for basic research, even if cloning does not prove to be successful[4].","['The IUCN is predicting that by the end of the current century, nearly all critically endangered species and 67% of endangered animal species in the world could be lost forever. Some scientists say that cloning could be the best way we have to preserve endangered species and will provide humans with the means to bring extinct species back. However, many oppose cloning, saying that humans should rather stop biodiversity loss by tackling the issues that cause this in the first place. We present the main advantages and disadvantages of this revolutionary technique to answer the question of whether or now we should clone endangered species.', 'A new and controversial branch of conservation research has led scientists to explore the practicality of cloning endangered (and sometimes extinct) species in a bid to reverse the impacts of the Sixth Mass Extinction.', 'Since then some biologists have repeatedly suggested that cloning could help save endangered species, especially in dire situations in which only a few dozen or a handful of animals remain. The smaller, more homogenous and more inbred a population, the more susceptible it is to a single harmful genetic mutation or disease. Clones could theoretically increase the genetic diversity of an endangered population if researchers have access to preserved DNA from many different individuals. At the very least, clones could stabilize a shrinking population. And, some researchers argue, a genetically homogenous but stable population would be better than extinction; some highly inbred groups of wild animals, such as Chillingham cattle in England, have survived just fine for hundreds of years.', 'Teramo’s Loi remains optimistic too. He thinks that scientists should continue to collect and preserve the genetic information of endangered animals, as Brazil has done, creating bio-banks of tissue on ice, such as the ""frozen zoo"" at the San Diego Zoo’s Institute for Conservation Research.

Why have we not been able to develop a male oral contraceptive despite apparent demand and a female equivalent that has been around for over fifty years?,"There are several factors that have hindered the development of a male oral contraceptive despite the apparent demand and the existence of a female equivalent for over fifty years. These factors include challenges for funding of male methods and lack of industry involvement, disbelief that there is a real need for novel male methods, slow development of novel testosterone preparations, and the underlying physiology whereby men produce millions of sperm per day rather than releasing one oocyte per month[1]. Additionally, research suggests that the hormonal state of the menstrual cycle caused by female contraceptives like the pill could modify mate preferences and affect mate choice and reproductive outcomes[2], whereas men only have two options for contraception: male condom and vasectomy[4], neither of which are hormonal or long-acting methods. Finally, scientists have been trying for decades to develop an effective male oral contraceptive, but there are still no approved pills on the market due to the potential side effects caused by targeting the male sex hormone testosterone[5].","['More diverse methods of male contraceptives are needed to help meet the unmet contraceptive need of men and women everywhere. Research into these methods has been ongoing since the 1970s, but development has been hindered by a wide range of factors: challenges for funding of male methods and lack of industry involvement, disbelief that there is a real need for novel male methods, slow development of novel testosterone preparations, and the underlying physiology whereby men produce millions of sperm per day rather than releasing one oocyte per month. Fortunately, we are closer than ever to new hormonal methods coming to the market, and while non-hormonal methods seem at present more distant they have the potential to make a major contribution in the future.', 'The oral contraceptive pill, used by ∼100 million women of reproductive age worldwide (http://www.unpopulation.org), changes the hormonal state of the menstrual cycle by mimicking pregnancy (Box 2). Thus, mate preferences and choice could be modified by the use of such a pill (hereafter referred to as ‘the pill’; similar reasoning is applicable to any other hormone-based contraceptives, i.e. patch or implants, but empirical data concerning their influence on mate preferences are lacking). Here, we review recent evidence to discuss the possibility that contraceptive pill use in women changes mate preferences in both sexes and affects subsequent mate choice and reproductive outcomes. Modern contraception has improved the quality of life worldwide, by reducing unintended pregnancies and maternal deaths [', ""Figure 2Effect of oral contraceptive pill use on women's facial preferences for short- and long-term relationships (short-term versus long-term preferences are proxy for, e.g. relationship during fertile versus infertile menstrual cycle phase, respectively).

In contrast, men only have 2 options—male condom and vasectomy—and neither are hormonal methods or LARCs. The disparity between the number and types of female and male LARCs is problematic for at least two reasons: first, because it forces women to assume most of the financial, health-related, and other burdens of contraception, and, second, because men’s reproductive autonomy is diminished by ceding major responsibility for contraception to women. A more just contraceptive arrangement can only be achieved through the development of male LARCs and reconceptualizing the responsibility for contraception as shared between men and women .', '“Scientists have been trying for decades to develop an effective male oral contraceptive, but there are still no approved pills on the market,” says Md Abdullah Al Noman, who is presenting the work at the meeting.

Where does the pleasure from eating come from?,"The pleasure from eating comes from the experience of finding a sense of enough so that you can stop eating and move on[1]. Humans are wired to derive pleasure from food[1][2], which is created by the impulse or need to eat and the act of eating itself[3][4]. The pleasure of eating also has evolved into an art with the goal of containing, drawing out, and directing the primal necessity of nourishment[3]. Eating for enjoyment activates the body’s reward system in ways that eating to satisfy hunger doesn’t and may spur us to keep eating for pleasure[5].","['Gathering the pieces together, this picture is suggestive. The pleasure we derive from food does not come from the quantities of vitamins and minerals, or the salts or sugars present in a chemical substance. The pleasure we seek comes from participating in the process of learning how, when, what, and why to eat so that we can keep moving. The pleasure we seek comes from the experience of finding our way to a sense of enough so that we can stop eating, as we must, and keep moving.', 'It’s easy to see why: humans are wired to derive pleasure from food. In fact, for many, eating ranks among the greatest pleasures in life!', 'In the initial approach to the pleasure of food, the first signal comes in the impulse or need to eat. Later the bodily senses direct the person to a means for satisfying this impulse. Finally, distension is created in the act of eating itself. Yet culturally this simple phenomenon becomes more complex than that, since the stimulation deriving from food directly intervenes in the need to eat to the point of provoking it. Consequently the pleasure of eating has evolved into an art, the art of food consumption, with the goal to contain, draw out, and direct in a more focused and concentrated manner the primal necessity of nourishment. Unquestionably the need for satiety and for satisfying the senses plays a role in the pleasure of eating. Human and cultural contexts also add to this. Out of these conflicting sensations evolved the perceived ties between the pleasure of eating and the source of the food (such as climate and geography) as well as diverse cultural ideas defining it.', 'PLEASURE AND FOOD. The pleasure of food is the sensation of well-being that derives from the fulfillment of a natural instinct. Two essential elements are involved in food pleasure, the emotional and psychological tension created by the initial impulse or desire and the subsequent consummation of that inner need. Thus eating pleasure clearly corresponds with the two basic requirements of life, replication and sustenance.', 'Researchers from Naples and Salerno found that eating for enjoyment (what is called hedonic eating) activates the body’s reward system in ways that eating to satisfy hunger doesn’t, and may spur us to keep eating for pleasure.

Why are mice the preferred testing subject for research?,"Mice are the preferred testing subject for research due to their economical housing and husbandry needs, their brief lifespan which allows for several generations of observation in a short time, and the fact that they account for up to 95% of animal research in the United States and 79% in the European Union.

They are economical to keep since their housing and husbandry needs are easily fulfilled. And their brief lifespan means that they can procreate and offer several generations for observation in a very short time.', 'Animal research is an emotional subject, inspiring passionate debate on both sides. Although some find it uncomfortable to think about, it’s important to understand why animals like mice are used for medical science.', ""It's true: In the science community, rodents are definitely the most common test subject.

As we said earlier, use of mice and rats in the lab has grown exponentially; this growth actually might be the cause of their popularity as opposed to a consequence of it. If a scientist chooses to use a certain animal in a lab environment, it makes a lot of sense to choose the same animal when testing similar or related research.', ""Most of the mice and rats used in medical trials are inbred so they are almost identical genetically helping to make the results of medical trials more uniform.

How should a college student go about learning politics?,"College students should go about learning politics by taking courses in political science, engaging in debates about relevant topics[3], understanding the basics and etiquette of how to debate thoughtfully and civilly[3][4], and learning to analyze information in order to think critically about what they read and hear in the media in order to become a more well-informed citizen[1]. Additionally, students should recognize how politics are embedded in their algorithms and study the intended and unintended effects of political applications[5].","['Third, discussing politics in class goes beyond a review of each candidate.

Why does adding/taking away 1° to the average global temperature create a huge impact on Earth's environment?,"Adding 1° to the average global temperature can create a huge impact on Earth's environment because it affects the oceans, weather patterns, snow and ice, and plants and animals, leading to further sea level rise, extreme weather, biodiversity loss and species extinction, as well as food scarcity, worsening health and poverty worldwide. This is because the average global temperature is already increased by 1C due to the greenhouse gases released by burning of fossil fuels[3], which act like a blanket, absorbing energy and preventing it from escaping into space[4]. Without the natural greenhouse effect, the Earth’s average surface temperature would be a very chilly -18°C (0°F) instead of the comfortable 15°C (59°F) that it is today[4][5]. Therefore, even a small increase in global temperature can have drastic effects on the environment.","['- If people keep adding greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at the current rate, the average temperature around the world could increase by about 4 to 12°F by the year 2100.', ""Warmer temperatures can also lead to a chain reaction of other changes around the world.

Warming above 1.5°C risks further sea level rise, extreme weather, biodiversity loss and species extinction, as well as food scarcity, worsening health and poverty for millions of people worldwide.', 'Light from the sun passes through the atmosphere and is absorbed by the Earth’s surface, heating it up. That energy is then emitted back to the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide and methane, in the atmosphere act like a blanket, absorbing this energy and preventing it from escaping into space. In the absence of a greenhouse effect, the average temperature at the Earth’s surface would be approximately 0 degrees F, about 60 degrees F colder than Earth’s current average temperature. Thus, the greenhouse effect is very important to the survival of life on Earth. But the growing concentration of greenhouse gases from human activities is making this blanket thicker, and warming the planet, which has impacts on ecosystems and our way of life.', 'This absorption and radiation of heat by the atmosphere—the natural greenhouse effect—is beneficial for life on Earth.

Why do veterinarians clean the site of injection when administering euthansia?,"Veterinarians clean the site of injection when administering euthanasia to ensure that the euthanasia solution, which is usually a coloured solution like yellow, pink or blue, enters the vein and not the surrounding skin[4]. This is because the chemical in the Fatal Plus solution is irritating to the skin if given outside the vein[3]. The injection is not painful and if the pet has been sedated in advance, they are usually not aware of anything[1][4]. Flushing the line also ensures that all of the drug enters the patient[1].","['""Flushing the line just ensures all of the drug enters the patient,"" she said. ""We only use an IV catheter in patients with poor circulation. We feel that the animals are more comfortable with their owners and do not want to stress them by bringing them to the treatment area for catheter placement if not needed. The doctor instead gives them a quick shot in the rear, which most animals don\'t notice, and they slowly become heavily sedated or even lightly anesthetized. To the pet, this procedure should be very similar to other visits to the vet where they received vaccine injections or similar injections. The family is able to stay by the head of the patient and hug, pet and talk to them while the doctor uses a rear leg vein whenever possible to administer the euthanasia solution.""', 'Euthanasia is always performed by a licensed veterinarian. The procedure involves the veterinarian giving sedation intra-muscularly (in the muscle), placing an IV (intra-venous) catheter to establish a vein, and a lethal injection of a barbiturate anesthetic (sodium pentobarbitol), which, according to the AVMA has the ability to induce loss of consciousness and death without causing the pet any pain, distress, anxiety or apprehension. Sodium pentobarbitol is known to act rapidly and reliably. Sedation take about 5-10 minutes to take effect prior to the doctor administering the IV catheter. Our goal is to mimic your pet just going to sleep as much as possible. If you have any questions about the procedure, please do not hesitate to ask.', '""We will wait to give the euthanasia solution until the animal is either completely under anesthesia or barely responsive with sedation.

This is usually a coloured solution, such as yellow, pink or blue, so it is easily distinguishable. The pet will be given a concentrated overdose of the anaesthetic so that they peacefully fall asleep and then pass away. This usually happens quite quickly, often in less than a minute, and many owners are surprised by this. The injection is not painful. If your vet hasn’t already placed a cannula then there may be a short sharp scratch of the needle – the same as when we have blood taken ourselves at the hospital or have an intravenous injection. If your pet has been sedated in advance, then they are usually not aware of anything.', 'I sympathize with the fact that performing euthanasias must be the worst part of a veterinarian’s job, but with the volume of comments to this article, this horrific reaction to the sedative injection doesn’t seem to be the exception to the rule.']"
"Hypothetical: If a developed country was able to support all evolutionary mutations for millions of years, would things like asian people randomly be born from white people happen? Has genetic mutation stopped?","No, genetic mutation has not stopped. Even though genetic mutation occurs at a slow overall rate at the DNA level, some changes such as adaptations to climate have occurred relatively rapidly[1]. Migration between different groups is also responsible for genetic mixing, which can create new genetic combinations that can lead to evolutionary changes. However, the Bible teaches that, since the Curse of Adam, all of creation is in a downward slide, including the genetic information that is in every living cell, and this has likely caused an accumulation of genetic mistakes in the human gene pool that can result in genetic disorders in the offspring of close family members[4].","['Some noteworthy evolutionary changes in human beings have occurred relatively rapidly, despite the slow overall rate of change at the DNA level. The difference between the skin color of Africans and Europeans probably evolved in less than fifty thousand years, an adaptation to differences in climate. Still more rapid were changes in genes that confer resistance to malaria in Africa and Mediterranean regions; it only took between four and eight thousand years for the new genes to evolve. What genetic analysis reveals is that some of the genetic changes that seem so significant to us depended on a very tiny fraction of our DNA.', 'In five studies, evolutionary principles were offered to explain the results or to indicate that evolutionary explanations could not be ruled out. Elhassan et al.  described an episode of genetic drift to define the migration of a large east African population out of Africa based on mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit II (MT-CO2) sequence analysis and genome-wide microsatellite data. East Africans were shown to possess more ancestral lineages in comparison to various other continental populations, concluding that east Africa as the likely spot from which migration toward Asia took place, placing this population at the root of the human evolutionary tree.', '""An amazing discovery in genetics has shown that a certain plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) can actually fix a mutation in a recessive allele even when it doesn’t have a copy of the correct sequence in its genome. In a well-designed study, the mutation was shown to be corrected in a “templatedirected process,” not by random mutations. Organisms that have a better DNA correction system would have a survival advantage, but the irreducible complexity of the system makes it highly improbable that it evolved. This correction mechanism has never been seen before and seems to defy evolution by natural selection. How do you select for the ability to fix a mutation that you don’t have? This trait could easily be lost from the population by genetic drift or random mutation in organisms that lack the mutation (assuming it is a DNA-encoded trait). A system that fixes random mutations would stop, or at least slow down, the evolutionary process.', 'Evolution teaches that mutations have accumulated over millions of years to increase the complexity of organisms on the earth. The Bible teaches that, as a result of Adam’s sin, all of creation is in a downward slide—including the genetic information that is in every living cell. The law against marrying close relations was not given to Israel until Leviticus 18. Up to this point, the accumulation of genetic mistakes was apparently not significant enough to cause genetic disorders in the offspring of close family members. Today, with thousands of years of accumulated genetic mistakes in the human gene pool, intermarriage would be much more likely to produce children with genetic disorders. So it seems that the explanation of a genetic degradation since the Curse of Adam actually fits the evidence better than the evolution model of increasing complexity.', 'Biologists think of races of animals as groups that started as one, but later split and became separated, usually by a geographical barrier. As the two groups evolve independently, they gradually diverge genetically. The divergences will occur more quickly if the separate environments differ, but they will occur in any case since different mutations will inevitably occur in the two populations, and some of them will persist. This is most apparent in island populations, where each island is separate and there is no migration between them. Each one has its own characteristic types. In much of the animal world, however, and also in the human species, complete isolation is very rare. The genetic uniformity of geographical groups is constantly being destroyed by migration between them. In particular, the major geographical groups – African, European, and Asian – are mixed, and this is especially true in the United States, which is something of a melting pot.']"
Why is it that some things that make food taste so wonderful (like butter) are so terrible on their own?,"Butter has a unique flavour and texture that can enhance the taste of food, which is why it is often used as an ingredient. This is because real butter is made from grass-fed cows, which gives it its unique taste and texture. Also, depending on the breed of cow, the region, the season, and the animal or plant from which it comes, the flavour of butter can vary[4]. Therefore, it is important to store butter in an airtight container in order to keep its flavour true and unfettered[5].","['I spent over thirty years eating British butter. Then I moved to the States. And toast and sandwiches tasted wrong, baking was bland, even a brown butter sauce lacked punch. It took reading a (I think) Consumer Reports article, where they taste tested butters, to realise what I was missing. They both liked and disliked the Kerrygold because it reminded them of the artificial butter you get on popcorn. Which is a butter flavour formulated according to how good old fashioned butter tastes. Much like artificial banana tastes wrong because it was formulated from the now extinct Cavendish banana. As agricultural practices were replaced by industrial processes; tomatoes from a hothouse, apples picked before ripe, strawberries in winter, what actually gave these things their flavours is watered down. So much so that grass fed butter, a wild strawberry, a home grown tomato or an apple from your own tree is revelatory.', 'There is lots of great info and ideas here! I will be the first to say, we use butter for almost every meal we make. As long as its the real deal, it can really make a huge difference in the taste of the food, we have learned this the hard way, many times.', 'Butter is another fat that brings a lot of it’s own character to a dish. “While it’s carrying flavor, it’s imparting flavor as well,” says senior food editor Andy Baraghani. Just think of garlic and herb butter: while the aromatics and fresh greens are welcome members of the ensemble, we all know who we came here to see.', 'And second, that butter really does warrant the study of its terroir. While some may ask, “How bad can it be?” (fair question!), common threads emerged from the team’s tasting notes: cheesiness, texture, color, fattiness. These observations tie directly back to the cows: cheesiness and color from what the cows are fed, texture and fattiness from the type of cow, etc. And this is just the beginning: Butter tastes different when depending on the breed of the cow, the region, the season, and, obviously, the animal (or plant) from which it comes (goats! sheep! soy beans! yaks?).', 'Keep the flavor true and unfettered in the refrigerator by storing it in an airtight container. Butter can easily pick up odors from other foods that can change its taste, so doing whatever you can to seal those out is important.']"
Why is white flour so much more common in bread/baked goods/processed foods than whole wheat flour? Isn't the latter easier and cheaper to make?,"White flour is more common in bread/baked goods/processed foods than whole wheat flour because it is easier and cheaper to produce due to industrial milling processes that remove the bran and germ[2]. The removal of these parts of the grain also renders the flour more “purified” and less nutrient-dense, meaning that the FDA requires big flour companies to fortify certain white flours after the fact with additional nutrients and vitamins[2]. Furthermore, white flour is easier to use in baking due to its texture and lighter color, while whole wheat flour can be more difficult to work with. White whole wheat flour is an exception as it is ground from white wheat berries rather than red wheat berries, and is 100% whole wheat with “nothing added, nothing taken away”[4]. Whole-wheat flour provides a greater nutritional advantage than some white flours due to its higher vitamin content[5].","['Advocates in the whole-grain movement point to research that whole-grain flour is more nutritious than products made with white flour; that whole-grain foods are more filling and are easily digested by people with gluten sensitivities; that the flavor, the taste, the every little thing is better with non-commodity flour. But those arguments can sometimes sound incredulous — why do people choose to eat unhealthy white flour when they could eat whole grains? — pathologizing communities to whom ingredients like stone-ground local flour aren’t always accessible.', 'While we can celebrate the advancements of industry that made grinding and transporting wheat a consistent and predictable task, it has cost us: Ever more alienated from the ingredients that make up our food, roller-milled commodity white flour rendered farmers, millers, and bakers faceless and nameless. And that pure white flour frequently isn’t nourishing, either. The whiteness is a result of removing the bran and germ entirely — and with certain brands, often bleaching and bromating (a process of treating flour to improve elasticity and produce a higher rise in baked goods). Because commodity white flour is so “purified” by the industrial milling process, the FDA requires big flour companies to fortify certain white flours after the fact with additional nutrients and vitamins, even though grain when it’s milled whole is itself naturally nutrient-dense.', 'Using white flour for baked goods and whole for others is a great compromise! Especially if it makes preparing your own food easier on you (by skipping out on some of the hassles of traditional grain preparation).', 'White whole wheat flour is 100% whole wheat – “nothing added, nothing taken away,” as we like to say here. It’s ground from white wheat berries rather than red wheat berries; but just as a red tulip and a white tulip are both tulips, red and white wheat are both wheat.', 'Whole-wheat flour provides a nutritional advantage over some white flours due to its vitamin content. Whole-wheat flour contains several vitamins, including folate, riboflavin and vitamins B-1, B-3 and B-5. Some types of white flour contain lower levels of these vitamins, since the processing involved in making white flour destroys the grains’ vitamin content -- for example, 1/2 cup of whole-wheat flour contains 3 milligrams of niacin, while an equivalent portion of white flour contains only 0.8 milligrams.']"
"Why are things animals build (anthills, beehives) consitered 'natural', but things humans build (roads, houses) consitered unnatural?","The main reason why things animals build (anthills, beehives) are considered 'natural' but things humans build (roads, houses) are considered unnatural is because of the conceptual framework that underlies our notions of what is ‘natural’ and what is ‘manufactured’[1]. This framework states that ‘work’ properly so called is purposeful, deliberate, conscious activity, oriented toward some end or goal, and only humans can be said to ‘work’[2]. The environment that animals live in today is vastly different from the one they evolved with due to human intervention, such as added pesticides, pollution, contamination, urban sprawl, climate change, and introduced species that include pathogens, parasites, predators, and billions of humans[3][4]. This has caused a shift in the relationship between mankind and animals, with humans imposing their own linear, cubic thinking on animals, such as the boxes they build for bees[5].","['Such ambiguity underlines the tensions inherent in trying to categorise a nonhuman animal which exists in structured societies engaged in highly organised collective work dedicated to the production of something valued by humans. Other animals produce things of value to humans of course – cows produce milk, chicken lay eggs, but not through highly organised collective activity which lends itself so well to being categorised as ‘work’; and other animals produce things through highly organised activity – beavers build damns, birds make nests, spiders spin webs; but these products are not highly valued by human beings. Even more significantly, there are no other ‘livestock’ animals whose products we consume, but whose bodies we do not. For all these reasons, honeybees have no equals when it comes to exposing the fragility of the conceptual framework that underpins our notions of what is ‘natural’ and what is ‘manufactured’.', 'This is significant, because the activities of nonhuman animals are not often spoken of in these terms, as a form of work or labour. On the rare occasion that such terminology is used, it is usually meant purely as analogy, the intention being to compare certain animal behaviours with real – that is, human – labour, whilst taking it for granted that animals do not really ‘work’. The conceptual framework underpinning this is that ‘work’ properly so called is purposeful, deliberate, conscious activity, oriented toward some end or goal. It follows that only humans can be said to ‘work’, because – it is believed – animal activity is none of those things, but is merely instinctive behaviour. It might sometimes look like work, but to take this at face value is naive, because the animal does not really understand what it is doing.', 'The “nature” we provide our animals is not the nature they evolved with. We have added all the optional extras, including pesticides, pollution, contamination, urban sprawl, climate change, and introduced species that include pathogens, parasites, predators, and billions of humans. Seriously, how can nature take its course when there is no nature left?', 'My favorite: “The ‘nature’ we provide our animals is not the nature they evolved with.

We find it hard to think in curves. The move away from keeping bees in skeps has been ‘a move away from the principle of rounded forms to that of cuboid and square ones, and thus from the holistic and organic to the atomistic and additive. That is to say, the materialistic modes of thought that have been developing since the fifteenth century have also come to permeate the relationship between mankind and the bee.’2']"
"Jazz version: When Miles Davis (for example) made original compositions, how much of the music within each song (melodies, solos, etc) did he actually write? There are many amazing melodies found within a single song and I want to know how much he was directly responsible for creating.","Miles Davis was directly responsible for writing a lot of the music within each song. He wanted to move away from the standard jazz song structure and have each musician take a turn to solo within a limited number of chord changes[1]. He also sought improvisational freshness in the studio, and his first take philosophy helped make that happen on Kind of Blue[1][2]. His music was a mix of tradition and reinvention that bridged the post-Bop and free jazz eras, combining old and new[3]. He wanted musicians to realize that it was the feeling that counted, not perfection[1][2][4]. He was also an early pioneer in experimenting with composing in a way where musicians could improvise within a mode for extended periods, which inspired John Coltrane to further intensify this approach with his classic 1960s quartet[5].","['As Cannonball Adderely explained it, Miles was “tired of tunes.” In Bebop and into its successor, Hard Bop, the standard jazz song had musicians playing the song’s theme. Each musician then took a turn to solo, moving through a limited number of chord changes, before returning to the theme to wrap it up. Miles wanted more. “A solo is the way he thinks about the composition, and the solo became the thing,” said Adderley. “He thinks a solo can be a composition if it’s expressed the right way.” Davis’s first take philosophy helped make that happen on Kind of Blue. It wasn’t the first time.', 'The longer Davis performed “So What,” the less emotionally engaging it became. Although the basic song structure seemed to remain interesting to the musicians as a forum for experimentation and point of departure, repeat live performance was also a form of emotional dilution—if not the opposite of the improvisational freshness that Miles sought in studio, then at least a process that inhibited the profound, expressive moods of the originals. In other words, the first takes were the best takes. The later soloists are still improvising, just in a different way than when the song was in its infancy. They’re not exploring a new composition to see where they can take it melodically so much as testing the nature and meaning of jazz itself. As a listener, I find that less appealing.', 'As Hancock described the band, “[W]hen people were hearing us, they were hearing the avant-garde on the one hand, and they were hearing the history of jazz that led up [to] it on the other—because Miles was that history. He was that link.” So too with “So What.” The song bridged the post-Bop and free jazz eras, combining the mix of tradition and reinvention that defined those revolutionary times in jazz and American society. “So What” was effectively an artifact from Davis’s previous identity. He no longer played it how the band first composed it, because he was no longer the same person.', 'Reviewing Davis’s 1965 album E.S.P. for Down Beat magazine, trumpeter Kenny Dorham inadvertently articulated the problem: “I like to rate albums in the way that they move me emotionally as well as otherwise. Emotionally, as a whole, this one is lacking. It’s mostly brain music. . . .E.S.P. music, in general, is monotonous—one long drone. It’s not for me.” What Miles said in the Sketches of Spain liner notes applies as much to his approach to that album as it does to the inadequacies Dorham references. “It was hard to get the musicians to realize that they didn’t have to play perfect,” Davis wrote. “It was the feeling that counted.” Even though feeling clearly matter to Davis, later versions of “So What” contain so little of it. They’re mostly brain music.', 'Jazz musicians began to experiment with composing in this way in the late 1950s, inspired by theoretical work of George Russell. Miles Davis’s ‘Milestones’ (from the album of the same name) and ‘So What’ (from Kind of Blue) are key early examaples, where players improvise within a mode for extended periods; John Coltrane would intensify this approach with his classic 1960s quartet.']"

"Why are animals with bigger brains, like whales for example, not smarter than humans?","Brain size alone is not a good indicator of intelligence. This is because intelligence is more complex than just the size of the brain, and is influenced by a variety of factors, such as the structure and organization of the brain, the number of neurons, and the type and complexity of the neural pathways. Additionally, some animals, such as sea lions, have undergone strong natural selection on body size rather than brain size[3], meaning that their brains are relatively small compared to their body size. Furthermore, the relationship between brain size and intelligence is further complicated by the phenomenon of negative brain allometry, which states that as body size increases, the relative brain weight decreases[5]. This means that even though larger animals may have bigger brains, they may not necessarily be smarter than smaller animals.","['What’s more, humans, whales and dolphins all have spindle neurons in their brains. These nerve cells make us capable of deeper thought, such as reasoning skills, memory, communication and adaptive thinking.

Still, in proportion to our body size, the human brain is bigger than that of the sperm whale.', 'Within mammals, monkeys have much smaller brains than ungulates, and humans have much smaller brains than whales and elephants, while they are, without any doubt, more intelligent . However, there are groups like primates, where ‘bigger is better’ appears to hold.

The California sea lion, for example, famous for its circus-trick smarts, has an unusually small brain relative to its body mass. This is because when the evolutionary ancestors of seals and sea lions began living in water, evolution favoured massive increases in body size — perhaps to conserve body heat, to ward off predators such as sharks, or more generally because gravity is less of an impediment to large body size in water than in air.', 'For example, humans and dolphins not only have large brains overall, but also an astoundingly large neocortex, which is the powerhouse of mammal intelligence.', 'As a consequence of negative brain allometry, with increasing body weight, the relative brain weight decreases from more than 10% in very small mammals to less than 0.005% in the blue whale . The human brain again ranks relatively high with roughly 2% of body weight, but in close proximity to apes and dolphins. We thus conclude that relative brain size by itself is inappropriate for a correlation with intelligence. If this had any impact, then the tiniest animals should be the smartest ones, which apparently is not the case in any animal phylum, class or order. What we find, however, is more complicated: small animals with absolutely small brains can be surprisingly smart and large animals with absolutely large brains relatively unintelligent.']"
"Mod of /r/bleachshirts here, could you explain the chemical reaction that causes bleach to lighten colors and in higher concentrations eat through clothes?","Bleach works to remove color by oxidizing the chromophores, which are the chemical compounds that give clothes their color. During oxidation, the oxidizing agent (in this case sodium hypochlorite, NaClO) removes one or more electrons from the chromophore, resulting in a molecule that either does not contain a chromophore anymore or the chromophore is no longer able to absorb light in the visible range[3]. The reaction rate of the bleach can be increased by adding more of the reactants or by increasing the temperature[4]. Finally, bleach is used in laundry detergents to whiten clothes and remove most of the stains[5].","['Happy Friday, Mrs. Shoemaker’s 4th grade class! Did you know that when bleach ruins clothes, it\'s because of a chemical reaction? The oxygen molecules in bleach work to ""break up"" the chemical compounds (called chromophores) that give clothes their color! When the chromophores are broken or changed, our eyes see an absence of color on the parts of the clothes that the bleach touched, making them appear to be whitened from the bleach! :-)', 'To understand how bleach removes color, it is helpful to understand a bit about how colors work. Chemical compounds — called chromophores — cause colors by reflecting a certain portion of the visible spectrum of light. For example, a blue dress contains chromophores that reflect blue light that our eyes see as the color blue.', 'Most household bleaches are based on chlorine and contain sodium hypochlorite (NaClO). This is an oxidizing agent, which causes a reaction to form another chemical compound. During oxidation, the oxidizing agent removes one or more electrons from its reaction partner. This means that when bleach reacts with a ""stain molecule"" the oxidation reaction changes the chemical structure of the chromophore. The resulting molecule either does not contain a chromophore anymore or the chromophore is no longer able to absorb light in the visible range. In both cases the reaction product will not show a color, and the stain magically disappears. Want to see for yourself? Then do this activity and watch food coloring turn colorless!', 'One way of speeding up a chemical reaction is adding more of the reactants, which is why the blue and red colors disappear faster if you add more bleach to the solution. Another way of increasing the reaction rate is an increase in temperature. Once you heat up the blue food coloring solution, the color disappears much faster compared to a cold solution even if you add the same amount of bleach.', 'Have you ever wondered why your dirty clothes come out of the washing machine white and clean? What makes all the stains disappear? The answer to that question is bleach—an ingredient that is present in most laundry detergents. Bleach is responsible for the whitening effect that occurs during washing and removes most of the stains. But how does it work? In this science activity you will find out by making food coloring disappear with the power of bleach!']"
Why do so many pet a tiger lately? How is that possibly being safe?,"Many people are petting tigers lately, despite the risk involved. Tigers are wild, big cats that are top predators in their environment, and they can swim, climb, and jump[1]. They also pose an immediate danger to humans and have been responsible for over 50% of attacks on humans by large, non-domesticated wild cats[2]. Private owners often don't provide the proper veterinary care or know what tigers need to stay healthy[3], and attacks can occur even at accredited institutions[4]. Therefore, it is generally safer to leave tigers in their native habitats and opt for a domesticated pet instead[2][5].","['Further, it should not be left unsaid that tigers are dangerous animals. They are wild, big cats that are top predators in their environment. If you are considering keeping a wild tiger as a pet you must also consider the safety and security of yourself and the neighbors around you. Not only can tigers swim and climb, but they are accomplished jumpers too. This means that you must have every security measure in place in order to safely and securely keep your tiger enclosed and safe. Even the best, well funded, zoos in the world have had tigers escape from their enclosures, posing a risk to the tiger and the humans in the area. Just recently in 2007, a tiger escaped from San Francisco Zoo and killed a guest at the zoo.', 'Probably the biggest concern with keeping a tiger as a pet is the danger associated with enclosing a wild animal. Tigers are predatory animals and it is in their nature to hunt and seek out food. Tigers pose an immediate danger to humans and therefore should be left in the wild. When examining the number of attacks on humans committed by large cats kept as pets, the numbers are striking. Between 1990 and 2014 there were approximately 260 attacks on humans from large, non-domesticated wild cats. These 260 different attacks came from 16 different species of cat, however over 50% of the attacks came from tigers.', 'Most private owners don’t provide veterinary care, says Dr. Debbie Myers, director of veterinary medicine at Black Beauty Ranch, and some even subject their tigers to painful claw or tooth removals in a misguided and unsuccessful attempt to make them safer to handle. And most people don’t know what tigers need to stay healthy, such as parasite prevention. India arrived at the sanctuary with a host of parasites. He, along with Elsa and Loki, now receive routine preventative medication.', 'Statistics over the same time period show that most fatal attacks or injuries occurred at unaccredited facilities and private menageries. Attacks were also common at accredited institutions, coming from well-trained performing animals during a show or when taken for a walk in or near the public. Big cat safety issues in the United States have been sufficient to influence legislators around the country to create both state and federal laws banning the ownership of tigers.', 'Tigers are wild and beautiful creatures that are best left in their native habitats where they are free to explore and live a natural life. Maintaining a tiger as a pet is not only dangerous for humans, but can be disastrous for the overall health and happiness of the tiger. Luckily, there are some cat breed alternatives that can still give owners the feel of owning an exotic cat, with the ability to easily care for a domesticated pet.']"
Why does fish spoil so much faster than other types of meat?,"There are several reasons why fish spoils faster than other types of meat. One is that it contains more unsaturated fats, which turn rancid more readily than the saturated fats in beef[1]. Another is that fish have fewer structural components like collagen, which helps to maintain the structure of meat. Additionally, fish contain enzymes that digest fish, which can escape from the guts during rough handling and quickly go to work on its own flesh[4]. Finally, fish spoil faster than meats, and fatty fish from cold waters spoil the fastest[3].","['A third reason that fish flesh spoils faster than land meat is that it contains more unsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats turn rancid (oxidize) much more readily than the saturated fats in beef, for example.', ""Have you ever noticed that fish is spoiled quickly than land animal meat such as chicken, pork, and beef even under refrigerated conditions? Though fish and meat both are highly perishable, there are some compositional variations between them which triggers the spoilage of fish faster than meat. Let's look at them one by one."", 'So fish spoil faster than meats, and fatty fish from cold waters spoil the fastest. I was relieved: Fish scientists had already done the chill-and-sniff tests.', 'There’s another reason why fish spoils quickly. Most fish have the unfriendly habit of swallowing other fish whole, and they are therefore equipped with enzymes that digest fish. If any of these enzymes should escape from the guts by rough handling after a fish is caught, they’ll quickly go to work on its own flesh. That’s why fish should be gutted as soon as possible after being caught.', 'Also, fish contain less amount of collagen.(3%) compared to meat.(15%). This cause fish to become more softer which is susceptible to the mechanical damages during handling.']"

why don't people burn garbage instead of coal and other fossil fuels as a source of energy?,"Burning garbage instead of coal and other fossil fuels for energy is not a viable solution for several reasons.

Dogs have very sensitive smelling and hearing; so why does it appear that foul odours and loud sounds bother Humans more.,"Humans are more sensitive to loud sounds and foul odors because of the structure of their olfactory system, which is both quantitatively and qualitatively different to that of dogs[4]. Dogs have more olfactory receptor cells and a larger olfactory bulb, which allows for enhanced sensitivity of odor detection[4]. Additionally, medical conditions such as pain and cognitive dysfunction syndrome can make dogs more sensitive to loud sounds and foul odors[5]. Humans do not have the same enhanced sensitivity of odor detection as dogs, and may be more easily overwhelmed by loud sounds and foul odors[1].","['Then that made me think about odor. With dogs’ olfactory capabilities, how do they not get overwhelmed by the quantity and intensity of odors? Because it doesn’t seem like they do. My guess is along with their smelling sensitivity, they have different processing abilities as well. Some people experience sensory overload due to processing differences in their brains so it might make sense that it’s a processing difference that allows dogs to have such heightened abilities (compared to us) and still function in a world full of sights, sounds, and smells.', 'Although a number of publications and studies have confirmed the high applicability of the canine sense of smell in many fields, it must also be pointed out that all methods using dogs as detectors still have limitations, and reports of low efficiency, false positives, as well as false negatives, have unfortunately been taken as an indication of limited usefulness, overshadowing some quite spectacular achievements The key problem in using dogs for detection is that they are living animals, so there are a number of variables that can influence their performance, including their state of health (illness, pain) which can affect both their physical and mental condition (agitation, fearfulness, aggression), as well as mood, lifestyle, diurnal rhythm, stressful situations, traumatic experiences at work, psychophysical activity, rest, sleep, circadian rhythm, sexual cycle, and many more.', 'I can’t think of an instance where a sound or odour seemed to irritate my dogs. For example all three are sound asleep in the living room while there is someone using a power sander and a loud vacuum cleaner not far away. I want to flee from the house but they seem unconcerned. They do run from the vacuum but I think they are afraid of the machine moving around rather than the noise.', 'The sensitivity of canine olfaction is closely connected with the structure of their olfactory system, which is both quantitatively and qualitatively very different to that of humans (for example, dogs have more ORCs and a larger OB, allowing for enhanced sensitivity of odor detection) [99,100]. This is why it is difficult to predict exactly how dogs perceive their environment and how to adjust the techniques of human–dog cooperation to obtain the best results. Until humans have a full understanding of the potential of canine olfaction, the possibility remains that in using dogs’ sense of smell for work, the limits still lie in humans’ perception and learning, rather than in the dogs’ olfactory system.', 'Medical conditions such as pain (i.e., ear infection or arthritis) have been associated with noise sensitivity in dogs. Noise aversions presenting in senior dogs (7 to10 years of age) and geriatric dogs (those surpassing life expectancy) are more likely to be associated with medical conditions including pain, declining neurological function, sensory perception, endocrine imbalances, and/or cognitive dysfunction syndrome.']"
Why don't we duplicate organs?,"Duplicating organs is not currently possible, as cloning someone would only create a twin, not a replica[1].

Why do people cling to false information that has been widely and thoroughly debunked?,"People cling to false information that has been widely and thoroughly debunked for several reasons. One is that false information may continue to influence beliefs and attitudes even after being debunked if it is not replaced by an alternate causal explanation[2]. Another reason is that people tend to be more familiar with the information they remember, including lies, and thus may believe it is true[3][5].

Surprisingly, however, a detailed debunking message also correlated positively with the misinformation-persistence effect.”', 'Abstract: “Misinformation can be very difficult to correct and may have lasting effects even after it is discredited. One reason for this persistence is the manner in which people make causal inferences based on available information about a given event or outcome. As a result, false information may continue to influence beliefs and attitudes even after being debunked if it is not replaced by an alternate causal explanation. We test this hypothesis using an experimental paradigm adapted from the psychology literature on the continued influence effect and find that a causal explanation for an unexplained event is significantly more effective than a denial even when the denial is backed by unusually strong evidence.

What determines the maximum PSI rating on bicycle tires of identical diameter/why does this seem to vary mostly with tire volume?,"The maximum PSI rating on bicycle tires of identical diameter is determined by the tire volume. The wider the tire, the more air volume it has, meaning it needs less air pressure to prevent it from bottoming out on the rim[3]. Narrower tires have less air volume and require more air pressure to prevent bottoming out[3]. The PSI rating is usually stamped onto the sidewall of the tire, and can vary depending on the type of tire; mountain bike tires are usually rated for 25-50 PSI, road tires for 80-120 PSI, and gravel tires for 40-80 PSI.","['The inflation pressure of bicycle tires ranges from 4.5 psi (0.31 bar; 31 kPa) for fat bike tires in snow to 220 psi (15 bar; 1.5 MPa) for tubular track racing tires. The maximum pressure rating of tires is usually stamped on the sidewall, indicated as ""Maximum Pressure"", or ""Inflate to ..."" or sometimes expressed as a range like ""5–7 bar (73–102 psi; 500–700 kPa)"". Decreasing pressure tends to increase traction and make the ride more comfortable while increasing pressure tends to make the ride more efficient and decreases the chances of getting pinch flats.', 'That said, 120 psi for a road bike tyre is considered excessive these days, it should be tailored to your weight and 100 psi is a bit of a ceiling for optimal rolling resistance (fashion alert). So its certainly no big deal if you only hit 115 psi, but I would be sceptical of the pump getting close to its maximum rating. I imagine your portable hand pump is rated 100+ psi and probably hard work to get even close, hence looking for an alternative.', 'All tires require a certain amount of air pressure to prevent them from bottoming out on the rim. Wider tires have more air volume. This makes it possible to ride them at lower pressures for more comfort and traction. Conversely, a narrower tire, like a 28mm road tire has comparatively much less volume so it needs more air pressure to prevent bottoming out. If you have a 2.5” enduro tire on your mountain bike, you’ll be able to ride at pressures close to 20 PSI. Rolling out on the road bike with 28mm slicks? Anything less than 80 PSI would be risky.', 'So where do you begin if you’re new to cycling and just got a road, mountain, gravel, or cyclocross bike?

Does my cat or dog hear the music I'm playing all day?,"Studies have shown that cats may not respond to music in the same way as humans do, as their hearing spectrum is different and their brains are more tuned to different frequencies[1]. While cats may not appreciate human music, they may be able to enjoy species-specific music[5]. If you want to try playing music for your cat, it is best to observe them while they are awake and not distracted[2].

How come pet life expectancy hasn’t increased alongside human life expectancy?,"Pet life expectancy has increased in the past few decades, largely due to better health care and better diet[1]. However, pet life expectancy has not increased as much as human life expectancy, likely because they are exposed to the same pollutants and carcinogens as humans and more than half of U.S. pets are overweight or obese[1]. Additionally, factors such as regular physical activity, social connectedness, and the human-animal bond can positively influence the emotional, psychological, and physical health and wellbeing of people, but the same factors may not have the same effect on pets[2]. Scientists believe that other factors, such as the size of the pet, may play a role in life expectancy. Furthermore, human life expectancy did not keep rising after it reached 30 years 30,000 years ago[5], so pet life expectancy may also have plateaued.","['Despite the differences between cats and dogs, both pets are living longer than ever before. Dog life expectancy has doubled in the past 4 decades, and housecats now live twice as long as their feral counterparts. The reasons can largely be chalked up to better health care and better diet. Americans will spend $60 billion on their pets this year, with a large chunk of that going to humanlike health care (think annual physicals and open-heart surgery) and premium food. ""The same things that allow us to live longer also apply to our pets,"" says João Pedro de Magalhães, a biogerontologist at the University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom who maintains AnAge, the world\'s largest database of animal life spans.

Why is it that the world is refusing to fully convert to renewable energy sources?,"There are several reasons why the world is refusing to fully convert to renewable energy sources. One is that there is a lack of awareness of the benefits of renewable energy, and disruption of seascape and land acquisition which could have been used for other activities[1]. Another reason is that the world's population is growing and the current demand is being met through the use of fossil fuels[2]. There are also numerous barriers that prevent renewable energy from effectively competing with traditional energy and hamper achievement of the necessary large-scale deployment[3]. Additionally, renewable sources tend to under-deliver during certain periods[5]. Lastly, renewable electricity would radically reduce overall energy intensity, but economies running on renewable electricity will consume less energy due to waste reduction[4].","['The transition from conventional resources to renewable energy has encountered public resistance and opposition. This is due to a lack of awareness of the benefits of renewable energy, disruption of seascape, and acquisition of land which could have been used for agriculture, tourism, etc. (Goldsmiths, 2015).', ""The world's population is growing at an unprecedented rate and that has necessitated a dramatic increase in energy demand globally. Matching supply with this surging demand is a principal and critical challenge for countries around the world. Currently, this demand is being met through the increased use of fossil fuels. The majority of the world's power is generated from the use of coal, oil and gas. These so-called fossil fuels, when burned, release heat energy which is then converted into electricity releasing into the atmosphere a lot of carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas that contributes to the issue of global warming. A renewable energy supply offers a solution to both challenges. For economic growth and human advancement, energy has always been universally considered one of the most crucial measures (Rawat and Sauni, 2015). There is a three-dimensional relationship alongside a bi-directional causal relationship between economy, the environment and energy (Azad et al., 2014)."", 'Despite remarkable promotion and commitment from various nations, only a small percentage of energy is generated from renewable energy, especially in developing countries. This scenario is because of the numerous barriers that control the diffusion of renewable energy. These barriers prevent renewable energy from effectively competing with traditional energy and hamper achievement of the necessary large-scale deployment (Nasirov et al., 2015). Penetration and scale-up of renewable require a strong political and regulatory framework which supports and promotes a continued focus on fossil fuels (Karatayev et al., 2016).', 'In short, economies running on renewable electricity will consume less energy because they will waste less energy. They might not consume two-thirds less — waste will never reach zero, and there will be some rebound effect that comes with greater efficiency — but they certainly won’t need to replace the full 80 percent fossil fuels is providing now. And renewable electricity will radically reduce overall energy intensity, even if all it does is substitute for current energy uses.', ""Renewable energy sources tend to under-deliver during certain periods — such as for instance in the month of September, when there's less wind power generated in Europe and China, according to Boyle of S&P Global Platts.""]"

Why is beef so fatty when a cow's diet is mostly grass?,"Beef can be fatty even when a cow's diet is mostly grass because the cows may produce cortisol when they are stressed, which leads to fattier meat[1].

"Why do most animals get intimidated by size, across many species? Do animals understand the concept of size correlating with a threat? Why?","Animals understand the concept of size correlating with a threat as a survival instinct, as size usually indicates strength and dominance. Large size can be intimidating and can be used as a way to compete for resources or to attempt a takeover of a group. Animals likely understand this concept through their complex mental capacities, such as the ability to give objects names and use tools[3]. They also show emotions such as fear, which could be seen as instinctual[3][4]. Additionally, animals use tactics such as violence, threats, and harassment to gain dominance, which has been compared to sexual assault among humans[5].","['Female resistance has rarely been found to be effective. Male mammals and birds are usually larger than females, and the sheer size and strength difference makes this very difficult. However, it has been observed in some species, such as squirrel monkeys, patas monkeys, vervets, and captive chimpanzees, that females can “gang up” on males when they are being aggressive. They will even try to protect a female in distress. Females have even been observed to kill immigrant males in wild red colobus monkeys.', 'Competition for resources may not be the only factor producing a negative relationship between group size and female reproductive performance. For example, in some species, such as langurs and lions, large groups of females are attractive targets for takeover attempts by males. If male takeovers are associated with infanticide, as is the case in a number of mammalian species (van Schaik & Janson 2000), then rates of infant mortality may be higher in large groups than in small ones.', 'Nevertheless, most scientists now feel they can say with confidence that some animals process information and express emotions in ways that are accompanied by conscious mental experience. They agree that animals, from rats and mice to parrots and humpback whales, have complex mental capacities; that a few species have attributes once thought to be unique to people, such as the ability to give objects names and use tools; and that a handful of animals—primates, corvids (the crow family) and cetaceans (whales and dolphins)—have something close to what in humans is seen as culture, in that they develop distinctive ways of doing things which are passed down by imitation and example. No animals have all the attributes of human minds; but almost all the attributes of human minds are found in some animal or other.', 'Animals obviously show emotions such as fear. But this can be taken to be instinctual, similar to what happens when people cry out in pain. Behaviourists had no trouble with fear, seeing it as a conditioned reflex that they knew full well how to create. The real question is whether animals have feelings which involve some sort of mental experience. This is not easy. No one knows precisely what other people mean when they talk about their emotions; knowing what dumb beasts mean is almost impossible. That said, there are some revealing indications—most notably, evidence for what could be seen as compassion.', 'Sexual coercion among animals is the use of violence, threats, harassment, and other tactics to help them forcefully copulate.

One of the best things about the diet is that there are plenty of food options and lots of wiggle room, so you can pick and choose the foods you like best.', 'Just as there are pro-inflammatory foods, we can protect against inflammation by eating anti-inflammatory foods. These foods contain antioxidants and polyphenols, which are protective compounds. Free radicals are harmful to antioxidants and cells and protect against free-radical damage by donating an extra electron to the free radical to create molecular stability. Plant-based foods tend to be high in polyphenols, which are packed with antioxidants.', 'What does an anti-inflammatory diet do? Your immune system becomes activated when your body recognizes anything that is foreign—such as an invading microbe, plant pollen, or chemical. This often triggers a process called inflammation. Intermittent bouts of inflammation directed at truly threatening invaders protect your health.', 'One of the most powerful tools to combat inflammation comes not from the pharmacy, but from the grocery store. ""Many experimental studies have shown that components of foods or beverages may have anti-inflammatory effects,"" says Dr. Frank Hu, professor of nutrition and epidemiology in the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health.', 'In this Harvard Medical School Guide you’ll be introduced to foods—more than 120 in all—that will help you turn out meals that fight inflammation and disease. You’ll learn how plant-based chemicals called phytochemicals act as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents, helping to bring down levels of inflammation and to counteract inflammation’s harmful effects. And you’ll find dozens of anti-inflammatory foods with added health benefits that include lowering cholesterol, reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and of stroke, improving blood pressure, adding protection against heart disease, and even reducing pain and soreness after exercise.']"
"Why have humans adapted to like sweet or salty things better than bitter, sour, etc. things?","Humans have adapted to like sweet or salty things better than bitter, sour, etc. things because it is hypothesized that this predisposition evolved to attract children to energy-dense foods while discouraging the consumption of toxins[1]. Sweet tastes are preferred by newborns and bitter tastes are disliked by infants[1]. This is because humans have genes that allow us to sense sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami (i.e., savory) flavors, which helps us to determine if foods are safe or harmful to eat[5]. Additionally, creatures crave sweet for sugar and calories, a yen for umami keeps many animals nourished with protein, and salt is essential for bodies to stay in fluid balance[2]. Sour sensing appears to have staying power that its cousins do not[3], which means that it must be doing something important, perhaps something ancient[3]. Finally, research has revealed that evolutionary changes at a genetic level are responsible for diverse tastes in animals[5].","['Taste preferences in humans are influenced by different factors including genetics, culture, repeated exposures and role models such as parents and siblings, and taste preferences change over time. Sweet tastes are preferred by newborns and bitter tastes are disliked by infants. In general humans are born with a biological predisposition to prefer sweet and to avoid bitter foods such as green leafy vegetables. It has been hypothesized that this predisposition evolved to attract children to energy-dense foods while discouraging the consumption of toxins. There are at least 25 known genes in the bitter taste receptor family in humans. “Sweet” perception involves at least 3 genes, and others have been identified for sour and salty foods.', 'When researchers consider the classic five categories of taste—sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami—there’s little disagreement over which of them is the least understood. Creatures crave sweet for sugar and calories. A yen for umami, or savoriness, keeps many animals nourished with protein. Salt’s essential for bodies to stay in fluid balance, and for nerve cells to signal. And a sensitivity to bitterness can come in handy with the whole not-poisoning-yourself thing.', 'And yet we taste sour, strongly, and are not alone in doing so. When Dunn and his colleagues recently set out to investigate the sensation’s evolutionary roots, he told me, they couldn’t find a single backboned species that had definitively lost the ability to identify acidic foods, be they birds or mammals or amphibians or reptiles or fish. Admittedly, that may be a function of how few animals scientists have surveyed—just several dozen—but already, that makes sour a standout. Cats, otters, hyenas, and other carnivores have lost the ability to suss out sugar; giant pandas are immune to umami; dolphins, which swallow their prey whole, don’t seem to be able to savor sweetness or savoriness, and have booted bitter sensitivity too. But sour sensing appears to have staying power that its cousins do not—which means that it must be doing something important, perhaps something ancient.', 'Humans can detect sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and savory tastes. This allows us to determine if foods are safe or harmful to eat.', 'Most of us get in line at the ice cream shop or tear into a piece of chocolate cake without giving much thought to why we like what we do. Humans appreciate a wide variety of tastes because of our omnivorous evolutionary history and the genes we carry that allow us to sense sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami (i.e., savory) flavors. But the same isn’t true of all animals. Most cats, for example, dubiously sniff at sweets. This is because, over the course of its evolutionary history, the feline lineage lost a functional gene to detect sweet flavors. Birds also lack this gene and, usually, the sweet tooth that comes with it — but there are a few notable exceptions. Hummingbirds, for example, make a proverbial beeline for honey-sweet liquids. Why are hummingbirds sugar junkies, while robins stick with worms? New research reveals at a genetic level the evolutionary changes that account for such diverse tastes.']"
Can I replace all meat that I eat with tofu (let's say 24g of protein every few days) and still be healthy?,"Yes, it is possible to replace all meat that you eat with tofu and still be healthy. Tofu is a low-carb and low fat food and its high protein content allows you to repair muscles after exercise[2]. Additionally, the quantity and quality of amino acids in tofu should be the same as that in meat[3]. Furthermore, tofu is full of protein and it is a healthy and complex protein[4][5]. As long as you spend time researching alternative sources for nutrients found in animal products, you should be able to maintain a healthy diet[5].","[""ELI5: Can I replace all meat that I eat with tofu (let's say 24g of protein every few days) and still be healthy?"", ""You can still classify tofu as low-carb and low fat. Substituting meat for tofu can easily result in a loss of fat and calories in your diet. Additionally, tofu's high protein content allows you to repair muscles after exercise, rather than having them broken down to be used for fuel."", 'While there may be some variation in the nutrient content of fresh versus packaged tofu—omega-3 fatty acids, for instance, can degrade with exposure to light and air—the quantity and quality of amino acids should be the same. Using soy products as a source of protein lets you reduce your intake of meat, which may well confer a net health benefit—especially if the meat being replaced is high in saturated fat.', ""Tofu has become a rising star in the meat substitute world, especially because it is full of protein. 3oz of tofu is comprised of about 18% protein while skinless roast chicken comes in at approximately 46%. But that doesn’t mean it's any less healthy! Tofu and chicken protein isn’t the only nutritional value to take into consideration."", 'ELI5 said I need to elaborate on my answer so here we go. Most people get much more than enough protein that they need. Tofu is a healthy and complex protein. As long as you spend like 10 minutes researching alternative sources for nutrients found in animal products you should be find. Also the dietetic community unanimously says that vegan/vegetarian diets can be healthy. Good luck!']"
