This bill authorizes the Department of Transportation (DOT) to provide technical assistance grants to states and local governments to (1) develop more state and local value capture mechanisms for long-term funding that promote mobility, public transportation, and affordable transit-oriented development; (2) improve public transportation and mobility; and (3) develop strategic partnerships that create greater self-help capacity that leads to greater long term and robust investments in public transportation, mobility, inclusive economic development, and affordable transit-oriented development.
DOT must","To amend title 49, United States Code, to provide grants and develop 
                         value capture policy.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Incentivizing Value Capture for 
Greener Transportation Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 2018, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) rose sharply by 
        3.4 percent, the second-largest annual gain in more than 20 
        years, and GHG emissions have grown by approximately 1.5 
        percent every year over the last decade.
            (2) Greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation 
        sector, including cars and trucks, are the largest source of 
        GHG emissions in the United States with the transportation 
        sector emitting 1,900,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) 
        annually.
            (3) Annual vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the United 
        States have nearly tripled since 1971, rising to 
        3,210,000,000,000 in 2018.
            (4) Consequently, in 2018, Americans lost an average of 97 
        hours a year due to congestion, costing them nearly 
        $87,000,000,000.
            (5) Residents in communities located near high-capacity 
        transit are twice as likely not to own a car as residents who 
        live elsewhere, and they own half as many cars per household.
            (6) Increasing transit ridership and improving our transit 
        systems in urban, suburban, and exurban areas, using innovative 
        solutions such as land value capture, will help reduce VMT, 
        congestion, GHG emissions, and reliance on fossil fuels and 
        vehicles. By reducing such factors, the United States can help 
        curb the effects of climate change.

SEC. 3. VALUE CAPTURE POLICY AND PLANNING PROGRAM.

    Chapter 53 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding at 
the end the following:

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Wild Horse and Burro Protection Act 
of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) As part of efforts to control equine populations under 
        law, the Bureau of Land Management is directed to humanely 
        capture wild free-roaming horses and burros for adoption.
            (2) The Bureau of Land Management contracts directly with 
        private enterprises, including helicopter companies, to round 
        up equines at rates between $500-$800 per animal.
            (3) The use of helicopters to chase equines over prolonged 
        distances, usually on rough terrain, is particularly dangerous, 
        and can frighten the animals and lead to deadly situations.
            (4) In January 2022, during the horse gathering at the 
        Pancake Complex in central Nevada, a young colt was chased for 
        miles by helicopter, ultimately gravely injuring itself, and 
        necessitating the need for the animal to be shot and killed.
            (5) Since 2011, the Bureau of Land Management's top three 
        helicopter contractors have collected over $36.8 million in 
        taxpayer funding for their services, including over $5.3 
        million since 2021 alone.
            (6) Scientific research shows that more humane and cost-
        effective alternatives exist to control equine populations, 
        including fertility controls.
            (7) Currently, the Bureau of Land Management's Wild Horse

This bill prohibits the preparing, placing, installing, setting, deploying, or otherwise using an M-44 device on public land. An M-44 device is defined as a device designed to propel sodium cyanide when triggered by an animal, including any device that may be commonly known as an M-44 ejector device or an M-44 predator control device.
No later than 30 days after the enactment of this bill, any federal, state, or county agency that has prepared, placed, installed, set, or deployed an M-44 device on public land shall remove each such device from such land.","To prohibit the use of M-44 devices, commonly known as ``cyanide 
            bombs'', on public land, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as ``Canyon's Law''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Sodium cyanide is the highly toxic pesticide active 
        ingredient used in M-44 devices, also known as ``cyanide 
        bombs'', and is used to kill wolves, coyotes, foxes, and wild 
        dogs suspected of preying on livestock and poultry.
            (2) Sodium cyanide is registered for restricted use under 
        the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 
        U.S.C. 136 et seq.) as a Category One acute toxicant, the most 
        hazardous Environmental Protection Agency classification 
        available, due to the harm it poses to people and the 
        environment.
            (3) Poisoning by sodium cyanide leads to central nervous 
        system depression, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, 
        paralysis, and blindness.
            (4) The Environmental Protection Agency authorizes the use 
        of M-44 devices nationwide, and in recent years, M-44s were 
        used in Colorado, Idaho, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, 
        Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and 
        Wyoming.
            (5) In 2017, an M-44 device exposed an Idaho child to a 
        sublethal dose of sodium cyanide with subsequent short-term and 
        long-term medical complications. Two Wyoming children were also 
        exposed to the poison from another M-44 device. Three family 
        dogs died in these two separate incidents.
            (6) The indiscriminate M-44 device commonly harms nontarget 
        wildlife and people; at least 42 people have accidentally 
        triggered a cyanide bomb causing exposure to cyanide gas and 
        injuries since 1984.
            (7) M-44 devices kill targeted animals only 53 percent of 
        the time. Thousands of nontarget species of animals have been 
        killed by M-44s, including bald eagles, golden eagles, gray 
        wolves, black bears, grizzly bears, bobcats, fishers, and 
        family dogs.
            (8) Despite the United States Fish and Wildlife Service 
        determining in 1993 that M-44 devices could kill endangered 
        species like the California Condor, the use of the M-44 
        continues in areas where endangered species are found and 
        continues to result in the deaths of endangered species.

SEC. 3. USE OF M-44 DEVICES ON PUBLIC LAND PROHIBITED.

    (a) In General.--Preparing, placing, installing, setting, 
deploying, or otherwise using an M-44 device on public land is 
prohibited.
    (b) Removal.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, any Federal, State, or county agency that has 
prepared, placed, installed, set, or deployed an M-44 device on public 
land shall remove each such M-44 device from public land.

                recommendations for implementing the closure of 
                wildlife markets and prevention of the commercial trade 
                in live wildlife for human consumption, except where 
                the consumption of wildlife is necessary for local food 
                security or where such actions would significantly 
                disrupt a readily available and irreplaceable food 
                supply;
                    (B) raise awareness and build stakeholder 
                engagement networks, including civil society, the 
                private sector, and local and regional governments on 
                the dangerous potential of wildlife markets as a source 
                of zoonotic diseases and reduce demand for the 
                consumption of wildlife through evidence-based behavior 
                change programs, while ensuring that existing wildlife 
                habitat is not encroached upon or destroyed as part of

                sustainable food production, farming, and shifts to 
                sustainable sources of protein and nutrition instead of 
                terrestrial wildlife, where able and appropriate, and 
                reduce consumer demand for terrestrial and freshwater 
                wildlife through enhanced local and national food 
                systems, especially in areas where wildlife markets 
                play a significant role in meeting subsistence needs 
                while ensuring that existing wildlife habitat is not 
                encroached upon or destroyed as part of this process;

interventions will need to be tailored to the situation to--
            (1) pursuant to section 3, close wildlife markets and 
        prevent associated commercial trade in live wildlife, placing a 
        priority focus on countries with significant markets for live 
        wildlife for human consumption, high-volume commercial trade 
        and associated markets, trade in and across urban centers, and 
        trade for luxury consumption or where there is no dietary 
        necessity--
                    (A) through existing treaties, conventions, and 
                agreements;
                    (B) by amending existing protocols or agreements;

                destruction, degradation, fragmentation, or conversion 
                of intact forests and other intact ecosystems and 
                biodiversity strongholds, including by governments, 
                private sector entities, and multilateral development 
                financial institutions;
            (8) offer appropriate alternative livelihood and worker 
        training programs and enterprise development to wildlife 
        traders, wildlife breeders, and local communities whose members 
        are engaged in the commercial trade in live wildlife for human 
        consumption;
            (9) ensure that the rights of indigenous peoples and local 
        communities are respected and their authority to exercise these

                subsection, the term ``mirror code tax system'' means,

                1324(b)(2) of title 31, United States Code, the

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Alternatives to Animals for 
Regulatory Fairness Act of 2021'' or the ``AARF Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) the Food and Drug Administration (in this section 
        referred to as the ``FDA'') often requires pharmaceutical 
        companies to conduct or commission testing on dogs and other 
        animals to assess the safety or effectiveness of new drugs, 
        even though such testing is inefficient, expensive, and 
        ineffective;
            (2) the National Institutes of Health states, 
        ``Approximately 30 percent of promising medications have failed 
        in human clinical trials because they are found to be toxic 
        despite promising preclinical studies in animal models. About 
        60 percent of candidate drugs fail due to lack of efficacy'';
            (3) current FDA nonbinding pharmaceutical testing 
        guidelines support the use of alternatives to animal testing to 
        improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug development;
            (4) current FDA drug testing guidance for the 
        pharmaceutical industry states, ``consideration should be given 
        to use of new in vitro alternative methods for safety 
        evaluation'';
            (5) the FDA's drug testing guidance for industry 
        additionally states, ``alternative approaches . . . can also be 
        used . . . . The use of any of these approaches can reduce 
        overall animal use in drug development'';
            (6) the FDA writes that alternatives to animal testing, 
        ``may help bring FDA-regulated products to market faster, with 
        improved efficacy, or prevent products with increased 
        toxicological risk from reaching the market. Also critical is 
        the potential for these advances to replace, reduce, and/or 
        refine animal testing'';
            (7) pharmaceutical companies are reducing animal testing by 
        investing in the development and use of alternative methods, 
        which studies show are often more effective and efficient than 
        traditional animal use;
            (8) the FDA states, ``FDA encourages sponsors to consult 
        with us if they wish to use a non-animal testing method they 
        believe is suitable, adequate, validated, and feasible''; and
            (9) in some cases, drug manufacturers and sponsors have not 
        been allowed by the FDA to use alternatives to animal testing 
        to fulfill regulatory requirements, despite the FDA's support 
        for this technology in its industry guidance document.

SEC. 3. ALTERNATIVES TO ANIMAL TESTS.

    Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 
355) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(z) Alternatives to Animal Tests.--The Secretary shall allow the 
sponsor of a drug to use a non-animal test as an alternative to an 
animal test for purposes of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness 
of a drug under this section if such approach satisfies the 
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.''.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``FEMA Climate Change Preparedness 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Under the previous Administration, the term ``climate 
        change'' was intentionally stripped from the Agency's 2018-2022 
        Strategic Plan, despite the mounting threat posed by climate 
        change as a source of changing and increasing national disaster 
        risks.
            (2) It is the general consensus of the global scientific 
        community that--
                    (A) the evidence of climate change is unequivocal;
                    (B) anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the 
                primary cause of climate change; and
                    (C) as a direct result of climate change, sea 
                levels are rising and extreme weather events are 
                becoming more commonplace and severe.
            (3) The last 7 years have been the warmest years on record 
        since the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration began 
        recording global air temperatures in 1895.
            (4) In 2020, there were a record total of 22 climate 
        disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each to affect 
        the United States--amounting to 5 more disasters of such 
        magnitude than each of the previous record years of 2011 and 
        2017.
            (5) It is the mission of FEMA to reduce the loss of life 
        and property and protect our institutions from all hazards by 
        leading and supporting the Nation in a comprehensive, risk-
        based emergency management program of mitigation, preparedness, 
        response, and recovery.
            (6) It is detrimental to the mission of FEMA, and the 
        Agency's ability to follow its mandate, to explicitly or 
        implicitly deny or ignore the existence of climate change or 
        the implications of such on national security and national 
        emergency management.
            (7) To fully and effectively carry out its mandate, FEMA 
        must comprehensively assess and incorporate the current and 
        future natural disaster risks and impacts posed by climate 
        change throughout the Agency's policies, plans, programs, 
        strategies, and operations.

                    ``(A) changing, more frequent, and more severe 
                extreme weather events;
                    ``(B) rising natural hazard risk;
                    ``(C) disruptions to or failure of critical 
                infrastructure;
                    ``(D) sea-level rise;
                    ``(E) internal population displacement;
                    ``(F) the spread of life-threatening diseases;
                    ``(G) rising annual disaster costs; and
                    ``(H) disproportionately high risks and impacts to 
                low-income communities, communities of color, Tribal 
                communities, and other frontline communities.''.

SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``ESG Disclosure Simplification Act 
of 2021''.

SEC. 102. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Securities and Exchange Commission has broad 
        authority to require the disclosure of information if such 
        information is in the interest of, or is material to investors.
            (2) The Commission does not require companies to disclose 
        information related to environmental, social, and governance 
        (``ESG'') matters, and does not require companies to adhere to 
        standards for disclosing such information.
            (3) Investors have reported that voluntary disclosures of 
        ESG metrics are inadequate.
            (4) A rule requiring reporting and standardization of ESG 
        disclosures is in the interest of investors.
            (5) ESG matters are material to investors, and the 
        Commission must establish standards for disclosure of such 
        matters.

SEC. 103. ESG DISCLOSURES.

    (a) In General.--Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(15 U.S.C. 78n) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(k) ESG Disclosures.--
            ``(1) In general.--Each issuer the securities of which are 
        registered under section 12 or that is required to file annual 
        reports under section 15(d) shall disclose in any proxy or 
        consent solicitation material for an annual meeting of the 
        shareholders--
                    ``(A) a clear description of the views of the 
                issuer about the link between ESG metrics and the long-
                term business strategy of the issuer; and
                    ``(B) a description of any process the issuer uses 
                to determine the impact of ESG metrics on the long-term 
                business strategy of the issuer.
            ``(2) ESG metrics defined.--In this subsection, the term 
        `ESG metrics' has the meaning given the term in part 210 of 
        title 17, Code of Federal Regulations as amended pursuant to 
        section 3(b) of the ESG Disclosure Simplification Act of 
        2021.''.
    (b) Rulemaking.--
            (1) In general.--The Securities and Exchange Commission (in 
        this Act referred to as the ``Commission'') shall amend part 
        210 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor 
        thereto) to--
                    (A) require each issuer, in any filing of the 
                issuer described in such part that requires audited 
                financial statements, to disclose environmental, 
                social, and governance metrics (in this title referred 
                to as ESG metrics); and
                    (B) define ESG metrics.
            (2) Sustainable finance advisory committee.--The 
        Sustainable Finance Advisory Committee established pursuant to 
        section 4(k) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 shall, 
        not later than 180 days after the date of the first meeting of 
        such Committee, submit to the Commission recommendations about 
        what ESG metrics the Commission should require issuers to 
        disclose.
            (3) Materiality.--It is the sense of Congress that ESG 
        metrics, as such term is defined by the Commission pursuant to 
        paragraph (1), are de facto material for the purposes of 
        disclosures under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the 
        Securities Act of 1933.
            (4) Incorporation of international standards.--When 
        amending part 210 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations (or 
        any successor thereto) pursuant to paragraph (1), the 
        Commission may, as the Commission determines appropriate, 
        incorporate any internationally recognized, independent, multi-
        stakeholder environmental, social, and governance disclosure 
        standards.
            (5) Location of disclosure.--Any disclosure required by 
        paragraph (1) may be included in a notes section of the filing.
            (6) Delay for small issuers.--The Commission may use a 
        phased approach when applying any amendments made pursuant to 
        paragraph (1) to small issuers and may determine the criteria 
        by which an issuer qualifies as a small issuer for purposes of 
        such phased approach.

        obligated to conduct business for the best interests of their 
        owners, the shareholders;
            (4) historically, shareholders have not had a way to know, 
        or to influence, the political activities of corporations they 
        own;

        corporate managers are spending company funds to make political 
        contributions and expenditures benefitting candidates, 
        political parties, and political causes; and
            (6) corporations should be accountable to shareholders in 
        making political contributions or expenditures affecting 
        Federal governance and public policy.

SEC. 402. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) climate change poses a significant and increasing 
        threat to the growth and stability of the economy of the United 
        States;
            (2) many sectors of the economy of the United States and 
        many American businesses are exposed to climate-related risk, 
        which may include exposure to--
                    (A) the physical impacts of climate change, 
                including the rise of the average global temperature, 
                accelerating sea-level rise, desertification, ocean 
                acidification, intensification of storms, increase in 
                heavy precipitation, more frequent and intense 
                temperature extremes, more severe droughts, and longer 
                wildfire seasons;
                    (B) the economic disruptions and security threats 
                that result from the physical impacts described in 
                subparagraph (A) including conflicts over scarce 
                resources, conditions conducive to violent extremism, 
                the spread of infectious diseases, and forced 
                migration;
                    (C) the transition impacts that result as the 
                global economy transitions to a clean and renewable 
                energy, low-emissions economy, including financial 
                impacts as climate change fossil fuel assets becoming 
                stranded and it becomes uneconomic for companies to 
                develop fossil fuel assets as policymakers act to limit 
                the worst impacts of climate change by keeping the rise 
                in average global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius 
                above pre-industrial levels; and
                    (D) actions by Federal, State, Tribal, territorial, 
                and local governments to limit the worst effects of 
                climate change by enacting policies that keep the 
                global average surface temperature rise to 1.5 degrees 
                Celsius above pre-industrial levels;
            (3) assessing the potential impact of climate-related risks 
        on national and international financial systems is an urgent 
        concern;
            (4) companies have a duty to disclose financial risks that 
        climate change presents to their investors, lenders, and 
        insurers;
            (5) the Securities and Exchange Commission has a duty to 
        promote a risk-informed securities market that is worthy of the 
        trust of the public as families invest for their futures;
            (6) investors, lenders, and insurers are increasingly 
        demanding climate risk information that is consistent, 
        comparable, reliable, and clear;
            (7) including standardized, material climate change risk 
        and opportunity disclosure that is useful for decision makers 
        in annual reports to the Commission will increase transparency 
        with respect to risk accumulation and exposure in financial 
        markets;
            (8) requiring companies to disclose climate-related risk 
        exposure and risk management strategies will encourage a 
        smoother transition to a clean and renewable energy, low-
        emissions economy and guide capital allocation to mitigate, and 
        adapt to, the effects of climate change and limit damages 
        associated with climate-related events and disasters; and
            (9) a critical component in fighting climate change is a 
        transparent accounting of the risks that climate change 
        presents and the implications of continued inaction with 
        respect to climate change.

SEC. 403. DISCLOSURES RELATING TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

               TITLE VI--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT DISCLOSURE

SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Workforce Investment Disclosure 
Act of 2021''.

SEC. 602. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) One of the keys to the 20th century post-war economic 
        success of the United States was the ability to prepare workers 
        over the course of their lives for success through multiple 
        sectors across society. Unfortunately, during the several 
        decades preceding the date of enactment of this Act, there has 
        been a shift in business norms and in society. While Congress 
        recognizes that the technology and job skills required for some 
        jobs has changed dramatically, the private and public 
        partnership to hire workers at different education levels and 
        invest in them for the long-term is broken.
            (2) Available data from the 10-year period preceding the 
        date of enactment of this Act suggests that businesses are 
        investing less in worker training during that time period, not 
        more.
            (3) In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, there 
        was a well-documented decline in overall business investment. 
        That decline coincides with the wage polarization of workers 
        and an increase in spending on share buybacks and dividends, 
        leading several researchers to conclude that companies are de-
        emphasizing investment at the expense of increasing returns for 
        shareholders. The onset of a global pandemic may make that 
        trend worse, especially with respect to investments in workers.
            (4) As part of the overall decline in investment described 
        in paragraph (3), publicly traded companies are being provided 
        with incentives to prioritize investments in physical assets 
        over investments in their workforces, meaning that those 
        companies are investing in robots instead of individuals. In 
        fact, there are already signs that automation has increased 
        during the COVID-19 pandemic.
            (5) More than ever, the Federal Government, through company 
        disclosure practices, needs to understand exactly how companies 
        are investing in their workers. Over the several months 
        preceding the date of enactment of this Act, companies across 
        the United States have taken extreme actions to adapt and 
        respond to evolving workforce challenges presented by COVID-19.
            (6) JUST Capital has been tracking the responses of the 
        Standard and Poor's 100 largest public companies to their 
        workers and has found wide variation in the policies 
        implemented, as well as with respect to the disclosure of those 
        policies. Through different responses to their workforces, from 
        layoffs to workplace safety to paid leave, the COVID-19 
        pandemic is exposing the myriad ways that workforce management 
        practices of companies pose operational and reputational risks 
        for short- and long-term financial performance.
            (7) Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a growing 
        body of research establishing a relationship between measurable 
        workforce management, which is the way that companies manage 
        their employees, and firm performance. In a study of 2,000 
        large companies, Harvard Law School's Labor and Work Life 
        Program found that forward-thinking workforce policies that 
        prioritize workers, such as how companies train, retain, and 
        pay their workers, are correlated with long-term financial 
        performance.
            (8) Disclosure of workforce management policies should be 
        part of a Government-wide economic recovery strategy. Just as a 
        set of generally accepted accounting principles (commonly known 
        as ``GAAP'') was urgently adopted after the Great Depression, 
        standardized, comparable metrics of workforce disclosure 
        requirements in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic are 
        critical for investors to accurately measure and project 
        company performance, both in the present and in the future.
            (9) Because many companies already track workforce metrics 
        internally, moving towards a transparent disclosure regime 
        would allow investors to better judge whether companies are 
        managing risks and making the investments in their workforces 
        that are needed for long-term growth.
            (10) Businesses increasingly rely on workforce innovation 
        and intellectual capital for competitiveness. Workplace 
        benefits, particularly paid sick leave, medical leave, and 
        flexible work arrangements, critically support employee mental 
        and physical well-being.
            (11) Race- and gender-based workplace discrimination have 
        been tied to negative health outcomes, as well as lower 
        productivity, trust, morale, and satisfaction and higher rates 
        of absenteeism and turnover. Organizational reporting on 
        practices to reduce discrimination can increase employee job 
        satisfaction, performance, and engagement.
            (12) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, work-related stress is the leading occupational 
        health risk and, per the American Institute of Stress, job 
        stress costs United States industry more than $300,000,000,000 
        per year in accidents, absenteeism, employee turnover, 
        diminished productivity, and medical, legal, and insurance 
        costs.
            (13) Employee health and well-being is a key asset to 
        delivering long-term value, with 80 percent of public companies 
        that took concrete actions on health and well-being having seen 
        larger improvements in financial performance.
            (14) Organizational well-being interventions can create 
        cost savings of up to 10 dollars for every dollar invested. 
        Specifically, for every dollar that employers spend on 
        workplace disease prevention and well-being programs, there is 
        a $3.27 reduction in employee medical costs and a $2.73 
        reduction in absenteeism costs. Employers that implement 
        workplace health promotion programs have seen reductions in 
        sick leave, health plan costs, and workers' compensation and 
        disability insurance costs of approximately 25 percent.
            (15) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has 
        found that preventable chronic conditions are a major 
        contributor to insurance premium and employee medical claim 
        costs, which are at an all-time high, and a Milken Institute 
        study shows that employers paid $2,600,000,000,000 in 2016 for 
        the indirect costs of employee chronic disease due to work 
        absences, lost wages, and reduced economic productivity.
            (16) The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted employee 
        physical, mental, and emotional well-being by increasing 
        stress, depression, burnout, and mortality rates of chronic 
        disease and by reducing work-life balance and financial 
        security, with these challenges likely to persist due to 
        uncertainty and instability even as employees return to work. 
        Before the COVID-19 pandemic, but especially in the face of 
        that pandemic, employers that advance policies and practices 
        that support workforce health, safety, and well-being are 
        likely to outperform competitors and benefit from lower costs.

        any disease that is naturally transmissible between animals and 
        humans.

SEC. 4. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The majority of recent emerging infectious diseases 
        have originated in wildlife.
            (2) There is a rise in the frequency of zoonotic spillover 
        events and outbreaks of such diseases.
            (3) This rise in such spillover events and outbreaks 
        relates to the increased interaction between humans and 
        wildlife.
            (4) There is a progressive and increasing rise in 
        interaction between human populations and wildlife related to 
        deforestation, habitat degradation, and expansion of human 
        activity into the habitat of such wildlife.
            (5) The increase in such interactions due to these factors, 
        particularly in forested regions of tropical countries where 
        there is high mammalian diversity, is a serious risk factor for 
        spillover events.
            (6) A serious risk factor for spillover events also relates 
        to the collection, production, commercial trade, and sale for 
        human consumption of wildlife that may transmit to zoonotic 
        pathogens to humans that may then replicate and be transmitted 
        within the human population.
            (7) Such a risk factor is increased if it involves wildlife 
        that--
                    (A) does not ordinarily interact with humans; or
                    (B) lives under a stressful condition, as such 
                condition exacerbates the shedding of zoonotic 
                pathogens.
            (8) Markets for such wildlife to be sold for human 
        consumption are found in many countries.
            (9) In some communities, such wildlife may be the only 
        accessible source of high quality nutrition.
            (10) The public health emergency has resulted in--
                    (A) trillions of dollars in economic damage to the 
                United States; and
                    (B) the deaths of hundreds of thousands of American 
                citizens.

SEC. 5. UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD ASSISTING COUNTRIES IN PREVENTING 
              ZOONOTIC SPILLOVER EVENTS.

This bill establishes measures to address global public health risks posed by wildlife markets, which are commercial markets that sell or slaughter wildlife for human consumption as food or medicine in communities where alternative nutritional or protein sources are available.
Specifically, the bill prohibits importing, exporting, purchasing, or selling live wild animals in the United States for human consumption as food or medicine. The Department of the Interior must hire, train, and deploy at least 50 new U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service law enforcement attachés around the world, and the U.S. Agency for International Development must increase specified activities to address the threats and causes of zoonotic (animal-to-human transmission) disease outbreaks. Additionally, the United States must work with other United Nations member states to urge a global ban on commercial wildlife markets and enforcement of laws to end wildlife trafficking.
Further, the President may impose sanctions against a foreign country or foreign nationals that the Department of State has determined are taking certain actions that enable or facilitate commercial wildlife markets.
Among other reports required by the bill, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine must conduct a study and submit a report that includes an evaluation of (1) the impact that consumption of terrestrial wildlife as food or medicine has on the transmission of novel viral and other pathogens, (2) the role of consuming terrestrial wildlife as food or medicine in the transmission of microbes from animals to humans, and (3) the conditions at live wildlife markets that lead to this transmission.","To address the public health risks posed by wildlife markets, and for

                    (A) sells or slaughters terrestrial, including 
                avian, wildlife for human consumption as food or 
                medicine, whether the animals originated in the wild or 
                in a captive environment; and
                    (B) delivers a product in communities where 
                alternative nutritional or protein sources are 
                available; and
            (2) does not include markets in areas where no other 
        practical alternative sources of protein or meat exists, such 
        as wildlife markets in rural areas on which indigenous people 
        rely to feed themselves and their families.

SEC. 3. STUDY ON RISK OF WILDLIFE MARKETS ON THE EMERGENCE OF NOVEL 
              VIRAL PATHOGENS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall 
seek to enter into an agreement with the National Academies of 
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine under which the National Academies 
of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine agrees to conduct a study to 
evaluate--
            (1) the impact of physical proximity and consumption of 
        terrestrial wildlife as food or medicine on the emergence of 
        viral and other microbial pathogens;
            (2) the impact of consumption of terrestrial wildlife as 
        food or medicine on the transmission of novel viral and other 
        microbial pathogens;
            (3) the role consumption of terrestrial wildlife as food or 
        medicine has on the transmission of microbes from animals to 
        humans; and
            (4) the conditions at live wildlife markets that lead to 
        transmission of zoonotic diseases.
    (b) Report.--The agreement under subsection (a) shall require the 
National Academies to, not later than one year after the date of such 
agreement, submit a report to the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce of the House of Representatives on the findings of the study 
conducted pursuant to subsection (a).

SEC. 4. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that global 
institutions, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), 
and the World Health Organization (WHO), together with leading 
nongovernmental organizations, veterinary colleges, and the United 
States Agency for International Development (USAID), should promote the 
paradigm of One Health--the integration of human health, animal health, 
agriculture, ecosystems, and the environment as an effective and 
integrated way to address the complexity of emerging disease threats.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to 
facilitate international cooperation by working with international 
partners and through intergovernmental, international, and 
nongovernmental organizations such as the United Nations to--
            (1) lead a resolution at the United Nations Security 
        Council or General Assembly and World Health Assembly outlining 
        the danger to human and animal health from emerging zoonotic 
        infectious diseases, with recommendations for implementing the 
        worldwide closure of wildlife markets and the ending of the 
        associated commercial trade of terrestrial wildlife that feed 
        and supply those markets, except for in such countries or 
        regions where the consumption of wildlife is necessary for 
        local food security or where such actions would significantly 
        disrupt a readily available and irreplaceable food supply;
            (2) work with governments through existing treaties and the 
        United Nations to develop a new protocol or agreement, and 
        amend existing protocols or agreements, regarding stopping 
        deforestation and other ecosystem destruction, closing 
        commercial wildlife markets for human consumption, and end the 
        associated commercial trade of terrestrial wildlife that feed 
        and supply those markets while ensuring full consideration to 
        the needs and rights of indigenous peoples and local 
        communities that are dependent on wildlife for their food 
        security, national sovereignty, and local laws and customs;
            (3) disrupt and ultimately end the commercial international 
        trade in terrestrial wildlife associated with wildlife markets 
        and eliminate commercial wildlife markets;
            (4) disrupt and ultimately eliminate wildlife trafficking 
        associated with the operation of wildlife markets;
            (5) raise awareness on the dangerous potential of wildlife 
        markets as a source of zoonotic diseases such as the novel 
        coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19 and reduce demand 
        for the consumption of wildlife through evidence-based behavior 
        change programs while ensuring that existing wildlife habitat 
        is not encroached upon or destroyed as part of this process;
            (6) encourage and support alternate forms of food 
        production, farming, and shifts to domestic animal- or plant-
        source foods instead of terrestrial wildlife where able and 
        appropriate, and reduce consumer demand for terrestrial 
        wildlife through enhanced local and national food systems, 
        especially in areas where wildlife markets play a significant 
        role in meeting subsistence needs while ensuring that existing 
        wildlife habitat is not encroached upon or destroyed as part of 
        this process; and
            (7) strive to increase hygienic standards implemented in 
        markets around the globe, especially those specializing in the 
        sale of products intended for human consumption.
    (c) Activities.--
            (1) Global prohibitions and enforcement.--The United States 
        Government, working through the United Nations and its 
        components, as well as international organization such as 
        Interpol and the World Organisation for Animal Health, and in 
        furtherance of the policies described in subsection (b), 
        shall--
                    (A) collaboratively with other member states, issue 
                declarations, statements, and communiques urging a 
                global ban on commercial wildlife markets and trade for 
                human consumption; and
                    (B) urge increased enforcement of existing laws to 
                end wildlife trafficking.
            (2) International coalitions.--The Secretary of State shall 
        seek to build international coalitions focused on ending 
        commercial wildlife markets for human consumption and 
        associated wildlife trade which feeds and supplies said 
        markets, with a focus on the following efforts:
                    (A) Providing assistance and advice to other 
                governments in the adoption of legislation and 
                regulations to close wildlife markets and trade for 
                human consumption.
                    (B) Creating economic pressure on wildlife markets 
                and their supply chains to prevent their operation.
                    (C) Providing assistance and guidance to other 
                governments to prohibit the import, export, and 
                domestic trade of live terrestrial wildlife for the 
                purpose of human consumption.
                    (D) Engaging and receiving guidance from key 
                stakeholders at the ministerial, local government, and 
                civil society level in countries that will be impacted 
                by this Act and where wildlife markets and associated 
                wildlife trafficking is the predominant source of meat 
                or protein, in order to mitigate the impact of any 
                international efforts on local customs, conservation 
                methods, or cultural norms.
            (3) Authorization of imposition of sanctions.--

This bill expands the responsibilities of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to promote research methods that do not use animals. Specifically, the NIH must (1) provide incentives for nonanimal research, and (2) require the evaluation of viable nonanimal alternatives before approving any research that involves animals.
Additionally, NIH applications for research grants involving animals must include an assurance that nonanimal methods for such research are not available.","To amend the Public Health Service Act to ensure that non-animal 
 methods are prioritized, where applicable and feasible, in proposals 
     for all research to be conducted or supported by the National 
             Institutes of Health, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Humane and Existing Alternatives in 
Research and Testing Sciences Act of 2021'' or the ``HEARTS Act of 
2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The National Institutes of Health has supported life-
        saving research that has greatly improved the health and well-
        being not only of Americans but also of people around the 
        world.
            (2) Much of this research has relied on animals. It is 
        estimated that between 17 million and 22 million animals are 
        used annually in the United States in research, education, and 
        testing.
            (3) At the same time, however, a great deal of research 
        that utilized animal studies yielded no benefits for humans. 
        For example, according to NIH itself, ``approximately 30 
        percent of promising medications have failed in human clinical 
        trials because they are found to be toxic despite promising 
        pre-clinical studies in animal models. About 60 percent of 
        candidate drugs fail due to lack of efficacy''.
            (4) The laboratory use of animals has also long been an 
        issue of public concern because animals will, in most cases, 
        experience fear, pain, disease or surgery, and early death.
            (5) Much more has become known about the unsuitability of 
        animal models for studying human disease and many more humane, 
        cost-effective, and scientifically suitable non-animal methods 
        are available.
            (6) Under the system of oversight established by the Animal 
        Welfare Act (Public Law 89-544), researchers are supposed to 
        consider alternatives to animal use or painful procedures and 
        should not unnecessarily duplicate previous experiments. 
        However, oversight is generally weak and little heed is paid to 
        the use of non-animal methods or the avoidance of duplication, 
        thereby unnecessarily subjecting animals to pain, suffering, 
        and death.
            (7) A system of active incentives is needed to encourage 
        researchers to utilize humane, cost-effective, and 
        scientifically suitable non-animal methods.

SEC. 3. ANIMALS IN RESEARCH.

    Section 495 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 289d) is 
amended--

                respectively, and moving the margins of such

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Puppies Assisting Wounded 
Servicemembers Act of 2021'' or the ``PAWS Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) According to the analysis of veteran suicide published 
        by the Department of Veterans Affairs in November 2020 entitled 
        ``VA National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report''--
                    (A) an average of 17.6 veterans died by suicide 
                each day in 2018;
                    (B) mental health disorders, including major 
                depression and other mood disorders, have been 
                associated with increased risk for suicide;
                    (C) nearly 60 percent of veterans who received care 
                from the Veterans Health Administration and died by 
                suicide in 2018 had a mental health or substance use 
                disorder diagnosis within the two-year period preceding 
                their death; and
                    (D) in 2018, patients of the Veterans Health 
                Administration with a mental health or substance abuse 
                disorder diagnosis had a suicide rate of 57.2 patients 
                per 100,000, compared to a suicide rate of 58.6 
                patients per 100,000 in 2005.
            (2) Pairing a service dog with a veteran costs 
        approximately $25,000, including with respect to training of 
        the service dog as well as training of the veteran with the 
        service dog.
            (3) New, rigorous scientific research provides persuasive 
        weight to the growing anecdotal evidence that service dogs 
        ameliorate the symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress 
        disorder, and in particular, help prevent veteran suicide.
            (4) According to the results of a recent study by the 
        Veterans Health Administration, veterans paired with service 
        dogs over an 18-month period experienced a 3.7 percent 
        improvement on the post-traumatic stress disorder checklist 
        (PCL-5) and also saw a decrease in depression and suicidal 
        measures.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Department of Veterans Affairs must be more effective in its approach 
to reducing the burden of veteran suicide connected to mental health 
disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, and should use all 
tools at its disposal, including innovative treatments such as pairing 
service dogs with veterans suffering from mental health disorders.

This bill addresses the use of certain pesticides and the health and status of native bees and other pollinators.
First, the bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a Pollinator Protection Board to develop an independent review process for pesticides that pose a threat to pollinators and their habitats.
All active ingredients and pesticide products that contain one or more specified neonicotinoid pesticides must be deemed to generally cause unreasonable adverse effects to the environment. Under the bill, the registration of all uses of neonicotinoid pesticides must be immediately and permanently canceled.
The EPA must revoke any tolerance or exemption that allows the presence of a neonicotinoid pesticide, or any pesticide chemical residue that results from neonicotinoid pesticide use, in or on food.
The continued sale or use of existing stocks of neonicotinoid pesticides is prohibited, and the EPA may not register any such pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act.
The bill requires the Department of the Interior, the EPA, and the Department of Agriculture to coordinate monitoring activities and report on the health and population status of native bees and other pollinators.
Finally, a state or federal agency may be granted an exemption to use neonicotinoid pesticides if the board votes that use of the pesticide is warranted (1) in an emergency situation to avert significant risk to threatened or endangered species, (2) to quarantine invasive species, or (3) to protect public health.","To direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Saving America's Pollinators Act of 
2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Pollination services are a vital part of agricultural 
        production, valued at over $125,000,000,000 globally. According 
        to a 2014 Presidential memorandum, pollinators provide for an 
        annual amount of $24,000,000,000 to the economy of the United 
        States and honey bees account for $15,000,000,000 of such 
        amount. Similarly, pollination services of native pollinators, 
        such as bumblebees, squash bees, and mason bees, contribute 
        over $3,000,000,000 to the United States agricultural economy 
        and are estimated to contribute between $937,000,000 and 
        $2,400,000,000 to the economy of California alone.
            (2) One-third of food produced in North America--including 
        nearly 100 varieties of fruits and vegetables such as almonds, 
        avocados, cranberries, and apples--depends on pollination by 
        bees.
            (3) Over the past several years, documented incidents of 
        colony collapse disorder and other forms of excess bee 
        mortality have been at a record high, with some beekeepers 
        repeatedly losing 100 percent of their operations. The national 
        honey crop reported in 2017 was the lowest in many decades.
            (4) National surveys sponsored by the Federal Government 
        indicates that United States beekeepers lost between 35 and 46 
        percent of their hives annually between 2012 and 2018. On 
        average, two-thirds of beekeepers experienced loss rates 
        greater than the established acceptable winter mortality rates.
            (5) According to scientists at the Department of 
        Agriculture, current losses of honey bee colonies are too high 
        to confidently ensure the United States will be able to meet 
        the pollination demands for agricultural crops.
            (6) Native pollinators, such as bumblebees, have also 
        suffered alarming population declines. There are currently more 
        than 40 pollinator species federally listed as threatened or 
        endangered, and most recently, the iconic monarch butterfly has 
        declined by 90 percent.
            (7) Scientists have linked the use of a certain class of 
        systemic insecticides, known as neonicotinoids, to the rapid 
        decline of pollinators and to the deterioration of pollinator 
        health.
            (8) Neonicotinoids cause sublethal effects, including 
        impaired foraging and feeding behavior, disorientation, 
        weakened immunity, delayed larval development, and increased 
        susceptibility to viruses, diseases, and parasites. Numerous 
        reports also document acute, lethal effects from the 
        application of neonicotinoids.
            (9) Conclusions from a recent global review of the impacts 
        of systemic pesticides, primarily neonicotinoids, warn that 
        they are causing significant damage to a wide range of 
        beneficial invertebrate species, are a key factor in the 
        decline of bees, and pose a global threat to biodiversity and 
        ecosystem services. Another recent global review documented 
        high levels of freshwater contamination.
            (10) Science has demonstrated that a single corn kernel 
        coated with a neonicotinoid is toxic enough to kill a songbird. 
        Peer-reviewed research from the Netherlands has shown that the 
        most severe bird population declines occurred in those areas 
        where neonicotinoid pollution was highest. Starlings, tree 
        sparrows, and swallows were among the most affected.
            (11) In June 2013, over 50,000 bumblebees were killed as a 
        direct result of exposure to a neonicotinoid applied to linden 
        trees for cosmetic purposes.
            (12) In February 2014, Eugene, Oregon, voted to ban the use 
        of neonicotinoid pesticides on city property. Similar bans and 
        restrictions have been enacted in Thurston County, Spokane, and 
        Seattle, Washington, Portland, Oregon, Skagway, Alaska, and 
        several other communities across the United States. The States 
        of Connecticut, Maryland, and Vermont have all passed laws 
        restricting consumer use of neonicotinoids in favor of less 
        toxic alternative products and practices.
            (13) In June 2014, a Presidential memorandum established a 
        Pollinator Health Task Force after identifying pollinator 
        decline as a threat to the sustainability of food production 
        systems, the agricultural economy, and the health of the 
        environment in the United States.
            (14) In July 2014, the United States Fish and Wildlife 
        Service announced plans to phase out neonicotinoid pesticides 
        in all national wildlife refuges across the United States by 
        January 2016. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service 
        recognized that the prophylactic use of neonicotinoids for 
        agricultural purposes harms a wide range of nontarget species 
        and is therefore inconsistent with the management policy of the 
        United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
            (15) In October 2014, an assessment by the Environmental 
        Protection Agency found that neonicotinoid seed coatings 
        provide little benefit to overall soybean crop yield. 
        Additional studies determined that in approximately 80 to 90 
        percent of row crop uses, neonicotinoid coatings are 
        unnecessary. The prophylactic overuse of neonicotinoids 
        violates the fundamental principles of integrated pest 
        management.
            (16) In November 2014, the Province of Ontario, Canada, 
        announced the province will move to restrict the use of 
        neonicotinoid-coated corn and soybean seeds because of the 
        broad harms from their overuse, with a goal of 80 percent 
        reduction by 2017.
            (17) In September 2015, the Circuit Court of the United 
        States for the Ninth Circuit ruled to revoke the Environmental 
        Protection Agency's approval for sulfoxaflor--a neonicotinoid 
        pesticide.
            (18) In November 2016, Health Canada, the department of the 
        Government of Canada responsible for national public health, 
        proposed a ban on almost all outdoor uses of the neonicotinoid 
        imidacloprid, saying it is contaminating Canadian waterways at 
        levels that can harm insects and the ecosystem.
            (19) The President's budget for fiscal year 2018 cuts 
        funding for pesticide review programs of the Environmental 
        Protection Agency by 20 percent delaying reviews of new, 
        potentially safer pesticides as well as reviews of older, more 
        dangerous pesticides such as neonicotinoids.
            (20) In 2018, the European Union permanently banned outdoor 
        uses of the neonicotinoids imidacloprid, clothianidin, and 
        thiamethoxam after the European Food Safety Authority confirmed 
        their risks to honey bees and wild bees.
            (21) In August 2018, Health Canada, proposed a ban on 
        almost all outdoor uses of clothianidin and thiamethoxam 
        similar to the proposed ban on imidacloprid, citing concerns 
        that the chemicals are contaminating Canadian waterways at 
        levels that can harm insects and the ecosystem.
            (22) Worldwide, insects are experiencing population 
        declines twice as high as those of vertebrate species, with a 
        rate of local species extinction eight times higher than that 
        of vertebrate species. About one-third of all insect species 
        are threatened with extinction, with 1 percent added every 
        year. Such declines result in an annual 2.5 percent loss in 
        biomass, which threatens the overall functioning and stability 
        of ecosystems worldwide.
            (23) Insect biodiversity is essential to the proper 
        functioning of ecosystems, and declines are disrupting 
        pollination, natural pest control, food resources, nutrient 
        recycling, and decomposition services provided by insects.
            (24) Major declines in insect populations can be traced to 
        the expansion of intensive, industrial agriculture, including 
        the systematic and widespread use of insecticides, herbicides, 
        fungicides, and chemical fertilizers.
            (25) Because insects constitute the world's most abundant 
        and speciose animal group and provide critical services within 
        ecosystems, such event cannot be ignored and should prompt 
        decisive action to avert a catastrophic collapse of nature's 
        ecosystems.

                convene technical advisory panels, without conflicts of 
                interest, to provide scientific evaluation of 
                pesticides under paragraph (1). Such panels may include 
                experts in agronomy, entomology, conservation ecology, 
                health sciences, toxicology, and other relevant 
                disciplines.
            (2) Determinations.--
                    (A) In general.--After conducting evaluation 
                procedures, the Board shall hold a vote regarding 
                whether registration of the evaluated pesticide under 
                section 3 or 4 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, 
                and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136a) presents an 
                unacceptable hazard, based upon the potential to cause 
                harm, including injury, illness, or damage to honey 
                bees, and other pollinators, or pollinator habitat. 
                Such determination shall be made on the basis of the 
                factors specified in paragraph (1)(A). The registration 
                of an evaluated pesticide shall only be affirmed by a 
                decisive vote of the Board finding the pesticide does 
                not present an unacceptable hazard-based upon the 
                potential to cause harm, including injury, illness, or 
                damage to honey bees, and other pollinators, or 
                pollinator habitat.
                    (B) No vote.--If an evaluated pesticide's 
                registration is not affirmed by a decisive vote of the 
                Board, the Administrator shall within 30 days issue a 
                notice of intent to cancel the registration of a 
                pesticide pursuant to section 6 of the Federal 
                Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 
                136d).
                    (C) Cancellation.--Pesticides subject to 
                cancellation procedures as a result of the Board's 
                determination are prohibited from continued sale and 
                use of existing stocks.
                    (D) Denial of registration.--If a pesticide not yet 
                registered under section 3 or 4 of the Federal 
                Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 
                136a) is not affirmed registration by a decisive vote, 
                the Administrator shall deny registration under such 
                sections.
            (3) Prioritizing reviews.--
                    (A) In general.--The Board shall establish 
                procedures to evaluate registered pesticides for their 
                harm to pollinators and pollinator habitat, 
                prioritizing those identified by the Environmental 
                Protection Agency or peer-reviewed scientific 
                literature as posing acute or chronic risks to honey 
                bees or other pollinators. The Board may collectively 
                evaluate and vote upon pesticides associated with one 
                or more related active ingredients to enhance the 
                efficiency of its review.
                    (B) Priority.--The Board shall review pesticides 
                prior to registration under sections 3 and 4 of the 
                Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 
                U.S.C. 136a) if preliminary data indicates acute or 
                chronic risks to honey bees or other pollinators. Such 
                pesticides shall be prioritized by the Board.
                    (C) Petition.--Any person may petition the Board to 
                prioritize review of one or more pesticides.
            (4) Report.--Pesticides not affirmed for registration by a 
        decisive vote of the Board shall be transmitted to the 
        Administrator in a formal report. Such a report shall outline 
        in detail the Board's reasoning for its determination.
    (l) No Additions.--The Administrator may not include exemptions for 
the use of specific substances or specific uses of substances proposed 
for cancellation by the Board.
    (m) Notice and Comment.--Before issuing the cancellation, the 
Administrator shall seek public comment on such proposals, and may 
adopt standards that are only more restrictive than the Board's 
determination.

This bill eliminates new fossil fuel production projects on federal public land and waters.
Specifically, it prohibits the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) from issuing, renewing, reinstating, or extending any nonproducing lease, or issuing any authorization for the exploration or production of fossil fuel on the Outer Continental Shelf. BOEM must also cancel any lease issued in the Beaufort Sea, Cook Inlet, or Chukchi Sea (three of the five bodies of water that encompass the Alaska Outer Continental Shelf).
Further, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) may not issue, renew, reinstate, or extend any nonproducing lease for the exploration or production of any onshore fossil fuels on land subject to the Mineral Leasing Act.
The bill provides for exceptions if there is an imminent national security threat that would be significantly reduced by granting an exception. In addition, BOEM and the BLM may allow a nonproducing lease to be renewed or extended if (1) the lease contract was signed before enactment of this bill, and (2) it is determined that giving effect to any provision of this bill is likely to lead to a judicial ruling that there was a material breach of the nonproducing lease contract.","To prohibit drilling in the outer Continental Shelf, to prohibit coal

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Keep It in the Ground Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) from 1880 through 2015, global temperatures have 
        increased by about 1.06 degrees Celsius;
            (2) the vast majority of global warming that has occurred 
        over the past 50 years was due to human activities, primarily 
        the burning of fossil fuels;
            (3) emissions of greenhouse gases and atmospheric 
        concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to rise, which 
        results in a continued warming trend;
            (4) global warming already has a significant impact on the 
        economy, including the farming, fishing, forestry, and 
        recreation industries;
            (5) the significant impacts of global warming that are 
        already occurring will be amplified by a global temperature 
        increase of 2 degrees Celsius, which will lead to increased 
        droughts, rising seas, mass extinctions, heat waves, 
        desertification, wildfires, acidifying oceans, significant 
        economic disruption, and security threats;
            (6) to avoid exceeding 2 degrees Celsius warming, at least 
        80 percent of carbon from proven fossil fuel reserves must be 
        kept in the ground;
            (7) the potential emissions resulting from extracting and 
        burning all fossil fuels on Federal land and waters amounts to 
        a significant percentage of the greenhouse gas emissions limit; 
        and
            (8) ending new leases for fossil fuels will prevent the 
        release of 90 percent of the potential emissions from Federal 
        fossil fuels.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States 
that--
            (1) Federal land and waters should be managed for the 
        benefit of the people of the United States--
                    (A) to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate 
                change; and
                    (B) to promote a rapid transition to a clean energy 
                economy by keeping fossil fuels in the ground; and
            (2) the Federal Government should pursue management of 
        Federal land and waters for the benefit of the people of the 
        United States by not issuing any new lease or renewing any 
        nonproducing lease for coal, oil, or natural gas in any Federal 
        land or waters.

                    (A) there is an imminent national security threat; 
                and
                    (B) issuing an exemption for the lease would 
                significantly reduce the imminent national security 
                threat.
            (2) Duration.--An exemption under paragraph (1) shall

                any provision of this Act or an amendment made by this 
                Act is likely to lead to a court with jurisdiction 
                ruling that there was a material breach of the 
                nonproducing lease contract.
            (2) Duration.--A renewal or extension under paragraph (1) 
        shall be for the shortest time practicable, consistent with the 
        terms of the nonproducing lease contract.

SEC. 7. SEVERABILITY.

    If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this Act, or the 
application of such a provision or amendment to any person or 
circumstance is held to be invalid or unconstitutional, the remainder

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Bear Protection Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) all 8 extant species of bear--Asian black bear, brown 
        bear, polar bear, American black bear, spectacled bear, giant 
        panda, sun bear, and sloth bear--are listed on appendix I or II 
        of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species 
        of Wild Fauna and Flora (27 UST 1087; TIAS 8249) (referred to 
        in this section as ``CITES'');
            (2) Article XIV of CITES provides that Parties to CITES may 
        adopt stricter domestic measures regarding the conditions for 
        trade, taking, possession, or transport of species listed on 
        appendix I or II, and the Parties to CITES adopted a resolution 
        in 1997 (Conf. 10.8) urging the Parties to take immediate 
        action to demonstrably reduce the illegal trade in bear parts;
            (3) thousands of bears in Asia are cruelly confined in 
        small cages to be milked for their bile, and the wild Asian 
        bear population has declined significantly in recent years, as 
        a result of habitat loss and poaching due to a strong demand 
        for bear viscera used in traditional medicines and cosmetics;
            (4) Federal and State undercover operations have revealed 
        that American bears have been poached for their viscera;
            (5) while most American black bear populations are 
        generally stable or increasing, commercial trade could 
        stimulate poaching and threaten certain populations if the 
        demand for bear viscera increases; and
            (6) prohibitions against the importation into the United 
        States and exportation from the United States, as well as 
        prohibitions against the interstate trade, of bear viscera and 
        products containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, 
        bear viscera will assist in ensuring that the United States 
        does not contribute to the decline of any bear population as a 
        result of the commercial trade in bear viscera.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

    The purpose of this Act is to ensure the long-term viability of the 
world's 8 bear species by--
            (1) prohibiting interstate and international trade in bear 
        viscera and products containing, or labeled or advertised as 
        containing, bear viscera;
            (2) encouraging bilateral and multilateral efforts to 
        eliminate such trade; and
            (3) ensuring that adequate Federal legislation exists with 
        respect to domestic trade in bear viscera and products 
        containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, bear 
        viscera.

SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.

            (2) Import.--The term ``import'' means to land on, bring 
        into, or introduce into any place subject to the jurisdiction 
        of the United States, whether or not the landing, bringing, or 
        introduction constitutes an importation within the meaning of 
        the customs laws of the United States.
            (3) Person.--The term ``person'' means--
                    (A) an individual, corporation, partnership, trust, 
                association, or other private entity;
                    (B) an officer, employee, agent, department, or 
                instrumentality of--
                            (i) the Federal Government;

Additionally, the bill provides incentives to research or develop other carbon sequestration tools.
Specifically, the bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to set targets to increase forest carbon stock through January 1, 2100, for the purposes of sequestering and storing carbon in U.S. forests.
It also establishes and provides funding for the Trillion Trees Challenge Fund to provide grants to nonfederal entities for activities related to reforestation efforts on public or private lands. In addition, it raises the cap on the Reforestation Trust Fund to enhance forest health in the National Forest System and requires the USDA to establish a Tree City USA Grant Program.
The bill also allows the U.S. Agency for International Development to enter into an agreement with a nonprofit organization to establish an International Forest Foundation to promote reforestation and prevent deforestation.
Additionally, it establishes requirements and incentives to address seedling shortages and support nurseries.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Nutrition Education Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Section 9A of the Richard B. Russell National School 
        Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1758b) requires all local educational 
        agencies participating in a program authorized by the Richard 
        B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) 
        or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq.) to 
        establish a local school wellness policy for schools under the 
        jurisdiction of local educational agencies that include 
        nutrition promotion and education. However, there are no 
        specific requirements regarding the amount of time or type of 
        classes that school children have to spend or take in nutrition 
        education.
            (2) Some schools include in their health education classes 
        some general information about nutrition, but there are no 
        specific guidelines of what the minimum requirements should be. 
        The mean number of hours spent on nutrition education in the 
        first 4 years of school is only 13 hours per year. A minimum of 
        50 hours per year are thought to be necessary to influence 
        behavior.
            (3) Each local educational agency participating in a 
        program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School 
        Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) or the Child Nutrition Act 
        of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq.) should have a minimum 
        requirement for amount of time per year students should spend 
        on nutrition education and the type of instruction that should 
        be provided as part of such education.

SEC. 3. SCHOOL NUTRITION EDUCATION REQUIREMENT.

    (a) Amendments.--Section 9A(b) of the Richard B. Russell National 
School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1758b(b)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``nutrition promotion and 
        education, physical activity,'' and inserting ``physical 
        activity'';
            (2) by redesignating paragraphs (2) through (5) as 
        paragraphs (3) through (6), respectively; and
            (3) by inserting after paragraph (1), the following:
            ``(2) a requirement for 50 hours of school nutrition 
        education during a school year for each student at a school

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Pigs in Gestation Stalls Act of 
2022'' or the ``PIGS Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Intensive confinement of pigs is a significant animal 
        welfare issue, causing physical problems and psychological 
        anguish for the animals.
            (2) Dozens of major food retailers and more than 10 states 
        have taken action to phase out the use of intensive confinement 
        for pigs, reflecting the will and concerns of the public.
            (3) At least two States have adopted policies to forbid the 
        sale of pork from factory farms that use gestation crates, with 
        that policy predicated on human health and animal welfare 
        concerns.
            (4) As more consumers turn away from purchasing pork 
        products derived from intensive confinement practices, the pork 
        industry will be better aligned with its customers by ending 
        these unpopular and inhumane housing methods.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON CONFINING BREEDING PIGS.

    (a) In General.--The Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2131 et seq.) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:

contracted for by any person in the cosmetic product's supply chain 
after such date.
    (c) Data Use.--
            (1) In general.--No evidence derived from animal testing 
        conducted after the effective date specified in subsection (a) 
        may be relied upon to establish the safety of a cosmetic, 
        cosmetic ingredient, or nonfunctional constituent under the 
        Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), 
        unless--
                    (A) in the case of such testing on an ingredient or 
                nonfunctional constituent, there is no non-animal 
                alternative method or strategy recognized by any 
                Federal agency, the Interagency Coordinating Committee 
                on the Validation of Alternative Methods, or the 
                Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
                for the relevant safety endpoints for such ingredient 
                or nonfunctional constituent; and
                    (B)(i) such animal testing is subject to an 
                exemption under paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (d); 
                or
                    (ii)(I) such animal testing is subject to an 
                exemption under paragraph (4) of subsection (d);
                    (II) there is documented evidence of the non-
                cosmetic intent of the test; and
                    (III) there is a history of use of the ingredient 
                outside of cosmetics at least 1 year prior to the 
                reliance on such data.
            (2) Limitation.--This section shall not be construed to 
        prohibit any entity from reviewing, assessing, or retaining 
        evidence generated from animal testing.
    (d) Exemptions.--Subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply with 
respect to animal testing--
            (1) conducted outside the United States in order to comply 
        with a requirement from a foreign regulatory authority;
            (2) requested, required, or conducted by the Secretary, 
        following--
                    (A) a written finding by the Secretary that--
                            (i) there is no non-animal alternative 
                        method or strategy recognized by any Federal 
                        agency, the Interagency Coordinating Committee 
                        on the Validation of Alternative Methods, or 
                        the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
                        Development for the relevant safety endpoints 
                        for the cosmetic ingredient or nonfunctional 
                        constituent;
                            (ii) there is a reasonable probability that 
                        the ingredient or nonfunctional constituent 
                        poses a specific and serious adverse human 
                        health risk and the need to conduct an animal 
                        test is justified and supported by a detailed 
                        research protocol that is proposed for the 
                        basis for evaluation of the cosmetic ingredient 
                        or nonfunctional constituent; and
                            (iii) the cosmetic ingredient or 
                        nonfunctional constituent is in wide use and, 
                        in the case of a cosmetic ingredient, cannot be 
                        replaced by another cosmetic ingredient capable 
                        of performing a similar function;
                    (B) publication by the Secretary, on the website of 
                the Food and Drug Administration, of the written 
                finding under subparagraph (A) together with a notice 
                that the Secretary intends to request, require, or 
                conduct new animal testing, and providing a period of 
                not less than 60 calendar days for public comment; and
                    (C) a written determination by the Secretary, after 
                review of all public comments received pursuant to 
                subparagraph (B), that no previously generated data 
                that could be substituted for, or otherwise determined 
                sufficient to replace, the data expected to be produced 
                through new animal testing is available for review by 
                the Secretary;
            (3) conducted for any product or ingredient that is subject 
        to regulation under chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and

            (4) conducted for non-cosmetic purposes pursuant to a 
        requirement of a Federal, State, or foreign regulatory 
        authority.
    (e) Rule of Construction.--With the exception of records or other 
information demonstrating compliance with subsection (c)(1)(B)(ii), 
nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the Secretary 
to impose any new recordkeeping requirements relating to cosmetic 
animal testing.
    (f) Civil Penalties.--
            (1) In general.--In addition to any other penalties under 
        applicable law, any person who violates this section may be 
        subject to a civil penalty in an amount of not more than 
        $10,000 for each such violation, as determined by the 
        Secretary.
            (2) Multiple violations.--Each violation of this section 
        with respect to a separate animal, and each day that a 
        violation of this Act continues, constitutes a separate 
        offense.
    (g) Records Access.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary may request any records or 
        other information from a cosmetic manufacturer that such 
        manufacturer relied upon to meet the criteria in subsection 
        (c)(1)(B)(ii). Such manufacturer shall, upon such request of 
        the Secretary in writing, provide to the Secretary such records 
        or other information, within a reasonable timeframe, within 
        reasonable limits, and in a reasonable manner, and in either 
        electronic or physical form, at the expense of such 
        manufacturer. The Secretary's request shall include a 
        sufficient description of the records requested and reference 
        this subsection.
            (2) Confirmation of receipt.--Upon receipt of the records 
        requested under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall provide to 
        the manufacturer confirmation of receipt.
            (3) Inspection authority.--Nothing in this subsection 
        supplants the authority of the Secretary to conduct inspections 
        otherwise permitted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
        Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.).
    (h) State Authority.--No State or political subdivision of a State 
may establish or continue in effect any prohibition relating to 
cosmetic animal testing, or to the regulation of data use, labeling, 
and packaging related to animal testing, that is not identical to the 
prohibitions set forth in subsections (a), (b), (c), and (j) and that 
does not include the exemptions contained in subsections (c), (d), and

                days for public comment regarding such strategic plan;
                    (C) include in the strategic plan developed under 
                subparagraph (A) a list (which the Secretary shall 
                update on a regular basis, and which shall be for 
                informational purposes and shall not be deemed to 
                constitute a list of the only acceptable non-animal 
                test methods) of--
                            (i) scientifically reliable and relevant 
                        non-animal test methodology as alternatives to

                        strategies that have been accepted by the 
                        Secretary; and
                    (D) to the maximum extent practicable given 
                available resources, prioritize and carry out 
                performance assessment, validation, and translational 
                studies to accelerate the development of scientifically 
                valid test methods and strategies that replace the use 
                of vertebrate animals.

                person in the supply chain at the direction or request 
                of the cosmetic product manufacturer; or
                    (ii) the cosmetic product manufacturer relied upon 
                evidence from such testing, pursuant to subsection 
                (c)(1)(B)(ii), to establish the safety of such product, 
                ingredient, or nonfunctional constituent under chapter 
                VI of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Nudging Users to Drive Good 
Experiences on Social Media Act'' or the ``Social Media NUDGE Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Social media platforms can have significant impacts on 
        their users, both positive and negative. However, social media 
        usage can be associated with detrimental outcomes, including on 
        a user's mental and physical health. Design decisions made by 
        social media platforms, such as decisions affecting the content 
        a user might see on a social media platform, may drive or 
        exacerbate these negative or detrimental outcomes.
            (2) Viral harmful content often spreads on social media 
        platforms. Social media platforms do not consistently enforce 
        their terms of service and content policies, leading to 
        supposedly prohibited content often being shown to users and 
        amplified by such platforms.
            (3) Social media platforms often rely heavily on automated 
        measures for content detection and moderation. These social 
        media platforms may rely on such automated measures due to the 
        large quantity of user-generated content on their platforms. 
        However, evidence suggests that even state-of-the-art automated 
        content moderation systems currently do not fully address the 
        harmful content on social media platforms.
            (4) Significant research has found that content-agnostic 
        interventions, if made by social media platforms, may help 
        significantly mitigate these issues. These interventions could 
        be readily implemented by social media platforms to provide 
        safer user experiences. Such interventions include the 
        following:
                    (A) Nudges to users and increased platform viewing 
                options, such as screen time alerts and grayscale phone 
                settings, which may reduce addictive platform usage 
                patterns and improve user experiences online.
                    (B) Labels and alerts that require a user to read 
                or review user-generated content before sharing such 
                content.
                    (C) Prompts to users, which may help users identify 
                manipulative and microtargeted advertisements.
                    (D) Other research-supported content-agnostic 
                interventions.
            (5) Evidence suggests that increased adoption of content-
        agnostic interventions would lead to improved outcomes of 
        social media usage. However, social media platforms may be 
        hesitant to independently implement content-agnostic 
        interventions that will reduce negative outcomes associated 
        with social media use.

SEC. 3. STUDY ON CONTENT-AGNOSTIC INTERVENTIONS.

    (a) Study To Identify Content-Agnostic Interventions.--The Director 
of the National Science Foundation (in this section referred to as the 
``Director'') shall enter into an agreement with the National Academies 
of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (in this section referred to as 
the ``Academies'') to conduct ongoing studies to identify content-
agnostic interventions that covered platforms could implement to reduce 
the harms of algorithmic amplification and social media addiction on 
covered platforms. The initial study shall--
            (1) identify ways to define and measure the negative mental 
        or physical health impacts related to social media, including 
        harms related to algorithmic amplification and social media 
        addiction, through a review of--
                    (A) a wide variety of studies, literature, reports, 
                and other relevant materials created by academic 
                institutions, civil society groups, and other 
                appropriate sources; and
                    (B) relevant internal research conducted by a 
                covered platform or third-party research in the 
                possession of a covered platform that is voluntarily 
                submitted to the Academies by the covered platform 
                (through a process, established by the Academies, with 
                appropriate privacy safeguards);
            (2) identify research-based content-agnostic interventions, 
        such as reasonable limits on account creation and content 
        sharing, to combat problematic smartphone use and other 
        negative mental or physical health impacts related to social 
        media, including through a review of the materials described in 
        subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1);
            (3) provide recommendations on how covered platforms may be 
        separated into groups of similar platforms for the purpose of 
        implementing content-agnostic interventions, taking into 
        consideration factors including any similarity among the 
        covered platforms with respect to--
                    (A) the number of monthly active users of the 
                covered platform and the growth rate of such number;
                    (B) how user-generated content is created, shared, 
                amplified, and interacted with on the covered platform;
                    (C) how the covered platform generates revenue; and
                    (D) other relevant factors for providing 
                recommendations on how covered platforms may be 
                separated into groups of similar platforms;
            (4) for each group of covered platforms recommended under 
        paragraph (3), provide recommendations on which of the content-
        agnostic interventions identified in paragraph (2) are 
        generally applicable to the covered platforms in such group;
            (5) for each group of covered platforms recommended under 
        paragraph (3), provide recommendations on how the covered 
        platforms in such group could generally implement each of the 
        content-agnostic interventions identified for such group under 
        paragraph (4) in a way that does not alter the core 
        functionality of the covered platforms, considering--
                    (A) whether the content-agnostic intervention 
                should be offered as an optional setting or feature 
                that users of a covered platform could manually turn on 
                or off with appropriate default settings to reduce the 
                harms of algorithmic amplification and social media 
                addiction on the covered platform without altering the 
                core functionality of the covered platform; and
                    (B) other means by which the content-agnostic 
                intervention may be implemented and any associated 
                impact on the experiences of users of the covered 
                platform and the core functionality of the covered 
                platform;
            (6) for each group of covered platforms recommended under 
        paragraph (3), define metrics generally applicable to the 
        covered platforms in such group to measure and publicly report 
        in a privacy-preserving manner the impact of any content-
        agnostic intervention adopted by the covered platform; and
            (7) identify data and research questions necessary to 
        further understand the negative mental or physical health 
        impacts related to social media, including harms related to 
        algorithmic amplification and social media addiction.
    (b) Requirement To Submit Additional Research.--If a covered 
platform voluntarily submits internal research to the Academies under 
subsection (a)(1)(B), the covered platform shall, upon the request of 
the Academies and not later than 60 days after receiving such a 
request, submit to the Academies any other research in the platform's 
possession that is closely related to such voluntarily submitted 
research.
    (c) Reports.--
            (1) Initial study report.--Not later than 1 year after the 
        date of enactment of this Act, the Academies shall submit to 
        the Director, Congress, and the Commission a report containing 
        the results of the initial study conducted under subsection 
        (a), including recommendations for how the Commission should 
        establish rules for covered platforms related to content-
        agnostic interventions as described in paragraphs (1) through 
        (5) of subsection (a).
            (2) Updates.--Not later than 2 years after the effective 
        date of the regulations promulgated under section 4, and every 
        2 years thereafter during the 10-year period beginning on such 
        date, the Academies shall submit to the Director, Congress, and 
        the Commission a report containing the results of the ongoing 
        studies conducted under subsection (a). Each such report 
        shall--
                    (A) include analysis and updates to earlier studies 
                conducted, and recommendations made, under such 
                subsection;
                    (B) be based on--
                            (i) new academic research, reports, and 
                        other relevant materials related to the subject 
                        of previous studies, including additional 
                        research identifying new content-agnostic 
                        interventions; and
                            (ii) new academic research, reports, and 
                        other relevant materials about harms occurring 
                        on covered platforms that are not being 
                        addressed by the content-agnostic interventions 
                        being implemented by covered platforms as a 
                        result of the regulations promulgated under 
                        section 4;
                    (C) include information about the implementation of 
                the content-agnostic interventions by covered platforms 
                and the impact of the implementation of the content-
                agnostic interventions; and
                    (D) include an analysis of any entities that have 
                newly met the criteria to be considered a covered 
                platform under this Act since the last report submitted 
                under this subsection.

    (a) Determination of Applicable Content-Agnostic Interventions.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the receipt 
        of the initial study report under section 3(c)(1), the 
        Commission shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding for the 
        purpose of promulgating regulations in accordance with section 
        553 of title 5, United States Code--
                    (A) to determine how covered platforms should be 
                grouped together;
                    (B) to determine which content-agnostic 
                interventions identified in such report shall be 
                applicable to each group of covered platforms 
                identified in the report; and
                    (C) to require each covered platform to implement 
                and measure the impact of such content-agnostic 
                interventions in accordance with subsection (b).
            (2) Considerations.--In the rulemaking proceeding described 
        in paragraph (1), the Commission--
                    (A) shall consider the report under section 3(c)(1) 
                and its recommendations; and
                    (B) shall not promulgate regulations requiring any 
                covered platform to implement a content-agnostic 
                intervention that is not discussed in such report.
            (3) Notification to covered platforms.--The Commission 
        shall, not later than 30 days after the promulgation of the 
        regulations under this subsection, provide notice to each 
        covered platform of the content-agnostic interventions that are 
        applicable to the platform pursuant to the regulations 
        promulgated under this subsection.
    (b) Implementation of Content-Agnostic Interventions.--
            (1) In general.--
                    (A) Implementation plan.--
                            (i) In general.--Not later than 60 days 
                        after the date on which a covered platform 
                        receives the notice from the Commission 
                        required under subsection (a)(3), the covered 
                        platform shall submit to the Commission a plan 
                        to implement each content-agnostic intervention 
                        applicable to the covered platform (as 
                        determined by the Commission) in an 
                        appropriately prompt manner. If the covered 
                        platform reasonably believes that any aspect of 
                        an applicable intervention is not technically 
                        feasible for the covered platform to implement, 
                        would substantially change the core 
                        functionality of the covered platform, or would 
                        pose a material privacy or security risk to 
                        consumer data stored, held, used, processed, or 
                        otherwise possessed by such covered platform, 
                        the covered platform shall include in its plan 
                        evidence supporting these beliefs in accordance 
                        with paragraph (2).
                            (ii) Commission determination.--Not later 
                        than 30 days after receiving a covered 
                        platform's plan under clause (i), the 
                        Commission shall determine whether such plan 
                        includes details related to the appropriately 
                        prompt implementation of each content-agnostic 
                        intervention applicable to the covered 
                        platform, except for any aspect of an 
                        intervention for which the Commission 
                        determines the covered platform is exempt under 
                        paragraph (2).
                            (iii) Appeal or revised plan.--
                                    (I) In general.--Subject to 
                                subclause (II), if the Commission 
                                determines under clause (ii) that a 
                                covered platform's plan does not 
                                satisfy the requirements of this 
                                subsection, not later than 90 days 
                                after the issuance of such 
                                determination, the covered platform 
                                shall--
                                            (aa) appeal the 
                                        determination by the Commission 
                                        to the United States Court of 
                                        Appeals for the Federal 
                                        Circuit; or
                                            (bb) submit to the 
                                        Commission a revised plan for a 
                                        Commission determination 
                                        pursuant to clause (ii).
                                    (II) Limitation.--If a covered 
                                platform submits 3 revised plans to the 
                                Commission for a determination pursuant 
                                to clause (ii) and the Commission 
                                determines that none of the revised 
                                plans satisfy the requirements of this 
                                subsection, the Commission may find 
                                that the platform is not acting in good 
                                faith in developing an implementation 
                                plan and may require the platform to 
                                implement, pursuant to a plan developed 
                                for the platform by the Commission, 
                                each content-agnostic intervention 
                                applicable to the platform (as 
                                determined by the Commission) in an 
                                appropriately prompt manner.
                    (B) Statement of compliance.--Not less frequently 
                than annually, each covered platform shall make 
                publicly available on their website and submit to the 
                Commission, in a machine-readable format and in a 
                privacy-preserving manner, the details of--
                            (i) the covered platform's compliance with 
                        the required implementation of content-agnostic 
                        interventions; and
                            (ii) the impact (using the metrics defined 
                        by the Director of the National Science 
                        Foundation and the National Academies of 
                        Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine pursuant to 
                        section 3(a)(6)) of such content-agnostic 
                        interventions on reducing the harms of 
                        algorithmic amplification and social media 
                        addiction on covered platforms.
            (2) Feasibility, functionality, privacy, and security 
        exemptions.--
                    (A) Statement of inapplicability.--Not later than 
                60 days after the date on which a covered platform 
                receives the notice from the Commission required under 
                subsection (a)(3), a covered platform seeking an 
                exemption from any aspect of such rule may submit to 
                the Commission--
                            (i) a statement identifying any specific 
                        aspect of a content-agnostic intervention 
                        applicable to such covered platform (as 
                        determined by the Commission under subsection 
                        (a)) that the covered platform reasonably 
                        believes--
                                    (I) is not technically feasible for 
                                the covered platform to implement;
                                    (II) will substantially change the 
                                core functionality of the covered 
                                platform; or
                                    (III) will create a material and 
                                imminent privacy or security risk to 
                                the consumer data stored, held, used, 
                                processed, or otherwise possessed by 
                                such covered platform; and
                            (ii) specific evidence supporting such 
                        belief, including any relevant information 
                        regarding the core functionality of the covered 
                        platform.
                    (B) Determination by the commission.--Not later 
                than 30 days after receiving a covered platform's 
                statement under subparagraph (A), the Commission shall 
                determine whether the covered platform shall be exempt 
                from any aspect of a content-agnostic intervention 
                discussed in the covered platform's statement.
                    (C) Appeal or revised plan.--Not later than 90 days 
                after a determination issued under subparagraph (B), a 
                covered platform may--
                            (i) appeal the determination by the 
                        Commission to the United States Court of 
                        Appeals for the Federal Circuit; or
                            (ii) submit to the Commission a revised 
                        plan, including details related to the prompt 
                        implementation of any content-agnostic 
                        intervention for which the covered platform 
                        requested an exemption that the Commission 
                        subsequently denied, for a Commission 
                        determination pursuant to paragraph (1)(A)(ii).

SEC. 5. TRANSPARENCY REPORT.

    Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, 
and semiannually thereafter, each covered platform shall publish a 
publicly available, machine-readable report about the content 
moderation efforts of the covered platform with respect to each 
language spoken by not less than 100,000 monthly active users of the 
covered platform in the United States. Such report shall include the 
following:
            (1) Content moderators.--The total number of individuals 
        employed or contracted by the covered platform during the 
        reporting period to engage in content moderation for each 
        language, broken down by the number of individuals retained as 
        full-time employees, part-time employees, and contractors of 
        the covered platform and reported in a privacy-preserving 
        manner.
            (2) Random sample of viewed content.--Information related 
        to a random sample of publicly visible content accounting for 
        1,000 views each month. Each month, covered platforms shall 
        calculate the total number of views for each piece of publicly 
        visible content posted during the month and sample randomly 
        from the content in a manner such that the probability of a 
        piece of content being sampled is proportionate to the total 
        number of views of that piece of content during the month. 
        Covered platforms shall report the following information about 
        each piece of sampled content (with appropriate redactions to 
        exclude the disclosure of illegal content):
                    (A) The text, images, audio, video, or other 
                creative data associated with each such piece of 
                content.
                    (B) The details of the account or accounts that 
                originally posted the content.
                    (C) The total number of views of each such piece of 
                content during the month.
            (3) High reach content.--Content moderation metrics broken 
        down by language to assess the prevalence of harmful content on 
        the covered platform, including, for each language, the 1,000 
        most viewed pieces of publicly visible content each month, 
        including the following (with appropriate redactions to exclude 
        the disclosure of illegal content):
                    (A) The text, images, audio, video, or other 
                creative data associated with each such piece of 
                content.
                    (B) The details of--
                            (i) the account that originally posted the 
                        content; and
                            (ii) any account whose sharing or reposting 
                        of the content accounted for more than 5 
                        percent of the views of the content.
            (4) Removed and moderated content.--
                    (A) In general.--Aggregate metrics for user-
                generated content that is affected by any automated or 
                manual moderation system or decision, including, as 
                calculated on a monthly basis and reported in a 
                privacy-preserving manner, the number of pieces of 
                user-generated content and the number of views of such 
                content that were--
                            (i) reported to the covered platform by a 
                        user of the covered platform;
                            (ii) flagged by the covered platform by an 
                        automated content detection system;
                            (iii) removed from the covered platform and 
                        not restored;
                            (iv) removed from the covered platform and 
                        later restored; or
                            (v) labeled, edited, or otherwise moderated 
                        by the covered platform following a user report 
                        or flagging by an automated content detection 
                        system.
                    (B) Requirements for metrics.--The metrics reported 
                under subparagraph (A) shall be broken down by--
                            (i) the language of the user-generated 
                        content;
                            (ii) the topic of the user-generated 
                        content, such as bullying, hate speech, drugs 
                        and firearms, violence and incitement, or any 
                        other category determined by the covered 
                        platform to categorize such content; and
                            (iii) if the covered platform has a process 
                        for publicly verifying that an account on the 
                        platform belongs to a prominent user or public 
                        figure, whether the creator of the content is a 
                        politician or journalist with a verified 
                        account.

SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Algorithmic amplification.--The term ``algorithmic 
        amplification'' means the promotion, demotion, recommendation, 
        prioritization, or de-prioritization of user-generated content

This bill makes various changes to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) with respect to certain loans, loan applicants, and loan recipients.
First, the bill permits farming partnerships with gross farming income from self-employment to request a recalculation of the amount of their PPP loans based on the partners' distributive shares of gross income from the partnership. The recalculation is available retroactively for loans made on or before the date of enactment of this bill.
Additionally, applicants for PPP loans may calculate their maximum loan amount based on the applicant's Internal Revenue Service Form 1040, Schedule C (i.e., profit or loss from a business). This applies retroactively to PPP loans made or approved on or before December 27, 2020.
The bill also increases the maximum amount of a second draw PPP loan for individuals who received PPP loan forgiveness. The maximum second draw PPP loan amount for an eligible individual includes the increased PPP loan amount the individual would have received under the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act had the individual not already received loan forgiveness. This applies retroactively to second draw loans made on for before the date of enactment of this bill.
The bill changes from a quarterly period to any contiguous 90-day period the calculation of revenue loss in determining eligibility for a second draw PPP loan.
The bill also extends certain dates with respect to the administration of the PPP.","To amend the Small Business Act to modify the maximum paycheck

                it shall be in order to move to proceed to consider the 
                joint resolution in the House. All points of order 
                against the motion are waived. Such a motion shall not 
                be in order after the House has disposed of a motion to 
                proceed on a joint resolution with regard to the same 
                certification. The previous question shall be considered 
                as ordered on the motion to its adoption without 
                intervening motion. The motion shall not be debatable. A

                intervening motion except two hours of debate equally 
                divided and controlled by the sponsor of the joint 
                resolution (or a designee) and an opponent. A motion to 
                reconsider the vote on passage of the joint resolution 
                shall not be in order.
            (5) Consideration in the senate.--
                    (A) Committee referral.--A joint resolution of 
                disapproval introduced in the Senate shall be referred 
                to the Committee on Finance.
                    (B) <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  Reporting and discharge.--
                If the Committee on Finance has not reported such joint 
                resolution of disapproval within 10 days on which the 
                Senate is in session after the date of referral of such 
                joint resolution, that committee shall be discharged

                the Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in order at any 
                time after the Committee on Finance reports the joint 
                resolution of disapproval to the Senate or has been 
                discharged from its consideration (even though a 
                previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed 
                to) to move to proceed to the consideration of the joint 
                resolution, and all points of order against the joint 
                resolution (and against consideration of the joint 
                resolution) shall be waived. The motion to proceed is 
                not debatable. The motion is not subject to a motion to 
                postpone. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the 
                motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in 
                order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of 
                the joint resolution of disapproval is agreed to, the 
                joint resolution shall remain the unfinished business

                10 hours, which shall be divided equally between the 
                majority and minority leaders or their designees. A 
                motion to further limit debate is in order and not 
                debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or 
                a motion to proceed to the consideration of other 
                business, or a motion to recommit the joint resolution 
                of disapproval is not in order.
                    (E) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage shall 
                occur immediately following the conclusion of the debate 
                on the joint resolution of disapproval and a single 
                quorum call at the conclusion of the debate, if 
                requested in accordance with the rules of the Senate.
                    (F) Rules of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from 
                the decisions of the Chair relating to the application 
                of the rules of the Senate, as the case may be, to the 
                procedure

[[Page 136 STAT. 1157]]

                relating to the joint resolution of disapproval shall be 
                decided without debate.
                    (G) Consideration of veto messages.--Debate in the 
                Senate of any veto message with respect to the joint 
                resolution of disapproval, including all debatable 
                motions and appeals in connection with such joint 
                resolution, shall be limited to 10 hours, to be equally 
                divided between, and controlled by, the majority leader 
                and the minority leader or their designees.
            (6) <<NOTE: Applicability.>>  Procedures in the senate.--
        Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the following 
        procedures shall apply in the Senate to a joint resolution of 
        disapproval:
                    (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a joint 
                resolution of disapproval that has passed the House of 
                Representatives shall, when received in the Senate, be 
                referred to the Committee on Finance for consideration 
                in accordance with this subsection.
                    (B) If a joint resolution of disapproval was 
                introduced in the Senate before receipt of a joint 
                resolution of disapproval that has passed the House of 
                Representatives, the joint resolution from the House of 
                Representatives shall, when received in the Senate, be 
                placed on the calendar. If this subparagraph applies, 
                the procedures in the Senate with respect to a joint 
                resolution of disapproval introduced in the Senate that 
                contains the identical matter as the joint resolution of 
                disapproval that passed the House of Representatives 
                shall be the same as if no joint resolution of 
                disapproval had been received from the House of 
                Representatives, except that the vote on passage in the 
                Senate shall be on the joint resolution of disapproval 
                that passed the House of Representatives.
            (7) Rules of the house of representatives and the senate.--
        This subsection is enacted by Congress--
                    (A) <<NOTE: Applicability.>>  as an exercise of the 
                rulemaking power of the Senate and the House of 
                Representatives, respectively, and as such is deemed a 
                part of the rules of each House, respectively, but 
                applicable only with respect to the procedure to be 
                followed in that House in the case of a joint resolution 
                of disapproval, and supersedes other rules only to the 
                extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and
                    (B) with full recognition of the constitutional 
                right of either House to change the rules (so far as 
                relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, in 
                the same

                other rule of that House.

This bill addresses the management and conservation of forage fish.
The Department of Commerce must issue a definition for the term forage fish. It must consider certain factors in defining such term, including whether a species covered by the definition (1) is at a low trophic level; (2) is generally small to intermediate-sized; (3) occurs in schools or other dense aggregations; (4) contributes significantly to the diets of other fish, marine mammals, or birds; and (5) serves as a conduit for energy transfer to species at a higher trophic level.
Commerce must also establish guidelines to assist regional fishery management councils in (1) developing a list of unmanaged forage fish areas and prohibiting the development of any new forage fish fisheries until the potential impacts of such fisheries have been assessed; and (2)	setting annual catch limits for forage fish fisheries that assess, specify, and reduce such limits by the diet needs of other fish species and marine wildlife.
The bill adds shad (American shad and hickory shad)	and river herring (blueback herring and alewife)	to the list of managed stocks for the New England and Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council.","To improve the management of forage fish.

Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.).

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Section 2(a) (16 U.S.C. 1801(a)) is amended by adding at the end 
the following:
            ``(14) Forage fish are generally small to intermediate-
        sized species, occurring in schools or dense aggregations, and 
        function as a main pathway for energy to flow from phyto- and 
        zooplankton to higher trophic level predators, such as tuna, 
        Alaska pollock, and other wildlife, in marine ecosystems. While 
        most species function as prey of others at some life stage, 
        especially when small and young, forage fish maintain this 
        important trophic role throughout their life. Further, 
        fluctuations in their populations can result in significant 
        changes in marine communities and ecosystems. Therefore, 
        particular attention to management of forage fish species, and 
        addressing their unique role in marine ecosystems, is critical 
        to maintaining ecosystem function and sustainable fisheries.''.

SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Attorney General, acting through the Director of the 
National Institute of Justice, shall carry out a study--
            (1) on the underlying factors that contribute to acts of 
        animal cruelty committed by individuals; and
            (2) that analyzes acts of animal cruelty as a predictor of 
        future violence against humans.
    (b) Content of Study.--In carrying out the study under subsection 
(a), the Director of the National Institute of Justice shall--
            (1) specifically examine, through a review of scientific 
        literature, original research, and expert input, as 
        appropriate--
                    (A) evidence-informed risk factors associated or 
                correlated with individuals who commit acts of animal 
                cruelty;
                    (B) whether certain acts of animal cruelty can be 
                correlated with certain evidence-informed risk factors 
                (such as whether the acts of animal torturing, 
                tormenting, mutilation, maiming, poisoning, organized 
                abuse, such as animal fighting, sexual abuse,

                    (E) recommendations of areas in which future 
                research on animal cruelty is needed; and
            (2) develop best practices for--
                    (A) early interventions that prevent acts of animal 
                cruelty; and
                    (B) interventions with individuals who have 
                committed acts of animal cruelty to prevent future acts 
                of violence.
    (c) Recommendations.--The Director of the National Institute of 
Justice shall submit to Congress a report containing the specific 
policy recommendations, based on the study conducted under this 
section, for legislative and regulatory action at the Federal, State, 
and local levels to--
            (1) address the evidence-informed risk factors that may 
        contribute to acts of animal cruelty committed by individuals; 
        and
            (2) develop effective interventions and diversion 
        strategies for both juvenile and non-juvenile offenders who 
        have been convicted of criminal offenses involving animal 
        cruelty that reduce the likelihood of offenders committing 
        future violent acts against both humans and animals.

SEC. 4. STOP FUTURE VIOLENCE GRANT PROGRAM.

to provide personnel, training, technical assistance, data collection, 
and other resources for the apprehension, prosecution, adjudication, 
and mental and behavioral health treatment of persons committing acts 
of animal cruelty, for the rehabilitation of perpetrators and the 
prevention of future acts of animal cruelty or violence against humans, 
and specifically, for the purposes of--
            (1) training law enforcement officers, judges, other court 
        personnel, prosecutors, and mental health professionals to more 
        effectively identify and respond to acts of animal cruelty;
            (2) developing, training, or expanding units of law 
        enforcement officers, judges, other court personnel, 
        prosecutors, and mental health professionals specifically 
        addressing acts of animal cruelty;
            (3) developing and implementing more effective police, 
        court, prosecution, mental health, and early intervention 
        policies, protocols, orders, and services specifically devoted 
        to preventing, identifying, and responding to acts of animal 
        cruelty; and
            (4) developing, installing, or expanding data collection 
        and communication systems, including computerized systems, 
        linking police, prosecutors, and courts, or for the purpose of 
        identifying, classifying, and tracking arrests, protection 
        orders, violations of protection orders, prosecutions, and

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Companion Animal Release from 
Experiments Act of 2021'' or the ``CARE Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress the finds the following:
            (1) The use of animals in research has been an issue of 
        public concern since the mid-20th century, because animals used 
        in research will, in most cases, experience fear, pain, 
        confinement, and premature death.
            (2) Section 495 of the Health Research Extension Act is the 
        statutory basis for the public health service policy of the 
        Federal Government with respect to humane care and use of 
        laboratory animals.
            (3) Currently, the public health service policy of the 
        Surgeon General does not cover the post research treatment of 
        such animals.
            (4) Animals used in research include animals commonly kept 
        as companion animals by the public.
            (5) More than 64,000 dogs, 18,000 cats, and 145,000 rabbits 
        are used in experiments in the United States each year and much 
        of the research is conducted at facilities that receive public 
        funding through the National Institutes of Health.
            (6) Due to an absence of Federal requirements, 12 States 
        have enacted laws governing the post research placement for 
        dogs and cats used in publicly funded research institutions.
            (7) A national requirement is needed to ensure that 
        research institutions that receive tax payer funding establish 
        adoption policies for companion animals that are no longer used 
        for research, including finding such animals a home and 
        adopting transparent policies concerning the success of such 
        requirement.

SEC. 3. OFFERING DOGS, CATS, OR RABBITS USED IN RESEARCH FACILITIES FOR 
              ADOPTION.

    (a) Adoption Guidelines for Research Facilities.--Section 495(b)(3) 
of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 289d(b)(3)) is amended--

            (2) by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (C) 
        and inserting a semicolon; and

    (b) Immunity and Animal Adoption Organization Defined.--Section 495 
of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 289d) is amended by adding 
at the end the following:
    ``(f) Immunity.--A research facility that places a dog, cat, or 
rabbit for adoption consistent with the policies under subsection 
(b)(3)(D) is immune from any civil liability in any Federal or State 
judicial or administrative proceeding arising out of any act or

adoption of such dog, cat, or rabbit, except for willful or wanton 
misconduct.

This bill establishes a new criminal offense for performing or attempting to perform an abortion if the probable post-fertilization age of the fetus is 20 weeks or more.
A violator is subject to criminal penalties—a fine, a prison term of up to five years, or both.
The bill provides exceptions for an abortion (1) that is necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman, or (2) when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. A physician who performs or attempts to perform an abortion under an exception must comply with specified requirements.
A woman who undergoes a prohibited abortion may not be prosecuted for violating or conspiring to violate the provisions of this bill.","To amend title 18, United States Code, to protect pain-capable unborn 
                   children, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection 
Act''.

SEC. 2. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.

    Congress finds and declares the following:
            (1) Pain receptors (nociceptors) are present throughout the 
        unborn child's entire body and nerves link these receptors to 
        the brain's thalamus and subcortical plate by no later than 20 
        weeks after fertilization.
            (2) By 8 weeks after fertilization, the unborn child reacts 
        to touch. After 20 weeks, the unborn child reacts to stimuli 
        that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult 
        human, for example, by recoiling.
            (3) In the unborn child, application of such painful 
        stimuli is associated with significant increases in stress 
        hormones known as the stress response.
            (4) Subjection to such painful stimuli is associated with 
        long-term harmful neurodevelopmental effects, such as altered 
        pain sensitivity and, possibly, emotional, behavioral, and 
        learning disabilities later in life.
            (5) For the purposes of surgery on unborn children, fetal 
        anesthesia is routinely administered and is associated with a 
        decrease in stress hormones compared to their level when 
        painful stimuli are applied without such anesthesia. In the 
        United States, surgery of this type is being performed by 20 
        weeks after fertilization and earlier in specialized units 
        affiliated with children's hospitals.
            (6) The position, asserted by some physicians, that the 
        unborn child is incapable of experiencing pain until a point 
        later in pregnancy than 20 weeks after fertilization 
        predominately rests on the assumption that the ability to 
        experience pain depends on the cerebral cortex and requires 
        nerve connections between the thalamus and the cortex. However, 
        recent medical research and analysis, especially since 2007, 
        provides strong evidence for the conclusion that a functioning 
        cortex is not necessary to experience pain.
            (7) Substantial evidence indicates that children born 
        missing the bulk of the cerebral cortex, those with 
        hydranencephaly, nevertheless experience pain.
            (8) In adult humans and in animals, stimulation or ablation 
        of the cerebral cortex does not alter pain perception, while 
        stimulation or ablation of the thalamus does.
            (9) Substantial evidence indicates that structures used for 
        pain processing in early development differ from those of 
        adults, using different neural elements available at specific 
        times during development, such as the subcortical plate, to 
        fulfill the role of pain processing.
            (10) The position, asserted by some commentators, that the 
        unborn child remains in a coma-like sleep state that precludes 
        the unborn child experiencing pain is inconsistent with the 
        documented reaction of unborn children to painful stimuli and 
        with the experience of fetal surgeons who have found it 
        necessary to sedate the unborn child with anesthesia to prevent 
        the unborn child from engaging in vigorous movement in reaction 
        to invasive surgery.
            (11) Consequently, there is substantial medical evidence 
        that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain at least 
        by 20 weeks after fertilization, if not earlier.
            (12) It is the purpose of the Congress to assert a 
        compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of 
        unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical 
        evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain.
            (13) The compelling governmental interest in protecting the 
        lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial 
        medical evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling 
        pain is intended to be separate from and independent of the 
        compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of 
        unborn children from the stage of viability, and neither 
        governmental interest is intended to replace the other.

        perform or cause to be performed such medical examinations and 
        tests as a reasonably prudent physician, knowledgeable about 
        the case and the medical conditions involved, would consider 
        necessary to make an accurate determination of post-

This bill addresses supporting transportation demand management (TDM) expectations and goals that will serve the mobility needs of the people and freight, foster economic growth and development within and between states and urbanized areas. Transportation demand management is the use of strategies to inform and encourage travelers to maximize the efficiency of a transportation system leading to improved mobility, reduced congestion, and lower vehicle emissions.
Each state and metropolitan planning organization must include TDM targets in the development of their long-range transportation plans.
The bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish a program to encourage and assist the development and funding of TDM related projects.
Additionally, DOT must provide grants to nonprofit institutions of higher education to establish and operate a university transportation center for research and development related to TDM and TDM strategies. TDM strategies means the use of planning, programs, policy, marketing, communications, incentives, pricing, data, and technology to shift travel mode, routes used, departure times, number of trips, and location and design of work spaces or public attractions.
The bill establishes a National Advisory Committee under the Federal Highways Administration to strategically direct federal resources and policies toward implementation of TDM objectives. Additionally, each state must establish advisory committees focused on the development and furthering of the principles of TDM.","To amend title 23, United States Code, to encourage and promote the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stewarding Atlantic Fisheries 
Ecosystems by Supporting Economic Assistance and Sustainability Act of 
2022'' or the ``SAFE SEAS Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The North Atlantic right whale is critically 
        endangered, with estimates suggesting fewer than 350 remain, 
        including fewer than 100 breeding females.
            (2) Harvesters in the North Atlantic have taken previous 
        actions to protect whales, including by implementing weak 
        links, replacing thousands of miles of floating ground line 
        with whale-safe sinking line, and increasing the minimum number 
        of traps per trawl to remove thousands of miles of vertical 
        buoy lines.
            (3) Seventeen North Atlantic right whale mortalities were 
        observed in 2017, including many determined to have been caused 
        by vessel strikes and entanglements, leading to a declaration 
        of a right whale Unusual Mortality Event.
            (4) The Department of Commerce has issued regulations 
        revising the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan under 
        section 229.32 of title 50, Code of Federal Regulations (as in 
        effect on the day before the date of enactment of this Act) 
        that require lobster and Jonah crab harvesters to make gear 
        modifications.
            (5) Implementing the federally required gear modifications, 
        including markings, is estimated to cost the industry tens of 
        millions of dollars per year.
            (6) The fishing industry is a vital driver of regional 
        economies, supporting our coastal communities and stewarding 
        natural resources.

SEC. 3. GRANT ASSISTANCE FOR LOBSTER AND JONAH CRAB HARVESTER GEAR 
              MODIFICATION.

    (a) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to--
            (1) protect the highly endangered North Atlantic right 
        whale population;
            (2) facilitate lobster and Jonah crab harvesters' 
        transition to modified and new gear types in accordance with 
        the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan;
            (3) assist lobster and Jonah crab harvesters with the 
        financial burden of this transition; and
            (4) assist compliance with any subsequent modifications to 
        the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan in any future 
        impacted fisheries.
    (b) Program Authorized.--

        this section as the ``Secretary''), in coordination with the 
        Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, shall provide 
        grants to States from allotments under paragraph (2) to enable 
        the States to assist lobster and Jonah crab harvesters with the 
        costs of gear modifications, including markings, in accordance 
        with the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan.
            (2) Allotments.--

                out this section shall be allotted to each State in 
                proportion to the number of active federally permitted 
                lobster trap harvesters in each State. For purposes of 
                this subparagraph, a federally permitted lobster trap 
                harvester is considered in a State if the Principal 
                Port in the Federal permit application of the lobster 
                trap harvester is in such State.
                    (B) Minimum.--From the total amount available for 
                any fiscal year to carry out this section, each State 
                with not less than 20 active federally permitted 
                lobster trap harvesters shall be allotted not less than 
                4 percent of the total amount.

        at such time, in such manner, and accompanied by such 
        information as the Secretary may require.
            (4) Allowable uses.--A State that receives a grant under 
        this section shall use the grant funds--
                    (A) to assist State-permitted and federally 
                permitted lobster and Jonah crab harvesters with 
                management measures needed to comply with the Atlantic 
                Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, including the costs of 
                federally required gear modification, configuration, 
                and marking within the Northeast lobster and Jonah crab 
                fisheries, including requirements to modify gear 
                marking, change gear configurations to increase traps 
                fished on trawls, or modify buoy lines to accommodate 
                new weak rope and weak insertions;
                    (B) to implement electronic tracking requirements 
                within the American lobster and Jonah crab fishery;
                    (C) to conduct research to inform future management 
                actions, including in preparation for potential 
                subsequent modifications to the Atlantic Large Whale 
                Take Reduction Plan; and
                    (D) to assist fishery compliance with any 
                subsequent modifications to the Atlantic Large Whale 
                Take Reduction Plan, as necessary.
    (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated to carry out this section $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2022 
and such sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal years 2023 and 
2024.

        whale population received protections from such industry in the 
        1930s;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) despite a modest recovery prior to 2010, the

        2010;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) the North Atlantic right whale has been listed

        1531 et seq.) since 1970 and is designated as depleted under 
        the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et 
        seq.);</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) because North Atlantic right whales are long-
        lived and highly migratory, and at present rates females give 
        birth to a single calf only once every 5 to 10 years, they are 
        highly vulnerable to the impacts of human activity and habitat 
        degradation, with female whales and calves particularly 
        vulnerable to vessel strikes;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (6) North Atlantic right whales frequently cross 
        paths with high vessel traffic areas and fishing grounds, 
        leaving the whales particularly vulnerable to vessel collisions 
        and fishing gear entanglements, the leading causes of injury 
        and death to the species;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (7) even when North Atlantic right whales do not 
        die as a result of fishing gear entanglement or vessel strike, 
        those whales can still experience significant sub-lethal 
        effects such as chronic stress and reproductive 
        failure;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (8) this ongoing decline due to human impacts 
        resulted in a further 30 percent decline in the population 
        between 2019 and 2020 resulting in the lowest population 
        estimate in the past 2 decades;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (9) based on the current rate of mortality of 
        North Atlantic right whales, and because of the small number of 
        breeding females in the population and low birth rates, recent 
        analysis suggests the species will lose its ability to recover 
        in merely a few decades if human-caused mortality is not 
        reduced immediately;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (10) under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 
        1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.), United States fishermen in 
        certain locations have been required to modify their fishing 
        gear and behavior to minimize the likelihood of entanglements, 
        including by using sinking groundlines, having weak links in 
        buoy lines, using multiple traps per buoy, appropriately 
        marking fishing gear, and complying with seasonal area-specific 
        closures in North Atlantic right whale habitats;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (11) vessels in United States waters that are 65 
        feet or more in length have been required to comply with a 
        seasonal 10-knot speed limit in certain locations to reduce the 
        threat of vessel collisions; and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (12) ongoing mortalities, driven in part by shifts 
        in North Atlantic right whale distribution caused by climate 
        change, indicate that additional actions are necessary to 
        reverse this species' population decline.</DELETED>
<DELETED>    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) the Governments of the United States and 
        Canada must work together to reduce lethal and sub-lethal 
        effects of human activities on North Atlantic right whales; 
        and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) effectively addressing the threats to the 
        long-term viability of the North Atlantic right whales will 
        require a joint commitment and effort from government entities, 
        local communities, marine scientists and conservationists, 
        fishermen, owners and operators of commercial and recreational 
        vessels and others in the boating and shipping industries, and 
        other stakeholders.</DELETED>

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Future of Agricultural Resiliency 
And Modernization Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The evidence for human-induced climate change is 
        undeniable and our agricultural communities are increasingly 
        experiencing the impacts of climate change.
            (2) The volatility of weather patterns, ranging from more 
        frequent and severe droughts, floods, and wildfires can 
        negatively impact agricultural productivity.
            (3) Rural communities, that often lack Federal and State 
        resources, are especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate 
        change, such as revenue losses, hours lost at work, and 
        infrastructure damages.
            (4) Climate resilient practices and technologies are needed 
        to help save Federal, State, and local taxpayers money. These 
        technologies include manure resource recovery systems, which 
        recover the nutrients contained in organic matter from their 
        source help protect water quality.
            (5) The need for measures that promote energy and water use 
        efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy will greatly 
        reduce the adverse impacts of climate change.
            (6) Many farmers and agricultural producers are currently 
        utilizing environmentally beneficial practices that also better 
        their production costs.
            (7) Excessive heat exposure poses a direct threat to farm 
        workers and the economy. Climate change increases this danger, 
        as 18 of the 19 hottest years on record have occurred since 
        2001. Rising temperatures are projected to cause an increase in 
        heat-related workplace injuries, illnesses, loss in labor 
        capacity, and decreased productivity. In light of these 
        findings, the Federal Government has an obligation to protect 
        farmworkers, outdoor workers, and employers in the United 
        States from climate change.
            (8) The Department of Agriculture should use research and 
        development programs to make dairy digesters more affordable 
        while mitigating environmental effects. Further, the Department 
        should provide technical assistance, community support, and 
        financial incentives and grants for farmers to partner together 
        to build cooperative digester models. The Department should use 
        cross-agency collaborative models and utilize existing Federal 
        programs, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's AgSTAR 
        program to increase farmer access and engagement in these 
        efforts.
            (9) The Department should engage in partnerships with other 
        Federal agencies to control invasive species, in a manner that 
        protects the environment, infrastructure, and agricultural 
        lands in the United States.
            (10) Federal assistance is needed to help farming practices 
        become more resilient and sustainable for the long-term.

SEC. 3. FUTURE OF AGRICULTURAL RESILIENCY AND MODERNIZATION FUND.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Defending Against Imitations and 
Replacements of Yogurt, Milk, and Cheese To Promote Regular Intake of 
Dairy Everyday Act'' or the ``DAIRY PRIDE Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Dairy products are an important part of a healthy diet 
        for both children and adults, according to the Dietary 
        Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 (referred to in this 
        section as the ``Dietary Guidelines'') published by the 
        Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and 
        Human Services. The Dietary Guidelines state that most 
        Americans are not meeting recommended intake for the dairy food 
        group.
            (2) Consumption of dairy foods provides numerous health 
        benefits, including lowering the risk of diabetes, metabolic 
        syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and obesity.
            (3) The Dietary Guidelines state that dairy foods are 
        sources of critical nutrients for human health, including 
        vitamin D, calcium, and potassium, all of which are under 
        consumed by people of the United States. Even though average 
        consumption falls short of amounts recommended by the Food 
        Patterns of the Department of Agriculture, on average across 
        the calorie levels dairy foods still contribute about 68 
        percent of calcium, 76 percent of vitamin D, and 31 percent of 
        magnesium.
            (4) Beginning at age 9 and persisting throughout every 
        subsequent life-stage, individuals in the United States on 
        average fail to meet the recommended amount of dairy intake for 
        their age group, according to the Dietary Guidelines. The 
        Dietary Guidelines note the gap between recommended and current 
        intake of dairy widens throughout life stages and find the age-
        related decreasing intake of dairy for youth ages 2 through 18 
        to be ``notable and concerning''. Overall, approximately 90 
        percent of the entire population of the United States does not 
        meet the daily dairy intake recommendation.
            (5) The Dietary Guidelines state that the nutrient 
        composition of dairy foods highlights the importance of 
        adequate consumption, finding this to be especially relevant 
        for the intake of calcium and vitamin D throughout an 
        individual's life. The Dietary Guidelines note that calcium and 
        vitamin D are important at any age, that adolescents have an 
        increased need for these nutrients to support accrual of bone 
        mass, and that adults should give particular attention to 
        consuming adequate amounts of foods with these nutrients to 
        promote optimal bone health and prevent the onset of 
        osteoporosis. Yet, close to 30 percent of men and 60 percent of 
        women older than age 19 do not consume enough calcium, and more 
        than 90 percent do not consume enough vitamin D. According to 
        the Dietary Guidelines, dietary patterns that do not meet 
        recommended consumption amounts for food groups and subgroups 
        which include sources of calcium and vitamin D, such as dairy 
        foods, contribute to low intake of these nutrients.
            (6) The Dietary Guidelines state that many products sold as 
        ``milks'' but made from plants (e.g., almond, rice, coconut, 
        oat, and hemp ``milks'') do not have an overall nutritional 
        content similar to real milk and that most have significantly 
        less protein than real milk and are not always fortified with 
        calcium and vitamin D. The amount of calcium per calorie is 
        lower for most plant-based alternative milk products. To obtain 
        the amount of calcium contained in one cup of nonfat fluid milk 
        from a plant-based milk alternative, the portion size and 
        calorie intake must be greater.
            (7) Similarly, imitation dairy products, such as plant-
        based products derived from rice, nuts, hemp, coconut, algae, 
        and other foods that imitate milk, yogurt, and cheese, often do 
        not provide the same nutrition content as real cheese and 
        yogurt derived from dairy cows.
            (8) Plant-based products labeled as milk are misleading to 
        consumers.
            (9) The Food and Drug Administration has regulations that 
        define milk and cream as the ``lacteal secretion, practically 
        free from colostrum, obtained by the complete milking of one or 
        more healthy cows'' (section 131.110 of title 21, Code of 
        Federal Regulations). This definition further applies to milk 
        used to create other dairy products, including yogurt and 
        cheese, as specified in sections 131 and 133 of title 21, Code 
        of Federal Regulations.
            (10) Given the proliferation of plant-based products in the 
        marketplace that are mislabeled as milk despite the standard of 
        identity defined for this substance, enforcement by the Food 
        and Drug Administration against these practices should be 
        improved to avoid misleading consumers.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    No food may be introduced or delivered for introduction into 
interstate commerce using a market name for a dairy product if the food 
does not meet the criterion set forth for dairy products under 
paragraph (z)(2) of section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (21 U.S.C. 343) (as added by section 4(a)).

SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT OF DEFINITION.

    (a) In General.--Section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343) is amended by adding at the end the 
following:
    ``(z)(1) If it uses a market name for a dairy product described in 
subparagraph (3) and the food does not meet the criterion for being a 
dairy product, as described in subparagraph (2).
    ``(2) For purposes of this paragraph, a food is a dairy product 
only if the food is, contains as a primary ingredient, or is derived 
from, the lacteal secretion, practically free from colostrum, obtained 
by the complete milking of one or more hooved mammals.
    ``(3) A market name for a dairy product described in this 
subparagraph means the dairy product terms described in parts 131 and 
133 of subchapter B of chapter I of title 21, Code of Federal 
Regulations, and sections 135.110, 135.115, and 135.140 of title 21, 
Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations), or any 
other term for which the Secretary has promulgated a standard of 
identity with respect to a food that is formulated with a dairy product 
(as described in subparagraph (2)) as the primary ingredient.''.
    (b) Guidance.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting 
through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall--
            (1) not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, issue draft guidance on how enforcement of the 
        amendment made by subsection (a) will be carried out; and
            (2) not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, issue final guidance on such enforcement.
    (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 2 years after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, 
acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall report to 
Congress on enforcement actions taken under paragraph (z) of section 
403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343), as 
amended by this Act, including warnings issued pursuant to such 
paragraph and penalties assessed under section 303 of such Act (21 
U.S.C. 333) with respect to such paragraph. If food that is misbranded 
under section 403(z) is offered for sale in interstate commerce at the 
time of such report, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall include 
in such report an updated plan for enforcement with respect to such 
food.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Subsidizing Childhood Obesity 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and 
        tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years. Currently, more 
        than one-third of children and adolescents are overweight or 
        obese.
            (2) A report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found 
        that if the population of the United States continues on its 
        current trajectory, adult obesity rates could exceed 60 percent 
        in a number of States by 2030.
            (3) Health-related behaviors, such as eating habits and 
        physical activity patterns, develop early in life and often 
        extend into adulthood. The diets of American children and 
        adolescents depart substantially from recommended patterns that 
        put their health at risk. Overall, American children and youth 
        are not achieving basic nutritional goals. They are consuming 
        excess calories and added sugars and have higher than 
        recommended intakes of sodium, total fat, and saturated fats.
            (4) According to a 2012 report from the Federal Trade 
        Commission, the total amount spent on food marketing to 
        children is about $2,000,000,000 a year.
            (5) Companies market food to children through television, 
        radio, internet, magazines, product placement in movies and 
        video games, schools, product packages, toys, clothing and 
        other merchandise, and almost anywhere a logo or product image 
        can be shown.
            (6) According to a comprehensive review by the National 
        Academy of Medicine, studies demonstrate that television food 
        advertising affects children's food choices, food purchase 
        requests, diets, and health.
            (7) A 2005 report from the National Academy of Medicine 
        confirmed that marketing of high-calorie foods to children and 
        adolescents has been identified as one of the major 
        contributors to childhood obesity.
            (8) Nearly three-quarters of the foods advertised on 
        television shows intended for children are for sweets and 
        convenience or fast foods.

              PROMOTE FOOD OF POOR NUTRITIONAL QUALITY.

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Food before Fuel Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Ukraine accounts for 16 percent of global corn exports 
        and 12 percent of wheat exports.
            (2) The United States could more than compensate for the 
        loss of Ukraine's exports by diverting crops that are to be 
        made into biofuels into food production instead.
            (3) Almost 70 percent of all United States grain production 
        is corn, but almost half is formulated into ethanol to drive 
        cars and trucks.
            (4) Converting corn into fuel happens only because of a 
        mass of Federal regulations and subsidies that began during the 
        Carter administration.
            (5) While ethanol may have small environmental advantages 
        over gasoline, the benefits are nullified by ethanol's toll on 
        world food output.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Federal Government should not be incentivizing farmers to grow corn for 
ethanol while Russia's invasion of Ukraine is jeopardizing the lives of 
Ukraine's citizens and is on track to cause a severe malnutrition 
across the world. As this supply is cut off, food prices which are 
already at record levels, will increase at a time when the economic 
fallout from the pandemic is already harming household budgets, 
particularly in low-income countries.

SEC. 3. ELIMINATION OF CORN ETHANOL MANDATE FOR RENEWABLE FUEL.

    (a) Removal of Table.--Section 211(o)(2)(B)(i) of the Clean Air Act 
(42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(2)(B)(i)) is amended by striking subclause (I).
    (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 211(o)(2)(B) of the Clean Air 
Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(2)(B)) is amended--
            (1) in clause (i)--

                as subclauses (I) through (III), respectively;

and investigations. The Secretary shall inspect each research facility 
and the premises of each dealer, and each exhibitor, including any 
properties, animals, facilities, vehicles, equipments or other premises 
used or intended for use in an activity subject to regulation under 
this Act, at least once each year and, in the case of any violation of 
this Act, shall conduct such follow-up inspections as may be necessary 
until all such violations are corrected.
    ``(4)(A) The Secretary shall promulgate such rules and regulations 
necessary to require inspectors to confiscate or destroy in a humane 
manner any animal described in subparagraph (B). Such confiscation 
shall occur promptly upon discovery during an inspection or 
investigation conducted pursuant to this section of an animal meeting 
the criteria specified in clause (i) of such subparagraph. Any dealer, 
exhibitor, intermediate handler, or carrier that has been notified of 
the intent of an inspector to confiscate such an animal shall be 
prohibited from destroying that animal, in any manner, and until the 
Secretary has completed that confiscation, shall be prohibited from 
destroying any other animal in their ownership or possession, without 
prior written consent to do so from the Secretary.
    ``(B) An animal described in this subparagraph is an animal that 
is--
            ``(i) found during an inspection or investigation conducted

be subject to a civil penalty by the Secretary of not more than $10,000 
for each such violation, and the Secretary shall also make an order 
that such person shall cease and desist from continuing such violation. 
Each violation and each day during which a violation continues shall be 
a separate offense.
    ``(2) Verified delivery of an inspection report prepared pursuant 
to section 16 shall serve as notice for purposes of this section. No 
penalty shall be assessed or cease and desist order issued unless such 
person is given notice and opportunity to be heard with respect to the 
alleged violation, and the order of the Secretary assessing a penalty 
and making a cease and desist order shall be final and conclusive 
unless the affected person files an appeal from the Secretary's order 
with the appropriate United States Court of Appeals.
    ``(3) A hearing under this section shall be conducted by, at 
minimum, one veterinarian, and two additional animal care specialists 
or directors. A hearing under this section shall take place within 21 
days after notice of the violation has been delivered unless the 
Secretary identifies a reasonable basis for continuance.
    ``(4) The Secretary shall give due consideration to the 
appropriateness of the penalty with respect to the size of the business 
of the person involved, the gravity of the violation, the person's good 
faith, and the history of previous violations. Any such penalty shall 
be calculated on a per animal and per violation basis and may not be 
reduced by 10 percent or more. The Secretary shall designate a 
responsible party within the Department of Agriculture to establish 
penalty guidelines for violations and to verify that the Department 
adheres to such guidelines. Such guidelines shall be established in a 
manner to reasonably discourage future violations.
    ``(5) Upon any failure to pay the penalty assessed by a final order 
under this section, the Secretary shall request the Attorney General to 
institute a civil action in a district court of the United States or 
other United States court for any district in which such person is 
found or resides or transacts business, to collect the penalty, and 
such court shall have jurisdiction to hear and decide any such action. 
Any person who knowingly fails to obey a cease and desist order made by 
the Secretary under this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of 
$1,500.''.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Medical Marijuana Safe 
Harbor Act.''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Chronic pain affects the veteran population, with 
        almost 60 percent of veterans returning from serving in the 
        Armed Forces in the Middle East, and more than 50 percent of 
        older veterans, who are using the health care system of the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs living with some form of chronic 
        pain.
            (2) In 2018, opioids accounted for approximately 70 percent 
        of all drug overdose deaths in the United States.
            (3) Veterans are twice as likely to die from opioid related 
        overdoses than nonveterans.
            (4) States with medical cannabis laws have a 24.8 percent 
        lower mean annual opioid overdose mortality rate compared with 
        States without medical cannabis laws.
            (5) Marijuana and its compounds show promise for treating a 
        wide-range of diseases and disorders, including pain 
        management.
            (6) Medical marijuana in States where it is legal may serve 
        as a less harmful alternative to opioids in treating veterans.

        dispensation, administration, delivery, and transport of 
        medical marijuana; or
            (3) a physician to recommend, complete forms for, or

SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 6 USC 242a note.>>  SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the victim-centered approach must become universally 
        understood, adopted, and practiced;
            (2) criminal justice efforts must increase the focus on, and 
        adeptness at, investigating and prosecuting forced labor cases;
            (3) corporations must eradicate forced labor from their 
        supply chains;
            (4) the Department of Homeland Security must lead by 
        example--
                    (A) by ensuring that its government supply chain of 
                contracts and procurement are not tainted by forced 
                labor; and
                    (B) by leveraging all of its authorities against the 
                importation of goods produced with forced labor; and
            (5) human trafficking training, awareness, identification, 
        and screening efforts--
                    (A) are a necessary first step for prevention, 
                protection, and enforcement; and
                    (B) should be evidence-based to be most effective.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act of 
2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Sharks are critically important species for their 
        economic, cultural, and ecosystem value.
            (2) Many shark populations are in peril worldwide and are 
        on the decline.
            (3) One of the greatest threats to sharks is the global 
        trade in shark fins. It is estimated that fins from as many as 
        73,000,000 sharks end up in the global shark fin trade every 
        year.
            (4) Shark fins have no medicinal or nutritional value.
            (5) The trade in shark fins is primarily focused on large 
        coastal and pelagic species that grow slowly, mature late, and 
        have low reproduction rates.
            (6) Shark fins are often removed and retained while the 
        remainder of a shark is discarded due to the high market value 
        of shark fins relative to other parts of a shark.
            (7) Shark fins are removed primarily to be commercialized 
        as a fungible commodity.
            (8) Shark finning is the cruel practice in which the fins 
        of a shark are cut off on board a fishing vessel at sea. The 
        remainder of the animal is then thrown back into the water to 
        drown, starve, or die a slow death.
            (9) Although the United States has banned the practice of 
        shark finning aboard vessels in waters controlled by the United 
        States, there is no Federal ban on the removal and sale of 
        shark fins once the fin is brought ashore.
            (10) Once a shark fin is detached from the body, it becomes 
        impossible to determine whether the shark was legally caught or 
        the fin lawfully removed.
            (11) It is difficult to determine which species of shark a 
        fin was removed from, which is problematic because some species 
        are threatened with extinction.
            (12) The States of Texas, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, 
        Massachusetts, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, 
        California, Nevada, and Washington and American Samoa, Guam, 
        and the North Mariana Islands have implemented bans on the sale 
        of shark fins.
            (13) Shark fins possessed, transported, offered for sale, 
        sold, or purchased anywhere in the United States are part of a 
        large international market, having a substantial and direct 
        effect on interstate commerce.
            (14) Abolition of the shark fin trade in the United States 
        will remove the United States from the global shark fin market 
        and will put the United States in a stronger position to 
        advocate internationally for abolishing the shark fin trade in 
        other countries.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON SALE OF SHARK FINS.

    (a) Prohibition.--Except as provided in section 4, no person shall 
possess, transport, offer for sale, sell, or purchase shark fins or 
products containing shark fins.
    (b) Penalty.--A violation of subsection (a) shall be treated as an 
act prohibited by section 307 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1857) and shall be penalized 
pursuant to section 308(a) of that Act (16 U.S.C. 1858(a)), except that 
the maximum civil penalty for each violation shall be $100,000, or the 
fair market value of the shark fins involved, whichever is greater.

SEC. 4. EXCEPTIONS.

    A person may possess a shark fin that was taken lawfully under a 
State, territorial, or Federal license or permit to take or land 
sharks, if the shark fin is separated from the shark in a manner 
consistent with the license or permit and is--
            (1) destroyed or discarded upon separation;
            (2) used for noncommercial subsistence purposes in 
        accordance with State or territorial law;
            (3) used solely for display or research purposes by a 
        museum, college, or university, or other person under a State 
        or Federal permit to conduct noncommercial scientific research; 
        or
            (4) retained by the license or permit holder for a 
        noncommercial purpose.

SEC. 5. DOGFISH.

    (a) In General.--It shall not be a violation of section 3 for any 
person to possess, transport, offer for sale, sell, or purchase any 
fresh or frozen raw fin or tail from any stock of the species Mustelus 
canis (smooth dogfish) or Squalus acanthias (spiny dogfish).
    (b) Report.--By not later than January 1, 2027, the Secretary of 
Commerce shall review the exemption contained in subsection (a) and 
shall prepare and submit to Congress a report that includes a 
recommendation on whether the exemption contained in subsection (a) 
should continue or be terminated. In preparing such report and making 
such recommendation, the Secretary shall analyze factors including--
            (1) the economic viability of dogfish fisheries with and 
        without the continuation of the exemption;
            (2) the impact to ocean ecosystems of continuing or 
        terminating the exemption;
            (3) the impact on enforcement of the ban contained in 
        section 3 caused by the exemption; and
            (4) the impact of the exemption on shark conservation.

SEC. 6. DEFINITION OF SHARK FIN.

    In this Act, the term ``shark fin'' means--
            (1) the raw or dried or otherwise processed detached fin of 
        a shark; or
            (2) the raw or dried or otherwise processed detached tail 
        of a shark.

SEC. 7. STATE AUTHORITY.

    Nothing in this Act may be construed to preclude, deny, or limit 
any right of a State or territory to adopt or enforce any regulation or 
standard that is more stringent than a regulation or standard in effect 
under this Act.

SEC. 8. SEVERABILITY.

    If any provision of this Act or its application to any person or 
circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other 
provisions or applications of this Act which can be given effect 
without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the 
provisions of this Act are severable.

3893,8604,H.R.1258,Agriculture and Food,"Strengthening Local Processing Act of 2021
This bill revises provisions related to meat and poultry processing establishments, including smaller establishments (i.e., those with between 10 and 500 employees) and very small establishments (i.e., those with fewer than 10 employees or annual sales of less than $2.5 million).
For example, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) must establish a searchable database of peer-reviewed validation studies for use in developing Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points plans for smaller and very small establishments.
The bill increases the maximum federal cost share from 50% to 65% that USDA may provide to assist states in creating meat and poultry inspection programs.
Additionally, USDA must conduct outreach with states that have meat and poultry inspection programs, but that do not have Cooperative Interstate Shipment programs. The Cooperative Interstate Shipment program allows state-inspected facilities to operate as federally-inspected facilities and ship their products in interstate commerce and internationally.
USDA must also award competitive grants for activities to adapt production, processing, distribution, and sales systems to respond to and recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including activities that support (1) the health and safety of meat and poultry plant employees, suppliers, and customers; (2) increased processing capacity; and (3) the resilience of the small meat and poultry processing sector.
Further, the bill establishes grant programs to (1) establish or expand career training programs at community colleges, vocational schools, and universities related to meat and poultry processing; and (2) support smaller and very small establishments by offsetting the cost of training new meat and poultry processors.","To amend the Poultry Products Inspection Act and the Federal Meat

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Humane Research and Testing Act of 
2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
        is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior 
        of living systems and the application of that knowledge to 
        enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and 
        disability.
            (2) Much of NIH's research is carried out on animals. 
        However, the precise number of animals used in research in the 
        United States is unknown. Estimates range between 17 million 
        and 100 million animals used annually. Such imprecise numbers 
        make it impossible to effectively track and reduce the numbers 
        of animals used, as mandated by the NIH policies to ensure the 
        smallest possible number of animals are used.
            (3) There is widespread agreement among scientists and 
        regulatory agencies that animal models are poor predictors of 
        the human response, with over 90 percent of new candidate drugs 
        never making it to market.
            (4) More than 30 percent of promising medications have 
        failed in human clinical trials because they are found to be 
        toxic despite promising pre-clinical studies in animal models. 
        An additional 65 percent of candidate drugs that pass animal 
        trials fail due to lack of efficacy.
            (5) Despite the ever-increasing growth in animal 
        procedures, there is no corresponding increase in the number of 
        human medicines making it to the clinic.
            (6) Dramatically rising costs and extremely high failure 
        rates in drug development have led many to re-evaluate the 
        value of animal studies.
            (7) Effective alternatives to animals are available and 
        growing. Cutting-edge technology has forged new frontiers in 
        biology and medicine that have produced human-relevant models, 
        including organoid cell cultures, organs-on-chips, genomics, 
        induced pluripotent adult stem cells, 3D modeling with human 
        cells, high throughput technology, molecular imaging, computer 
        models, in silico trials, digital imaging, artificial 
        intelligence, and other innovative methods--all of which have 
        launched a technological revolution in biomedical research.
            (8) Despite these cutting-edge, human-relevant methods, a 
        preponderance of NIH research is carried out on animals. A 2019 
        news release from NIH indicates that 70 percent of NIH grant 
        applications relate to studies using mice.
            (9) The American public has expressed concern about 
        subjecting animals to the pain of experimentation. This concern 
        grows as alternatives to research on animals become available.
            (10) Under the system of oversight established by the 
        National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 
        (Public Law 103-43), NIH is supposed to outline a plan for 
        reducing the use of animals in research. Section 404C(a)(1) of 
        the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 283e(a)(1)), as added 
        by section 205 of the National Institutes of Health 
        Revitalization Act of 1993, calls for NIH to ``conduct or 
        support research into . . . methods of biomedical research and 
        experimentation that do not require the use of animals and 
        methods of such research and experimentation that reduce the 
        number of animals used in such research''.
            (11) A dedicated center that provides resources, funding, 
        and training to encourage researchers to utilize humane, cost-
        effective, and scientifically suitable non-animal methods is 
        needed to fulfill the intent of the National Institutes of 
        Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-43).

SEC. 3. NATIONAL CENTER FOR ALTERNATIVES TO ANIMALS IN RESEARCH AND 
              TESTING.

    (a) Addition to List of Institutes and Centers.--Section 401 of the 
Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 281) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating paragraph (25) as paragraph (26); and
            (2) by inserting after paragraph (24) the following new 
        paragraph:
            ``(25) National Center for Alternatives to Animals in 
        Research and Testing.''.
    (b) Conforming Change to Number of Institutes and Centers.--Section 
401(d)(1) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 281(d)(1)) is 
amended by striking ``27'' and inserting ``28''.
    (c) Establishment; Duties.--Part E of title IV of the Public Health 
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 287 et seq.) is amended by inserting after 
subpart 5 of such part E (42 U.S.C. 287c-21) the following new subpart:

 ``Subpart 6--National Center for Alternatives to Animals in Research 
                              and Testing

This bill establishes measures to address global public health risks posed by wildlife markets, which are commercial markets that sell or slaughter wildlife for human consumption as food or medicine in communities where alternative nutritional or protein sources are available.
Specifically, the bill prohibits importing, exporting, purchasing, or selling live wild animals in the United States for human consumption as food or medicine. The Department of the Interior must hire, train, and deploy at least 50 new U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service law enforcement attachés around the world, and the U.S. Agency for International Development must increase specified activities to address the threats and causes of zoonotic (animal-to-human transmission) disease outbreaks. Additionally, the United States must work with other United Nations member states to urge a global ban on commercial wildlife markets and enforcement of laws to end wildlife trafficking.
Further, the President may impose sanctions against a foreign country or foreign nationals that the Department of State has determined are taking certain actions that enable or facilitate commercial wildlife markets.
Among other reports required by the bill, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine must conduct a study and submit a report that includes an evaluation of (1) the impact that consumption of terrestrial wildlife as food or medicine has on the transmission of novel viral and other pathogens, (2) the role of consuming terrestrial wildlife as food or medicine in the transmission of microbes from animals to humans, and (3) the conditions at live wildlife markets that lead to this transmission.","To address the public health risks posed by wildlife markets, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Preventing Future Pandemics Act of 
2021''.

SEC. 2. WILDLIFE MARKET DEFINED.

    In this Act, the term ``wildlife market''--
            (1) means a commercial market that--
                    (A) sells or slaughters terrestrial, including 
                avian, wildlife for human consumption as food or 
                medicine, whether the animals originated in the wild or 
                in a captive environment; and
                    (B) delivers a product in communities where 
                alternative nutritional or protein sources are 
                available; and
            (2) does not include markets in areas where no other 
        practical alternative sources of protein or meat exists, such 
        as wildlife markets in rural areas on which indigenous people 
        rely to feed themselves and their families.

SEC. 3. STUDY ON RISK OF WILDLIFE MARKETS ON THE EMERGENCE OF NOVEL 
              VIRAL PATHOGENS.

    Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall seek to enter into an 
agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and 
Medicine under which the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, 
and Medicine agrees to--
            (1) conduct a study to evaluate--
                    (A) the impact of physical proximity and 
                consumption of terrestrial wildlife as food or medicine 
                on the emergence of viral and other microbial 
                pathogens;
                    (B) the impact of consumption of terrestrial 
                wildlife as food or medicine on the transmission of 
                novel viral and other microbial pathogens;
                    (C) the role consumption of terrestrial wildlife as 
                food or medicine has on the transmission of microbes 
                from animals to humans; and
                    (D) the conditions at live wildlife markets that 
                lead to transmission of zoonotic diseases; and
            (2) not later than one year after the date of such 
        agreement, submit a report to the Committee on Health, 
        Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the Committee 
        on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives on the 
        findings of the study described in paragraph (1).

SEC. 4. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that global 
institutions, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), 
and the World Health Organization (WHO), together with leading 
nongovernmental organizations, veterinary colleges, and the United 
States Agency for International Development (USAID), should promote the 
paradigm of One Health--the integration of human health, animal health, 
agriculture, ecosystems, and the environment as an effective and 
integrated way to address the complexity of emerging disease threats.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to 
facilitate international cooperation by working with international 
partners and through intergovernmental, international, and 
nongovernmental organizations such as the United Nations to--
            (1) lead a resolution at the United Nations Security 
        Council or General Assembly and World Health Assembly outlining 
        the danger to human and animal health from emerging zoonotic 
        infectious diseases, with recommendations for implementing the 
        worldwide closure of wildlife markets and the ending of the 
        associated commercial trade of terrestrial wildlife that feed 
        and supply those markets, except for in such countries or 
        regions where the consumption of wildlife is necessary for 
        local food security or where such actions would significantly 
        disrupt a readily available and irreplaceable food supply;
            (2) work with governments through existing treaties and the 
        United Nations to develop a new protocol or agreement, and 
        amend existing protocols or agreements, regarding stopping 
        deforestation and other ecosystem destruction, closing 
        commercial wildlife markets for human consumption, and end the 
        associated commercial trade of terrestrial wildlife that feed 
        and supply those markets while ensuring full consideration to 
        the needs and rights of indigenous peoples and local 
        communities that are dependent on wildlife for their food 
        security, national sovereignty, and local laws and customs;
            (3) disrupt and ultimately end the commercial international 
        trade in terrestrial wildlife associated with wildlife markets 
        and eliminate commercial wildlife markets;
            (4) disrupt and ultimately eliminate wildlife trafficking 
        associated with the operation of wildlife markets;
            (5) raise awareness on the dangerous potential of wildlife 
        markets as a source of zoonotic diseases such as the novel 
        coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19 and reduce demand 
        for the consumption of wildlife through evidence-based behavior 
        change programs while ensuring that existing wildlife habitat 
        is not encroached upon or destroyed as part of this process;
            (6) encourage and support alternate forms of food 
        production, farming, and shifts to domestic animal- or plant-
        source foods instead of terrestrial wildlife where able and 
        appropriate, and reduce consumer demand for terrestrial 
        wildlife through enhanced local and national food systems, 
        especially in areas where wildlife markets play a significant 
        role in meeting subsistence needs while ensuring that existing 
        wildlife habitat is not encroached upon or destroyed as part of 
        this process; and
            (7) strive to increase hygienic standards implemented in 
        markets around the globe, especially those specializing in the 
        sale of products intended for human consumption.
    (c) Activities.--
            (1) Global prohibitions and enforcement.--The United States 
        Government, working through the United Nations and its 
        components, as well as international organization such as 
        Interpol and the World Organisation for Animal Health, and in 
        furtherance of the policies described in subsection (b), 
        shall--
                    (A) collaboratively with other member states, issue 
                declarations, statements, and communiques urging a 
                global ban on commercial wildlife markets and trade for 
                human consumption; and
                    (B) urge increased enforcement of existing laws to 
                end wildlife trafficking.
            (2) International coalitions.--The Secretary of State shall 
        seek to build international coalitions focused on ending 
        commercial wildlife markets for human consumption and 
        associated wildlife trade which feeds and supplies said 
        markets, with a focus on the following efforts:
                    (A) Providing assistance and advice to other 
                governments in the adoption of legislation and 
                regulations to close wildlife markets and trade for 
                human consumption.
                    (B) Creating economic pressure on wildlife markets 
                and their supply chains to prevent their operation.
                    (C) Providing assistance and guidance to other 
                governments to prohibit the import, export, and 
                domestic trade of live terrestrial wildlife for the 
                purpose of human consumption.
                    (D) Engaging and receiving guidance from key 
                stakeholders at the ministerial, local government, and 
                civil society level in countries that will be impacted 
                by this Act and where wildlife markets and associated 
                wildlife trafficking is the predominant source of meat 
                or protein, in order to mitigate the impact of any 
                international efforts on local customs, conservation 
                methods, or cultural norms.
            (3) Authorization of imposition of sanctions.--

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Earth Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Global climate change is an immediate threat to the 
        national security, public health, and national economy of the 
        United States as well as the legacy we will leave to our 
        children.
            (2) The most vulnerable communities, including communities 
        of color, women, children, the elderly, persons with 
        disabilities, low-income communities, and those with underlying 
        health conditions, face even greater health risks as a result 
        of climate change.
            (3) The United States is already seeing climate change 
        exacerbate extreme weather events, with--
                    (A) the year 2020 seeing the most active Atlantic 
                hurricane season on record with 30 named storms and six 
                major hurricanes;
                    (B) the 2019 issuance of the first-ever Extreme Red 
                Flag Warning for wildfires;
                    (C) hundreds of thousands of acres in the Western 
                United States currently or recently experiencing 
                devastating wildfires; and
                    (D) communities around the country regularly facing 
                ``100-Year Floods''.
            (4) The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
        Change 2016 Special Report on Climate Change and Land found 
        that sustainable land management can contribute to reducing the 
        negative impacts of multiple stressors, including climate 
        change.
            (5) The Environmental Protection Agency found that 
        electricity, transportation, and agriculture accounted for more 
        than 60 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in 2019.
            (6) The National Centers for Environmental Information 
        found that, in 2021, there were 20 weather and climate disaster 
        events with losses exceeding $1,000,000,000 each to affect the 
        United States. These events resulted in the deaths of 688 
        people and had significant economic effects on the areas 
        impacted. The 1980-2021 annual average is 7.4 events.
            (7) The total cost of United States billion-dollar 
        disasters over the years 2016 through 2020 exceeds 
        $600,000,000,000, with a 5-year annual cost average of 
        $121,300,000,000.
            (8) The IPCC released its Working Group I, 2021 report, 
        which found that, unless immediate and broad reductions in 
        greenhouse gas emissions are made by the international 
        community, it will be impossible to limit global warming to 2 
        degrees Celsius, the warming level which the scientific 
        community believes will precipitate catastrophic climate-
        related consequences and risks to human health, livelihoods, 
        food security, human security, water supply, and economic 
        growth will all increase.
            (9) In 2021, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, 
        expressed that, by 2030, the clean energy sector will be a 
        $230,000,000,000,000 global market for all technologies and 
        products that reduce carbon pollution, spurring economic 
        opportunity through job creation for people across the United 
        States and the world.
            (10) According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 
        renewable energy reduces greenhouse gas emissions and air 
        pollution associated with energy production.
            (11) The 2021 Department of Defense Climate Risk Analysis 
        found that increasing temperatures, changing precipitation 
        patterns, and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme 
        weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating 
        existing security risks.
            (12) In 2021, the Office of the Director of National 
        Intelligence assessed that climate change will increasingly 
        exacerbate risks to United States national security interests.
            (13) In 2021, the President issued an Executive order 
        directing the Federal Government to achieve 100 percent carbon 
        pollution-free electricity on a net annual basis by 2030 and 
        100 percent zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035.
            (14) In 2021, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio 
        Guterres, described the urgency of addressing climate change by 
        stating that ``the alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence 
        is irrefutable: greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel 
        burning and deforestation are choking our planet and putting 
        billions of people at immediate risk. Global heating is 
        affecting every region on Earth, with many of the changes 
        becoming irreversible''.
            (15) The Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC found that 
        ``human-induced climate change, including more frequent and 
        intense extreme events, has caused widespread adverse impacts 
        and related losses and damages to nature and people, beyond 
        natural climate variability''.
            (16) The IPCC notes that to avoid mounting loss of life, 
        biodiversity, and infrastructure, we must have ambitious, 
        accelerated action to adapt to climate change, while also 
        making rapid, deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.

USDA must (1) reevaluate and publish the market baskets of the plan by December 31, 2027, and every five years thereafter, based on current food prices, food composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance; and (2) make adjustments to the plan to account for household size, changes in the cost of the diet, and the costs of food in specified areas.
The bill modifies the requirements for calculating household income to determine SNAP eligibility by (1) authorizing a standard medical expense deduction for households containing an elderly or disabled member, and (2) eliminating the cap on the excess shelter expense deduction.
The bill eliminates certain work requirements for SNAP. The requirements apply to able-bodied adults who are ages 18-49 and have no dependent children.

Transparency Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) human activity is the dominant cause of observed 
        climate change in the past century;
            (2) climate change is increasing the frequency and 
        intensity of wildfires, droughts, severe storms, heat waves, 
        rising of sea levels, and severe weather events;
            (3) the Federal Government has--
                    (A) committed under the decision of the 21st 
                Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework 
                Convention on Climate Change, adopted in Paris, France, 
                December 12, 2015 (commonly referred to as the ``Paris 
                Agreement''), to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 
                to 52 percent by 2030; and
                    (B) a responsibility to mitigate current and future 
                impacts of climate change to protect the health, 
                safety, and welfare of individuals of the United 
                States;
            (4) crypto-asset mining operations--
                    (A) can be energy intensive; and
                    (B) unlike most other technologies, are often 
                designed to generally increase computing requirements 
                over time, which can lead to increased energy 
                consumption;
            (5) a crypto-asset network, Bitcoin, consumes more energy 
        annually than countries such as Chile or Bangladesh consume;
            (6) crypto-asset mining operations often rely on fossil 
        fuels for power, which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions;
            (7) the carbon dioxide emissions of the United States from 
        Bitcoin mining were estimated at 21 to 35 megatons per year in 
        2022, which is equivalent to the annual emissions from more 
        than 4,500,000 to 7,500,000 gasoline-powered cars driven for 1 
        year;
            (8) crypto-asset mining can also cause local noise and 
        water pollution;
            (9) the number of crypto-asset mining facilities in the 
        United States is increasing, and the share of the United States 
        of global Bitcoin mining rose from 3.5 percent in 2020 to 38 
        percent in 2022;
            (10) crypto-asset mining is an emergent industry, and the 
        potential of crypto-asset mining to exacerbate systemic racial, 
        social, environmental, and economic injustices is not 
        sufficiently understood;
            (11) there is no comprehensive, independent study of 
        crypto-asset mining operations in the United States, including 
        the energy use, resource mix, and greenhouse gas emissions of 
        those crypto-asset mining operations; and
            (12) one of the primary recommendations of the report of 
        the Office of Science and Technology Policy entitled ``Climate 
        and Energy Implications of Crypto-Assets in the United States'' 
        and dated September 2022 was to obtain detailed data on energy 
        use and emissions from crypto-asset activity.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Incentives and encouragement for the conservation and 
        appropriate handling of nutrients contained in organic matter 
        are necessary.
            (2) Biogas systems will save Federal, State, and local 
        taxpayers money by converting waste into useful products, such 
        as fuel, fertilizer, thermal heat, feedstock for hydrogen fuel 
        cells, and renewable chemicals.
            (3) Manure resource recovery systems will save Federal, 
        State, and local taxpayers money by recovering the nutrients 
        contained in organic matter from their source, rather than 
        recovering the nutrients after they have entered landfills or 
        waterways.

            ``(14) Forage fish are generally small to intermediate-
        sized species, occurring in schools or dense aggregations, and 
        function as a main pathway for energy to flow from phyto- and 
        zooplankton to higher trophic level predators, such as tuna, 
        Alaska pollock, and other wildlife, in marine ecosystems. While 
        most species function as prey of others at some life stage, 
        especially when small and young, forage fish maintain this 
        important trophic role throughout their life. Further, 
        fluctuations in their populations can result in significant 
        changes in marine communities and ecosystems. Therefore, 
        particular attention to management of forage fish species, and 
        addressing their unique role in marine ecosystems, is critical 
        to maintaining ecosystem function and sustainable fisheries.''.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Bear Poaching Elimination Act of

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) all 8 extant species of bear--Asian black bear, brown 
        bear, polar bear, American black bear, spectacled bear, giant 
        panda, sun bear, and sloth bear--are listed on appendix I or II 
        of CITES;
            (2) Article XIV of CITES provides that Parties to CITES may 
        adopt stricter domestic measures regarding the conditions for 
        trade, taking, possession, or transport of species listed on 
        appendix I or II of CITES, and the Parties to CITES adopted a 
        resolution in 1997 (Conf. 10.8) urging the Parties to take 
        immediate action to demonstrably reduce the illegal trade in 
        bear parts;
            (3) thousands of bears in Asia are cruelly confined in 
        small cages to be milked for their bile, and the wild Asian 
        bear population has declined significantly in recent years as a 
        result of habitat loss and poaching due to a strong demand for 
        bear viscera used in traditional medicines and cosmetics;
            (4) Federal and State undercover operations have revealed 
        that American bears have been poached for their viscera;
            (5) while most American black bear populations are 
        generally stable or increasing, commercial trade could 
        stimulate poaching and threaten certain populations if the 
        demand for bear viscera increases; and
            (6) prohibitions against the importation into the United 
        States and exportation from the United States, as well as 
        prohibitions against the interstate trade, of bear viscera and 
        products containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, 
        bear viscera will assist in ensuring that the United States 
        does not contribute to the decline of any bear population as a 
        result of the commercial trade in bear viscera.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

    The purpose of this Act is to ensure the long-term viability of the 
8 bear species of the world by--
            (1) prohibiting interstate and international trade in bear 
        viscera and products containing, or labeled or advertised as 
        containing, bear viscera;
            (2) encouraging bilateral and multilateral efforts to 
        eliminate that trade; and
            (3) ensuring that adequate Federal legislation exists with 
        respect to domestic trade in bear viscera and products 
        containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, bear 
        viscera.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) if current trends continue, average global temperatures 
        are likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial 
        levels between 2030 and 2050;
            (2) global temperature rise has already resulted in an 
        increased number of heavy rainstorms, coastal flooding events, 
        heat waves, wildfires, and other extreme events;
            (3) since 1980--
                    (A) the number of extreme weather events per year 
                that cost the people of the United States more than 
                $1,000,000,000 per event, accounting for inflation, has 
                increased significantly; and
                    (B) the total cost of extreme weather events in the 
                United States has exceeded $1,875,000,000,000;
            (4) as physical impacts from climate change are manifested 
        across multiple sectors of the economy of the United States--
                    (A) climate-related economic risks will continue to 
                increase;
                    (B) climate-related extreme weather events will 
                disrupt energy and transportation systems in the United 
                States, which will result in more frequent and longer-
                lasting power outages, fuel shortages, and service 
                disruptions in critical sectors across the economy of 
                the United States;
                    (C) projected increases in extreme heat conditions 
                will lead to decreases in labor productivity in 
                agriculture, construction, and other critical economic 
                sectors;
                    (D) food and livestock production will be impacted 
                in regions that experience increases in heat and 
                drought and small rural communities will struggle to 
                find the resources needed to adapt to those changes; 
                and
                    (E) sea level rise and more frequent and intense 
                extreme weather events will--
                            (i) increasingly disrupt and damage private 
                        property and critical infrastructure; and
                            (ii) drastically increase insured and 
                        uninsured losses;
            (5) advances in energy efficiency and renewable energy 
        technologies, as well as climate policies and shifting societal 
        preferences, will--
                    (A) reduce global demand for fossil fuels; and
                    (B) expose transition risks for fossil fuel 
                companies and investors, and for companies and 
                investors in other energy-intensive industries, which 
                could include trillions of dollars of stranded assets 
                around the world;
            (6) climate change poses uniquely far-reaching risks to the 
        financial services industry, including with respect to credit, 
        counterparty, and market risks, due to the number of sectors 
        and locations impacted and the potentially irreversible scale 
        of damage;
            (7) financial institutions must take a consistent approach 
        to assessing climate-related financial risks and incorporating 
        those risks into existing risk management practices, which 
        should be informed by scenario analysis;
            (8) the Board of Governors conducts annual assessments of 
        the capital adequacy and capital planning practices of the 
        largest and most complex banking organizations (referred to in 
        this section as ``stress tests'') in order to promote a safe, 
        sound, and efficient banking and financial system;
            (9) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the stress 
        tests conducted by the Board of Governors are not designed to 
        reflect the physical risks or transition risks posed by climate 
        change;
            (10) the Board of Governors--
                    (A) has the authority to take into account the 
                potentially systemic impact of climate-related risks on 
                the financial system; and
                    (B) should develop new analytical tools with longer 
                time horizons to accurately assess and manage the risks 
                described in subparagraph (A); and
            (11) the Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee of the 
        Commodity Futures Trading Commission has identified the 
        importance of researching ``climate-related `sub-systemic' 
        shocks to financial markets and institutions in particular 
        sectors and regions of the United States''.

    (a) In General.--
            (1) Initial development.--Not later than 1 year after the 
        date of enactment of this Act, the Board of Governors, in 
        coordination with the climate science leads, and taking into 
        consideration the recommendations of the Technical Development 
        Group, shall develop 3 separate climate change risk scenarios 
        as follows:
                    (A) One scenario that assumes an average increase 
                in global temperatures of 1.5 degrees Celsius above 
                pre-industrial levels.
                    (B) One scenario that assumes an average increase 
                in global temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-
                industrial levels.
                    (C) One scenario that--
                            (i) assumes the likely and very likely 
                        average increase in global temperatures that 
                        can be expected, taking into consideration the 
                        extent to which national policies and actions 
                        relating to climate change have been 
                        implemented, as of the date on which the 
                        scenario is developed, or on which the scenario 
                        is updated under paragraph (2), as applicable; 
                        and
                            (ii) does not take into consideration 
                        commitments for policies and actions relating 
                        to climate change that, as of the applicable 
                        date described in clause (i), have not been 
                        implemented.
            (2) Updates.--After the initial development of the climate 
        change risk scenarios under paragraph (1), the Board of 
        Governors, in coordination with the climate science leads, and 
        taking into consideration the recommendations of the Technical 
        Development Group, shall update those scenarios once every 3 
        years.
            (3) International coordination.--In developing and updating 
        the 3 scenarios required under this subsection, the Board of 
        Governors shall take into consideration analytic tools and best 
        practices developed by international banking supervisors 
        relating to climate risks and scenario analysis in an effort to 
        develop consistent and comparable data-driven scenarios.
            (4) Recommendations.--If the Technical Development Group 
        determines that the average increase in global temperatures 
        described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) is no 
        longer scientifically valid, the Technical Development Group 
        may recommend that the Board of Governors, in coordination with 
        the climate science leads, update the average increase in 
        global temperatures described in the applicable subparagraph to 
        reflect the most current assessment of climate change science.
    (b) Considerations.--In developing and updating each of the 3 
scenarios required under subsection (a), the Board of Governors, in 
coordination with the climate science leads, shall account for physical 
risks and transition risks that may disrupt business operations across 
the global economy, including through--
            (1) disruptions with respect to--
                    (A) the sourcing of materials;
                    (B) production; and
                    (C) the disposal of products and services;
            (2) changes in the availability and prices of raw materials 
        and other inputs;
            (3) changes in agricultural production and with respect to 
        food security;
            (4) direct damages to fixed assets;
            (5) increases in costs associated with insured or uninsured 
        losses;
            (6) changes in asset values;
            (7) impacts on--
                    (A) aggregate demand for products and services;
                    (B) labor productivity;
                    (C) asset liquidity; and
                    (D) credit availability;
            (8) mass migration and increases in disease and mortality 
        rates;
            (9) international conflict, as such conflict relates to 
        global economic activity and output; and
            (10) changes in any other microeconomic or macroeconomic 
        condition that the Board of Governors, in coordination with the 
        climate science leads, determines to be relevant.

SEC. 7. SUB-SYSTEMIC EXPLORATORY SURVEY.

    (a) Development of Survey.--The Board of Governors, in consultation 
with the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Directors of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, shall develop an exploratory 
survey to assess--
            (1) the ability of surveyed entities, including 
        agricultural banks, community banks, and other financial 
        institutions with a significant concentration of business 
        activities in certain geographical areas or industries, to 
        withstand each climate risk scenario developed under section 5; 
        and
            (2) how surveyed entities plan to make adaptations to the 
        business models and capital planning of those entities in 
        response to the risks presented in each climate change risk 
        scenario developed under section 5.
    (b) Administration of Survey.--
            (1) Initial administration.--
                    (A) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the 
                completion of the first analysis under subparagraph (C) 
                of section 165(i)(1) of the Financial Stability Act of 
                2010 (12 U.S.C. 5365(i)(1)), as added by section 6 of 
                this Act, the Board of Governors shall administer the 
                survey developed under subsection (a) to each surveyed 
                entity.
                    (B) Assessment and report.--Not later than 18 
                months after the date on which the Board of Governors 
                completes the administration of the survey under 
                subparagraph (A), the Board of Governors shall--
                            (i) assess the responses to the survey; and
                            (ii) publicly release a report that 
                        summarizes the results of the survey, which 
                        shall include the analysis of the Board of 
                        Governors regarding whether the planned actions 
                        of the surveyed entities to which the survey 
                        was administered, in the aggregate--
                                    (I) are plausible; and
                                    (II) would be effective.
            (2) Subsequent administration.--
                    (A) In general.--After the release of the report 
                required under paragraph (1)(B)(ii), the Board of 
                Governors shall, on a biennial basis, administer to 
                each surveyed entity the survey developed under 
                subsection (a).
                    (B) Subsequent report.--Not later than 180 days 
                after the date on which each survey administered under 
                subparagraph (A) is completed, the Board of Governors 
                shall publicly release a report that summarizes the 
                results of the survey, which shall include the analysis 
                described in paragraph (1)(B)(ii).
    (c) Effect of Survey Participation.--
            (1) In general.--With respect to a surveyed entity to which 
        any survey under this section is administered--
                    (A) subject to paragraph (2), the entity shall not 
                be subject to any adverse consequence on the basis of a 
                response provided by the entity to the survey; and
                    (B) in any report released with respect to the 
                survey, the Board of Governors may not identify any 
                individual response submitted by the entity to the 
                survey.
            (2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in paragraph (1)(A) may 
        be construed to preclude the Board of Governors from pursuing 
        an enforcement action against a surveyed entity because of a 
        violation discovered by the Board of Governors during an 
        examination of the surveyed entity that is independent of a 
        survey administered under this section.

SEC. 8. FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL.

    (a) In General.--The Financial Stability Oversight Council shall

        assessment required under paragraph (1) is submitted, the 
        Financial Stability Oversight Council shall include in the 
        annual report required under section 112(a)(2)(N) of the 
        Financial Stability Act of 2010 (12 U.S.C. 5322(a)(2)(N)) an

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ejiao Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Ejiao is a gelatin created from the skins of donkeys 
        which is used in traditional Chinese medicine, beauty, 
        cosmetic, and other luxury products.
            (2) The donkey skin trade for the production of ejiao, is 
        decimating global donkey populations and harming impoverished 
        global communities.
            (3) Studies have shown that the use of ejiao is unnecessary 
        in the production of these products since the gelatins from 
        other sources, including plants may be used instead.
            (4) Millions of donkeys are slaughtered annually for their 
        skins to make ejiao.
            (5) The domestic Chinese and international demand for 
        donkey skins is approximately 8,000,000 to 10,000,000 skins per 
        year but the annual supply in China is less than 1,800,000.
            (6) Such demand has led to the slaughter of massive numbers 
        of donkeys across the globe, decimating donkey populations, 
        most notably in Africa and Latin America.
            (7) Such demand has had devastating effects on the families 
        who depend on donkeys for survival, such as fetching water to 
        drink, cook and clean, taking products to market for sale, and 
        transporting children to school.
            (8) A recent report by the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock 
        Research Organization said that 159,631 donkeys were 
        slaughtered for their skins, 8.1 percent of the population, in 
        2018. Today, up to 1,000 donkeys a day can be slaughtered in 
        Kenya alone, more than 300,000 a year. The report goes on to 
        suggest that donkeys in Kenya could vanish by 2023.
            (9) Donkeys are regularly stolen and killed illegally 
        solely for their skins. Moreover, donkeys are often stolen from 
        families who depend on them for their livelihoods, and who are 
        already struggling and living below the poverty line of $2 a 
        day.
            (10) Where owners willingly sell their donkeys, they find 
        that within months they are worse off financially than they 
        would have been had they kept their donkeys. As prices 
        constantly rise, it becomes impossible for these owners to go 
        back into the market for a new donkey.
            (11) Although ejiao products are expensive, as the Chinese 
        middle class has expanded, demand for ejiao products has 
        exploded over the course of the last decade. As a result, the 
        donkey population in China has collapsed by 76 percent since 
        1992.
            (12) Ejiao companies have set up donkey breeding schemes in 
        China in an attempt to breed the species on a scale sufficient 
        to meet local demand. But due to the long gestation period of 
        donkeys, and the fact that they often only give birth once a 
        year, breeders have not been able to satisfy demand from within 
        China, which is why ejiao companies have turned to Africa and 
        Latin America to satisfy demand for ejiao.
            (13) A crisis in donkey populations has been met with 
        varied responses from affected countries. Bans in the trade of 
        donkey skins in seven African countries have been poorly 
        enforced or overturned.
            (14) As demand for ejiao continues unabated, donkey 
        populations in lower-income countries continue to nosedive, 
        despite governmental efforts to outlaw the trade.
            (15) A number of other United States-based companies have 
        already pledged to remove from the market all products 
        containing ejiao.
            (16) The leading importers in the world for ejiao are China 
        and Hong Kong. However, the United States is the third largest 
        importer of ejiao, with $12,000,000 in annual imports of ejiao 
        each year.

This bill sets out requirements for the disposition of human fetal tissue from an abortion.
Specifically, it requires abortion providers to obtain a patient's informed consent for one of two specified methods of disposition.
First, patients may choose to retain possession of the tissue. A patient may choose to transfer the tissue to an entity that provides interment or cremation services.
Second, in cases where the tissue is expelled on the provider’s premises, the patient may elect to release the tissue to the provider. Providers must ensure any tissue released to them is interred or cremated within seven days of the procedure in a manner consistent with state law regarding the disposal of human remains.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Providing Responsible Emergency 
Plans for Animals at Risk of Emerging Disasters Act'' or the ``PREPARED 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Recent natural and man-made disasters have highlighted 
        the need for planning to minimize the impact of disasters.
            (2) Lack of preparedness in times of disaster can have 
        especially devastating effects on animals and the people who 
        risk their lives to protect them.
            (3) Local first-responders, nongovernmental agencies, and 
        private individuals most often shoulder the cost and 
        responsibility of animals affected by disasters.
            (4) It is reasonable to ask those who use animals 
        commercially to demonstrate a level of readiness to protect the 
        animals under their care.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Animal Cruelty Enforcement Act of 
2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) There is a significant connection between animal 
        cruelty and violence against humans, domestic violence, child 
        abuse, sexual abuse, homicide, gang activity, drug trafficking, 
        and other crimes.
            (2) Animal fighting activity may increase the spread of 
        diseases transmitted between animals and people.
            (3) A number of Federal laws have been enacted to address 
        cruelty to animals.
            (4) Recognizing the connection between animal cruelty and 
        serious crimes the Federal Bureau of Investigation tracks 
        animal cruelty crimes.
            (5) There is bipartisan and widespread public support for 
        addressing animal cruelty.
            (6) There is a government interest in ensuring laws are 
        robustly enforced for the betterment and protection of society.
            (7) The lack of a dedicated animal crimes enforcement unit 
        within the Department of Justice has resulted in unacceptable 
        delays in prosecutions, and an overall lack of prosecution, of 
        animal crimes.
            (8) Dedicated staff and resources at the Department of 
        Justice will facilitate successful enforcement of animal 
        cruelty laws, which often have unique investigative elements, 
        by providing specialized knowledge and focus, and streamlining 
        the handling of these offenses.

        unless--
                    (A) in the case of such testing on an ingredient or 
                nonfunctional constituent, there is no non-animal 
                alternative method or strategy recognized by any 
                Federal agency, the Interagency Coordinating Committee 
                on the Validation of Alternative Methods, or the 
                Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
                for the relevant safety endpoints for such ingredient 
                or nonfunctional constituent; and

                        Development for the relevant safety endpoints 
                        for the cosmetic ingredient or nonfunctional 
                        constituent;
                            (ii) there is a reasonable probability that 
                        the ingredient or nonfunctional constituent 
                        poses a specific and serious adverse human 
                        health risk and the need to conduct an animal 
                        test is justified and supported by a detailed 
                        research protocol that is proposed for the 
                        basis for evaluation of the cosmetic ingredient

                            (iii) the cosmetic ingredient or 
                        nonfunctional constituent is in wide use and, 
                        in the case of a cosmetic ingredient, cannot be 
                        replaced by another cosmetic ingredient capable 
                        of performing a similar function;
                    (B) publication by the Secretary, on the website of 
                the Food and Drug Administration, of the written 
                finding under subparagraph (A) together with a notice 
                that the Secretary intends to request, require, or 
                conduct new animal testing, and providing a period of 
                not less than 60 calendar days for public comment; and
                    (C) a written determination by the Secretary, after 
                review of all public comments received pursuant to 
                subparagraph (B), that no previously generated data 
                that could be substituted for, or otherwise determined 
                sufficient to replace, the data expected to be produced 
                through new animal testing is available for review by

        requirement of a Federal, State, or foreign regulatory 
        authority.
    (e) Rule of Construction.--With the exception of records or other 
information demonstrating compliance with subsection (c)(1)(B)(ii), 
nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the Secretary 
to impose any new recordkeeping requirements relating to cosmetic 
animal testing.
    (f) Civil Penalties.--
            (1) In general.--In addition to any other penalties under 
        applicable law, any person who violates this section may be

        $10,000 for each such violation, as determined by the 
        Secretary.
            (2) Multiple violations.--Each violation of this section 
        with respect to a separate animal, and each day that a 
        violation of this Act continues, constitutes a separate 
        offense.
    (g) Records Access.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary may request any records or 
        other information from a cosmetic manufacturer that such 
        manufacturer relied upon to meet the criteria in subsection 
        (c)(1)(B)(ii). Such manufacturer shall, upon such request of 
        the Secretary in writing, provide to the Secretary such records 
        or other information, within a reasonable timeframe, within 
        reasonable limits, and in a reasonable manner, and in either 
        electronic or physical form, at the expense of such 
        manufacturer. The Secretary's request shall include a 
        sufficient description of the records requested and reference 
        this subsection.
            (2) Confirmation of receipt.--Upon receipt of the records 
        requested under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall provide to 
        the manufacturer confirmation of receipt.
            (3) Inspection authority.--Nothing in this subsection 
        supplants the authority of the Secretary to conduct inspections 
        otherwise permitted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
        Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.).
    (h) State Authority.--No State or political subdivision of a State 
may establish or continue in effect any prohibition relating to 
cosmetic animal testing, or to the regulation of data use, labeling, 
and packaging related to animal testing, that is not identical to the 
prohibitions set forth in subsections (a), (b), (c), and (j) and that 
does not include the exemptions contained in subsections (c), (d), and

                days for public comment regarding such strategic plan;
                    (C) include in the strategic plan developed under 
                subparagraph (A) a list (which the Secretary shall 
                update on a regular basis, and which shall be for 
                informational purposes and shall not be deemed to 
                constitute a list of the only acceptable non-animal

                          climate adaptation.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) because most native plant species are genetically 
        adapted to their local environment, climate change and invasive 
        species result in plants no longer being locally adapted;
            (2) to promote restoration success, a network of integrated 
        field trials (also known as provenance trials or common 
        gardens) is crucial to determine which populations of dominant 
        plants can survive current and projected future conditions, 
        which in turn will enable the development of precision models 
        to forecast climate change impacts on key native riparian 
        forest species and the species that depend upon them for their 
        survival; and
            (3) riparian systems are integral to and essential to 
        wetland health and preservation, research into, and efforts to 
        restore and protect the health of riparian ecosystems is 
        essential.

SEC. 2. RESEARCH GRANTS FOR PROJECTS RELATED TO RIPARIAN FOREST 
              GENETICS AND CLIMATE ADAPTATION.

    The Secretary of the Interior shall establish a grant program for 
eligible entities to carry out projects that involve long-term research 
into plant genetics and genomics to make riparian forests and streams 
more resilient to climate change and invasive species and to provide 
critical habitat for birds, native fish, endangered species and other 
animals and plants that are suffering from lost, degraded, or 
threatened habitat. The Secretary shall determine entities eligible to 
receive such grants, projects eligible for such grants, application and 
approval procedures for such grants, and any limitations on the amount 
and uses of such grants, and any other terms and conditions the 
Secretary determines appropriate.

SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF RIPARIAN FOREST.

    As used in this Act, the term ``riparian forest'' means any 
riparian area and includes all plant, animal, insect, and microbial 
communities in such areas.

SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

    There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of the 
Interior $13,000,000 for each of fiscals years 2022 through 2031 to 
carry out the grant program established under section 2.

This bill expands the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and establishes programs to address food insecurity among college students.
Specifically, the bill permanently modifies the eligibility requirements to allow additional college students to receive SNAP benefits, and it establishes a demonstration program to allow college students to use SNAP benefits on college campuses instead of meal plans. The bill also advances implementation of certain data-sharing agreements and notifications to help students who apply for federal financial aid to also apply for and receive other federal means-tested benefits (e.g., Section 8 tenant-based housing assistance, Medicaid, and Supplemental Security Income).
In addition, the bill (1) requires questions about food and housing insecurity to be incorporated into the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, and (2) establishes a grant program to support research and address incidences of food and housing insecurity among college students.","To amend the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to expand the eligibility 
  of students to participate in the supplemental nutrition assistance 
   program, establish college student food insecurity demonstration

Currently, the Wire Act contains four prohibitions on the use of a wire transmission facility (e.g., the telephone or internet) for certain gambling activities. All four prohibitions apply to sports gambling. However, there have been conflicting interpretations of the applicability of the prohibitions to nonsports gambling (e.g., state lotteries).
This bill amends the Wire Act to expressly state that the statute does not authorize the use of wire communications to gamble on commercial greyhound racing or permit the transport of animals for commercial dog racing or related activities.","To amend the Wire Act to clarify that gambling on commercial greyhound 
   racing and field coursing using wire communication technology is 
                              prohibited.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Greyhound Protection Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Greyhounds have existed for thousands of years and are 
        the only canines mentioned by name in the Bible.
            (2) Commercial greyhound racing was first legalized in 
        Florida in 1931.
            (3) Modern racetracks require internet-based wire 
        communications to process bets and wagers, calculate odds, 
        broadcast races, announce results, and pay winnings to 
        gamblers.
            (4) Public records reveal that some greyhounds used for 
        live commercial racing suffer serious injuries including broken 
        backs, broken necks, head trauma, paralysis, seizures, and 
        electrocution.
            (5) State records show that some racing greyhounds test 
        positive for drugs including cocaine, amphetamines, 
        barbituates, opiods, and steroids.
            (6) State investigatory files document that racing 
        greyhounds are kept confined for 20-23 hours a day in stacked, 
        metal cages, typically with little opportunity to socialize 
        with other dogs.
            (7) Many small animals, including but not limited to 
        rabbits and hares, are bought, sold, delivered, transported, 
        and received in interstate and foreign commerce for use as live 
        bait in the training of racing greyhounds and in open field 
        coursing.
            (8) Typically, animals used in the live lure training of 
        greyhounds may be dragged on ropes, hung from a horizontal pole 
        which rotates around a training track or simply set loose to be 
        chased and mauled. Alive or dead, helpless bait animals may be 
        used repeatedly until they are torn apart.
            (9) Live lure training is prohibited in more than a dozen 
        States, but there is no Federal statute. In the late 1970's, 
        the National Greyhound Association, a membership organization 
        representing breeders, trainers and other industry 
        participants, announced a policy against live lure training in 
        order to convince then-Senators Birch Bayh and Robert Dole to 
        withdraw their proposed legislation.
            (10) Open field coursing preceded commercial dog racing and 
        is an activity in which greyhounds or other sighthounds are 
        released to pursue and kill bait animals, often in a fenced 
        area. Greyhounds often collide and suffer injuries in the 
        chase.
            (11) Dog owners travel from multiple States and countries 
        to compete and win prizes and sometimes gamble on open field 
        coursing events.
            (12) As with commercial greyhound racing, internet sites 
        are used to promote coursing tournaments and post results to a 
        worldwide audience.
            (13) The National Field Coursing Association is the 
        umbrella group for coursing clubs nationwide and had 12 clubs 
        in California as of 2006.
            (14) Open field coursing is illegal in as many as 12 
        States.
            (15) Open field coursing was prohibited as a blood sport in 
        Scotland in 2002 and in the United Kingdom in 2004.
            (16) Twenty-five years ago, there were 60 greyhound tracks 
        in the United States. Once a voter-approved ballot measure 
        prohibiting greyhound racing takes full effect in Florida in 
        2020 and the voluntary shut down of Southland Park in Arkansas 
        takes place as of 2022, no more than 5 tracks will remain 
        throughout the country.
            (17) According to the State of Florida, track owners had 
        been collectively losing more than $30 million annually because 
        of sagging attendance and decreased wagering. According to a 
        State-commissioned report, the State spent more money 
        regulating the industry in its national hub than it generated 
        in tax revenue.
            (18) As of December 31, 2022, live commercial dog racing 
        will be illegal in 41 States. This dying industry will remain 
        legal and operational in no more than 4 States.
    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the Congress in this chapter to 
prohibit the use of wire communications for the purpose of gambling on 
live, commercial greyhound racing and open field coursing events and to 
prohibit the transport of animals including but not limited to 
greyhounds, rabbits, and hares in interstate and foreign commerce in 
furtherance of these activities.

SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF GREYHOUNDS.

     Section 1084 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding 
at the end the following new section:
    ``(f) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to 
authorize gambling on commercial greyhound racing taking place 
domestically or internationally using wire communications or to permit 
the transport of animals for the purpose of conducting or furthering 
commercial dog racing, live lure training or field coursing.''.

SEC. 4. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.

    Nothing in this Act, or the amendments made by this Act, shall be 
construed--
            (1) to preempt any State law prohibiting gambling or 
        protecting the welfare of animals including but not limited to 
        greyhounds, rabbits, and hares; or
            (2) to alter, limit, or extend the relationship between the 
        Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 (15 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.) as 
        it relates to horse racing and other Federal laws in effect on 
        the date of enactment of this Act.

SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.

    The amendment made by section 3 shall take effect on December 31, 
2022.

This bill eliminates new fossil fuel production projects on federal public land and waters.
Specifically, it prohibits the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) from issuing, renewing, reinstating, or extending any nonproducing lease, or issuing any authorization for the exploration or production of fossil fuel on the Outer Continental Shelf. BOEM must also cancel any lease issued in the Beaufort Sea, Cook Inlet, or Chukchi Sea (three of the five bodies of water that encompass the Alaska Outer Continental Shelf).
Further, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) may not issue, renew, reinstate, or extend any nonproducing lease for the exploration or production of any onshore fossil fuels on land subject to the Mineral Leasing Act.
The bill provides for exceptions if there is an imminent national security threat that would be significantly reduced by granting an exception. In addition, BOEM and the BLM may allow a nonproducing lease to be renewed or extended if (1) the lease contract was signed before enactment of this bill, and (2) it is determined that giving effect to any provision of this bill is likely to lead to a judicial ruling that there was a material breach of the nonproducing lease contract.","To prohibit drilling in the outer Continental Shelf, to prohibit coal

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Keep It in the Ground Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) from 1880 through 2015, global temperatures have 
        increased by about 1.06 degrees Celsius;
            (2) the vast majority of global warming that has occurred 
        over the past 50 years was due to human activities, primarily 
        the burning of fossil fuels;
            (3) emissions of greenhouse gases and atmospheric 
        concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to rise, which 
        results in a continued warming trend;
            (4) global warming already has a significant impact on the 
        economy, including the farming, fishing, forestry, and 
        recreation industries;
            (5) the significant impacts of global warming that are 
        already occurring will be amplified by a global temperature 
        increase of 2 degrees Celsius, which will lead to increased 
        droughts, rising seas, mass extinctions, heat waves, 
        desertification, wildfires, acidifying oceans, significant 
        economic disruption, and security threats;
            (6) to avoid exceeding 2 degrees Celsius warming, at least 
        80 percent of carbon from proven fossil fuel reserves must be 
        kept in the ground;
            (7) the potential emissions resulting from extracting and 
        burning all fossil fuels on Federal land and waters amounts to 
        a significant percentage of the greenhouse gas emissions limit; 
        and
            (8) ending new leases for fossil fuels will prevent the 
        release of 90 percent of the potential emissions from Federal 
        fossil fuels.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States 
that--
            (1) Federal land and waters should be managed for the 
        benefit of the people of the United States--
                    (A) to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate 
                change; and
                    (B) to promote a rapid transition to a clean energy 
                economy by keeping fossil fuels in the ground; and
            (2) the Federal Government should pursue management of 
        Federal land and waters for the benefit of the people of the 
        United States by not issuing any new lease or renewing any 
        nonproducing lease for coal, oil, or natural gas in any Federal 
        land or waters.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Prohibit Wildlife Killing Contests 
Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Wildlife killing contests are organized events in which 
        participants kill animals for cash, prizes, entertainment, or 
        other inducements. Judging categories for wildlife killing 
        contests include, but are not limited to, the number of animals 
        killed, the weight or the sex of animals killed, a tiered point 
        system by species killed, or the smallest or largest body or 
        body part size of animals killed.
            (2) Wildlife killing contests often target ecologically 
        important carnivores, including foxes, bobcats, and coyotes.
            (3) Scientific evidence does not support claims that 
        wildlife killing contests permanently reduce populations of 
        targeted species, increase populations of deer or other game 
        species, or prevent conflict between native carnivores, humans, 
        pets, and livestock.
            (4) Because participants often wastefully discard targeted 
        wildlife, wildlife killing contests do not embody the hunting 
        principles set forth by the North America Wildlife Conservation 
        Model, which includes a requirement that wildlife only be 
        killed for a legitimate purpose. As a result, numerous State 
        agencies and officials have recognized that these contests can 
        undermine public support for hunting and damage the reputation 
        of sportsmen and sportswomen who abide by traditional hunting 
        ethics.
            (5) As of March 1, 2022, Arizona, California, New Mexico, 
        Vermont, Massachusetts, Colorado, Maryland, and Washington have 
        banned wildlife killing contests that target certain species.
            (6) Wildlife killing contests held on Federal lands 
        undermine Federal wildlife management practices, public trust 
        duties, and conservation ethics.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON WILDLIFE KILLING CONTESTS.

    (a) Prohibitions.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), it is 
        unlawful for any person to organize, sponsor, conduct, or 
        participate in a wildlife killing contest on public land.
            (2) Exceptions.--This subsection shall not apply to--
                    (A) field trials;
                    (B) wildlife killing contests that exclusively 
                target ungulates or birds of the orders Galliformes or 
                Anatidae; or
                    (C) lethal control actions by State or Federal 
                agencies that target wildlife classified as invasive by 
                the National Invasive Species Information Center.
    (b) Regulations.--Not later than one year after the date of 
enactment of this Act, each head of a public land management agency 
shall issue such regulations as are necessary to carry out this 
section.
    (c) Effect on Preemption.--This section shall not be construed to

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Plastic Waste Reduction and 
Recycling Research Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) It is estimated that global production of plastic has 
        increased from 2,000,000 tons of plastic per year in 1950 to 
        400,000,000 tons per year today, and of the 8.3 billion metric 
        tons of plastic ever produced globally, 6.3 billion metric tons 
        has become plastic waste.
            (2) The United States has failed to invest in the 
        development of domestic recycling markets, technology and 
        materials to make the recycling process more available and 
        efficient, and as a result, the United States recycles only 9 
        percent of its plastic waste.
            (3) For more than 2 decades, the United States and other 
        developed nations sold and exported 106,000,000 metric tons of 
        recyclable plastics to China, but in 2018 China issued a ban on 
        contaminated United States plastics.
            (4) Following the 2018 China ban, more and more United 
        States communities are sending recyclable items to landfills or 
        incinerators.
            (5) As recycling programs have moved toward single-stream 
        curbside recycling, more recyclable items are mixed with non-
        recyclable items, resulting in fewer potentially recyclable 
        items actually being recycled and turned into new, valuable 
        products.
            (6) The resin identification coding system in use today has 
        not been substantially updated since its creation in 1988.
            (7) Characterizing the type and recyclability of different 
        types of plastics in use today requires updated standards.
            (8) Separating and processing the many different types of 
        plastics as well as the heterogenous materials containing 
        multiple layers of different plastic types commonly in use 
        today will require new sorting and recycling technologies.
            (9) There are currently limited private or public 
        investments in research and development to improve plastic 
        waste reduction, recycling technologies, or other technologies 
        and processes to reduce the amount and impact of plastic waste.
            (10) The Federal Government can play an important role in 
        supporting research and development and facilitating standards, 
        tools, and technologies needed across the different stages of 
        the plastics production and recycling ecosystem.

USDA must (1) reevaluate and publish the market baskets of the plan by January 1, 2027, and every five years thereafter, based on current food prices, food composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance; and (2) make adjustments to the plan to account for household size, changes in the cost of the diet, and the costs of food in specified areas.
The bill modifies the requirements for calculating household income to determine SNAP eligibility by (1) authorizing a standard medical expense deduction for households containing an elderly or disabled member, and (2) eliminating the cap on the excess shelter expense deduction.
The bill eliminates certain work requirements for SNAP. The requirements apply to able-bodied adults who are ages 18-49 and have no dependent children.
The bill allows Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands to participate in SNAP. Currently, the three territories receive block grants instead of participating in SNAP.","To amend the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to require that

This bill sets forth requirements and incentives to reduce the production of a variety of products and materials, including plastics, and increase efforts to collect, recycle, or compost products and materials.
The bill makes certain producers of products (e.g., packaging, paper, single-use products, beverage containers, or food service products) fiscally responsible for collecting, managing, and recycling or composting the products after consumer use. In addition, the bill establishes (1) minimum percentages of products that must be reused, recycled, or composted; and (2) an increasing percentage of recycled content that must be contained in beverage containers.
Beginning on January 1, 2023, the bill phases out a variety of single-use products, such as plastic utensils. The bill also sets forth provisions to encourage the reduction of single-use products, including by establishing programs to refund consumers for returning beverage containers and by establishing a tax on carryout bags.
The bill creates a temporary moratorium on new or expanded permits for certain facilities that manufacture plastics until regulations are updated to address pollution from the facilities.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must publish guidelines for a national standardized labeling system for recycling and composting receptacles. Producers must include labels on their products that are easy to read and indicate whether the products are recyclable, compostable, or reusable. The EPA must also ensure that certain clothes washers have filtration units as required by this bill.
Finally, the bill establishes limitations on the export of plastic waste to other countries.","To amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to reduce the production and use 
 of certain single-use plastic products and packaging, to improve the 
     responsibility of producers in the design, collection, reuse, 
 recycling, and disposal of their consumer products and packaging, to 
 prevent pollution from consumer products and packaging from entering 
    into animal and human food chains and waterways, and for other 
                               purposes.

                          Investment Policies.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Retirees Sustainable Investment 
Opportunities Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) There is now incontrovertible evidence that 
        environmental, social, and governance (hereinafter in this Act 
        referred to as ``ESG'') factors can have material and 
        substantial effects on investment performance.
            (2) The United States Department of Labor which is 
        responsible for administering and enforcing the Employee 
        Retirement Security Act of 1974 has historically recognized 
        that retirement plans may make economically targeted 
        investments (``ETIs''), that is, investments that offer the 
        potential for economic benefits, such as local job creation, 
        community economic development, and affordable and workforce 
        housing construction, in addition to investment returns, 
        provided such investments otherwise comply with ERISA's 
        fiduciary requirements.
            (3) ESG and ETI-related factors are referred to in this Act 
        as ``sustainability considerations'' and investments guided by 
        sustainability considerations are referred to as ``sustainable 
        investments.'' Sustainable investments have the potential to 
        contribute to the long-term well-being and resilience of 
        individuals and communities in this nation and around the world 
        while earning investment returns comparable to or better than 
        investments with similar risk that do not take these factors 
        into account.
            (4) Sustainable investing is now among the fastest growing 
        segments of the investment industry with broad and growing 
        interest from both individual investors and institutional asset 
        managers. Nevertheless, sustainable investments are virtually 
        absent from ERISA-regulated retirement plans in the United 
        States.
            (5) Retirement plans and participants in individual account 
        retirement plans should have the opportunity to make and hold 
        sustainable investments, provided ERISA's fiduciary 
        requirements are otherwise met.
            (6) Accordingly, fiduciaries for retirement plans should--
                    (A) incorporate all relevant factors, including 
                sustainability-related factors, into investment 
                analysis and decision-making processes, consistent with 
                the investment time horizons of plan participants and 
                beneficiaries;
                    (B) be permitted to consider factors relevant to 
                sustainability, whether or not they can be demonstrated 
                to be financially material, provided doing so does not 
                diminish anticipated investment returns or increase 
                investment risk and is otherwise consistent with 
                ERISA's fiduciary requirements;
                    (C) encourage the adoption of best practices for 
                sustainability performance and sustainability impacts 
                in the companies or other entities in which they 
                invest;
                    (D) consider plan participants' and beneficiaries' 
                sustainability-related interests and preferences when 
                making investment decisions;
                    (E) consider the impact of plan investments on the 
                stability and resilience of the financial system and on 
                broad market returns as a result of the sustainability 
                characteristics of those investments;
                    (F) consider participation in shareholder 
                engagement and proxy activities, policy advocacy and 
                similar actions based on sustainability considerations; 
                and
                    (G) disclose how they have implemented these 
                commitments.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to enable retirement and welfare benefit 
plans and participants in individual account retirement plans that are 
covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 
U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), to make and hold sustainable investments, 
consistent with the fiduciary standards, requirements, and procedures 
of said Employee Retirement Income Security Act.

        do so if it gives notice to plan participants or beneficiaries 
        in writing of such election''; and
            (2) by adding after subsection (c) the following:

2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of 
        the United Nations, 31 percent of land on earth is covered in 
        forests, but that area is rapidly decreasing. An estimated 
        1,600,000 square miles of forest has been converted to other 
        land uses since 1990, with 42,500 square miles converted 
        annually since 2010. Since the early 2000s, \2/3\ of global 
        forest cover loss has occurred in the tropics and subtropics.
            (2) The expansion of commercial agriculture into tropical 
        forests is the largest driver of forest conversion, led by 
        cattle ranching and the cultivation of soy and palm oil. An 
        estimated 69 percent of such conversion between 2013 and 2019 
        was carried out in contravention of the laws of the country in 
        which the conversion occurred.
            (3) Such illegal deforestation results in the emission of 
        more than 2.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year, 
        more than the entire annual fossil fuel emissions of India in 
        2018.
            (4) Limiting global temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius 
        above preindustrialized levels requires rapid and significant 
        reductions in deforestation globally. Cost-effective greenhouse 
        gas emission mitigation from forests and land use can provide 
        roughly \1/3\ of the mitigation required by 2030 to stay below 
        2 degrees Celsius.
            (5) Forests contain most of the world's terrestrial 
        biodiversity, providing habitats for 80 percent of amphibian 
        species, 75 percent of bird species, 68 percent of mammal 
        species, and 60,000 different species of trees.
            (6) Forests are also an important source of livelihoods, 
        food, and fuel, with more than 1,600,000,000 people depending 
        directly on forests for their livelihoods.
            (7) The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on 
        Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services found in 2019 that the rate 
        of global species extinction is accelerating and is now tens to 
        hundreds of times higher than the average rate over the last 
        10,000,000 years, threatening the loss of 1,000,000 species, 
        and land-use change is the direct driver with the largest 
        relative impact on terrestrial ecosystems.
            (8) Deforestation in many countries is closely associated 
        with violations of the rights of indigenous peoples and local 
        communities and with the exploitation of workers, including 
        through the use forced labor and child labor, and in many cases 
        is enabled by corruption, criminality, and violence against 
        individuals defending their land rights and environment.
            (9) According to the United Nations High Commissioner for 
        Human Rights, individuals defending the rights of communities 
        and indigenous peoples to their traditional lands and 
        environment are particularly vulnerable to threats and violence 
        and accounted for roughly half of the killings of human rights 
        defenders documented in 2019.
            (10) Congress has taken a number of steps to address the 
        trade in illegal timber to protect legitimate forestry 
        businesses and reduce illegal logging globally, such as, in 
        section 8204 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 
        (Public Law 110-246; 122 Stat. 2052), amending the Lacey Act 
        Amendments of 1981 (16 U.S.C. 3371 et seq.) to prohibit the 
        importation of illegal plant products, including such products 
        made from illegally logged wood.
            (11) As with illegal timber, agricultural commodities 
        produced on illegally deforested land enter international 
        markets, including the United States, and compete with 
        commodities produced legally.
            (12) The United States is a significant market for products 
        made wholly or in part of commodities such as palm oil, cattle, 
        cocoa, and rubber at risk of being produced on illegally 
        deforested land. For example, in 2020, the United States 
        imported--
                    (A) processed cowhides and beef products valued at 
                more than $500,000,000 from Brazil, where cattle 
                ranching is the largest driver of deforestation in the 
                Amazon forest and other biomes, and an estimated 95 
                percent of all deforestation was not in full compliance 
                with applicable laws; and
                    (B) crude palm oil and palm kernel oil valued at 
                more than $880,000,000 and oleochemicals commonly 
                derived from palm oils valued at more than 
                $390,000,000, from Indonesia, where the expansion of 
                palm oil plantations is the largest driver of 
                deforestation, and government audits of the sector in 
                recent years have indicated widespread noncompliance 
                with applicable laws.
            (13) The lack of traceability in the supply chains for such 
        commodities and the absence of importer due diligence 
        requirements increases the risk that United States trade is 
        associated with illegal deforestation and human rights abuses, 
        preventing United States consumers from knowing where or how 
        the goods they purchase were produced and putting companies 
        that ensure legal sourcing at a competitive disadvantage.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States must do more to address illegal deforestation from agricultural 
commodities, including--
            (1) avoiding trade that incentivizes foreign governments to 
        allow illegal deforestation;
            (2) assisting foreign governments in eliminating illegal 
        deforestation and limiting all deforestation to the extent 
        practicable;
            (3) requiring that goods entering the United States market 
        be subject to requirements, including the necessary supply 
        chain traceability, to reduce the risk of association with 
        illegal deforestation;
            (4) preventing the United States financial system from 
        being used to launder proceeds from illegal deforestation; and
            (5) providing incentives to suppliers of the Federal 
        Government to adopt and implement policies to eliminate goods 
        produced on or from deforested land from their supply chains.

              DEFORESTED LAND AND PRODUCTS MADE FROM SUCH COMMODITIES.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Traveling Exotic Animal and Public 
Safety Protection Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) conditions inherent to traveling performances, 
        including constant travel, temporary and collapsible 
        facilities, and the prolonged confinement and physical coercion 
        of animals, subject exotic and wild animals to compromised 
        welfare and chronic stress, and present public and worker 
        health and safety risks not adequately addressed by current 
        regulations;
            (2) current regulatory oversight of traveling performances 
        is complex and costly, and those costs are not typically 
        recouped via licensing fees but are left to the taxpayer;
            (3) the frequent mobility of traveling performances 
        complicates oversight such that agencies and authorities cannot 
        properly monitor, evaluate, or follow through regarding the 
        condition of animals or facilities, or their history of 
        potential injuries, incidents, illnesses, violations, or other 
        issues, and so cannot properly protect animals, workers, or the 
        public;
            (4) traveling exotic and wild animal performances use 
        collapsible, temporary, mobile facilities, which risk escape 
        and serious harm to animals, workers, and the public;
            (5) traveling exotic and wild animal performances present 
        safety risks by permitting or not preventing public contact and 
        by displaying animals in inappropriate, uncontrolled areas in 
        dangerous proximity to humans and other animals;
            (6) exotic and wild animals have intrinsic value;
            (7) the wild instincts and needs of exotic and wild animals 
        are unpredictable and not naturally suited to traveling 
        performances, and exotic and wild animals thus suffer as a 
        result of being unable to fulfill instinctive natural 
        behaviors;
            (8) exotic and wild animals used in traveling performances 
        suffer severe and extended confinement, and, deprived of 
        natural movements and behaviors, are prone to chronic stress 
        and behavioral, health, and psychological problems;
            (9) exotic and wild animals are forced to perform unnatural 
        tricks requiring extreme physical coercion, including the use 
        of food and water restrictions, electric shock devices, 
        bullhooks, metal bars, whips, shovels, pitchforks, and other 
        abuses;
            (10) it is not necessary to use exotic or wild animals in 
        traveling performances to experience the circus or similar 
        events;
            (11) using exotic or wild animals as commodities traded for 
        traveling performances adds nothing to the understanding and 
        conservation of those animals and the natural environment, and 
        actually undermines conservation efforts necessary to protect 
        threatened and endangered species;
            (12) it is not possible to provide or ensure public and 
        worker safety or appropriate physical and mental welfare of 
        exotic and wild animals under the traveling performance 
        business model, which inherently and significantly restricts 
        the natural movements and behaviors of animals, and in which 
        abuse is prevalent and oversight problematic;
            (13) the use of exotic or wild animals in traveling 
        performances is or substantially affects interstate or foreign 
        commerce and the free flow of interstate or foreign commerce;
            (14) it is essential to regulate the use of exotic or wild 
        animals in traveling performances to ensure the humane care and 
        treatment of animals; and
            (15) restricting the use of exotic and wild animals in 
        traveling performances is the most cost-effective and efficient 
        way to safeguard animals, workers, and the public.

This bill allows tax credits and grants for activities that provide access to healthy food in food deserts, which are communities that have limited or no access to grocery stores and meet income requirements.
For entities that are certified by the Department of the Treasury as special access food providers using specified criteria, the bill allows tax credits for operating a new grocery store or renovating an existing grocery store in a food desert. The bill also authorizes grants for a portion of (1) the construction costs of building a permanent food bank in a food desert, and (2) the annual operating costs of temporary access merchants (mobile markets, farmers markets, and food banks).
Treasury, in coordination with the Department of Agriculture (USDA), must annually allocate the tax credits and grants to special access food providers. Grants authorized by this bill are not considered gross income for tax purposes.
The bill also requires USDA to update the Food Access Research Atlas at least annually to account for food retailers that are placed in service during that year.","To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to establish a new tax

This bill establishes additional requirements for larger animal feeding operations (AFOs) owned or controlled by industrial operators and increases handling requirements for livestock and poultry.
Specifically, the bill establishes the Office of High-Risk AFO Disaster Mitigation and Enforcement within the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and requires such industrial operators to register with the office and submit annual disaster mitigation plans (e.g., for public health emergencies and major disasters). In addition, industrial operators must pay annual disaster mitigation maintenance fees to the office and are liable for costs associated with disaster events or depopulation (the rapid destruction of animals in response to urgent circumstances).
Industrial operators are restricted from using specified methods of depopulation; any person may sue an industrial operator or USDA over a violation. Further, USDA must establish depopulation standards that rapidly induce unconsciousness and death with minimal pain and distress.
The Department of Labor must enforce minimum labor standards for industrial operators regarding covered workers or affected contract growers in disaster mitigation events, including whistleblower protections and health insurance requirements. Further, industrial operators may not use incarcerated workers in these events.
The bill also includes provisions on the handling of livestock and poultry, such as","To establish the Office of High-Risk AFO Disaster Mitigation and 
 Enforcement in the Department of Agriculture, and for other purposes.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) factory farms owned or controlled by industrial 
        operators--
                    (A) lack systemic resilience;
                    (B) present significant risks, particularly in the 
                event of a disaster; and
                    (C) negatively impact--
                            (i) farmed animals, who suffer tremendously 
                        from cruel depopulation methods and without 
                        meaningful disaster mitigation efforts;
                            (ii) meat and poultry processing workers, 
                        who are subjected to exploitative conditions 
                        and abusive behavior by employers in 
                        depopulation situations--
                                    (I) including--
                                            (aa) being required to 
                                        spend long hours, over days or 
                                        weeks, mass-killing farmed 
                                        animals; and
                                            (bb) being terminated 
                                        following the completion of a 
                                        depopulation event, without 
                                        financial support; and
                                    (II) that lead to long-term 
                                psychological impacts, including 
                                increased feelings of anger and stress; 
                                and
                            (iii) neighboring communities and the 
                        environment, including through--
                                    (I) flood waters overrunning manure 
                                lagoons resulting in ecological 
                                degradation in the form of soil, 
                                surface, and groundwater contamination;
                                    (II) algae blooms; and
                                    (III) wildlife population crashes;
            (2)(A) since 2019, more than 60,000,000 poultry and 
        10,000,000 swine have been depopulated; and
            (B) those massive cullings are often conducted using 
        incredibly inhumane practices including ventilation shutdown, 
        ventilation shutdown plus, sodium nitrite poisoning, and water-
        based foaming (as those terms are defined in section 114(a));
            (3) since 2019, industrial operators put slaughterhouse 
        workers in jeopardy and cost taxpayers millions of dollars;
            (4) industrial operators continue to experience record 
        profits, including a 300-percent growth in profits during the 
        COVID-19 pandemic;
            (5) industrial operators have created a system that allows 
        for the inhumane handling of nonambulatory livestock (as 
        defined in section 3(a) of Public Law 85-765 (commonly known as 
        the ``Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1958'')) that causes 
        needless suffering, unsafe working conditions, and the spread 
        of foodborne and zoonotic diseases;
            (6) industrial operators have abused the use of certain 
        drugs that increase the risk of livestock becoming 
        nonambulatory livestock (as so defined);
            (7) slaughterhouse deregulation and decreased Federal 
        oversight of meat and poultry slaughter pose significant risks 
        to workers, consumers, and animals;
            (8) Federal humane slaughter laws currently exempt 98 
        percent of animals slaughtered for food;
            (9) current Federal animal transport laws are ineffective 
        and inherently cruel; and
            (10) Federal support is needed to create a level playing 
        field for farmers engaged in higher-welfare practices who are 
        struggling to compete in a highly monopolized market controlled 
        by industrial operators.

8520,7585,H.R.552,Health,"Second Chance at Life Act of 2021
This bill requires abortion providers to disclose information about the possibility of reversing a medication abortion. This is a procedure that uses a medication regimen to terminate a pregnancy, typically with a two-drug protocol.
Providers must inform patients that it may be possible to reverse the effects of a medication abortion after taking the first drug. They must also let patients know that more information and assistance is available on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) website. At least 24 hours before the procedure, the provider must share this information with the patient in person or by telephone. The provider must also include the information in written discharge instructions after the first drug is dispensed.
The bill sets out an exception to these notification requirements when an abortion is necessary to resolve a physical injury or condition that threatens the life of the woman. The provider must document the circumstances giving rise to the exception in the patient's medical file.
Furthermore, providers must post signs with this information in their offices or facilities, and HHS must maintain information about reversing medication abortions on its website.","To ensure that a woman seeking a chemical abortion is informed that it 
may be possible to reverse the intended effects of the abortion if the 
            woman changes her mind, and for other purposes.

SEC. 4. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The majority of recent emerging infectious diseases 
        have originated in wildlife.
            (2) There is a rise in the frequency of zoonotic spillover 
        events and outbreaks of such diseases.
            (3) This rise in such spillover events and outbreaks 
        relates to the increased interaction between humans and 
        wildlife.
            (4) There is a progressive and increasing rise in 
        interaction between human populations and wildlife related to 
        deforestation, habitat degradation, and expansion of human 
        activity into the habitat of such wildlife.
            (5) The increase in such interactions due to these factors, 
        particularly in forested regions of tropical countries where 
        there is high mammalian diversity, is a serious risk factor for 
        spillover events.
            (6) A serious risk factor for spillover events also relates 
        to the collection, production, commercial trade, and sale for 
        human consumption of wildlife that may transmit to zoonotic 
        pathogens to humans that may then replicate and be transmitted 
        within the human population.
            (7) Such a risk factor is increased if it involves wildlife 
        that--
                    (A) does not ordinarily interact with humans; or
                    (B) lives under a stressful condition, as such 
                condition exacerbates the shedding of zoonotic 
                pathogens.
            (8) Markets for such wildlife to be sold for human 
        consumption are found in many countries.
            (9) In some communities, such wildlife may be the only 
        accessible source of high quality nutrition.
            (10) The public health emergency has resulted in--
                    (A) trillions of dollars in economic damage to the 
                United States; and
                    (B) the deaths of hundreds of thousands of American 
                citizens.

                of intact forests and other intact ecosystems and 
                biodiversity strongholds, including activities carried 
                out by governments, private sector entities, and 
                multilateral development financial institutions;
            (3) to offer alternative livelihood and worker training 
        programs and enterprise development to wildlife traders, 
        wildlife breeders, and local communities whose members are 
        engaged in the commercial wildlife trade for human consumption;
            (4) to work with indigenous peoples and local communities--
                    (A) to ensure that their rights are respected and 
                their authority to exercise such rights is protected;
                    (B) to provide education and awareness regarding 
                animal handling, sanitation, and disease transmission;
                    (C) to provide sustainable wildlife management and 
                support for the development of village-level 
                alternative sources of protein and nutrition;

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Education And Training for Health 
Act of 2022'' or the ``EAT for Health Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to 2019 National Health Expenditure Account 
        data, the growth in total national healthcare expenditures in 
        2019 reached $3.8 trillion, or $11,582 per person.
            (2) According to the Center for Disease Control and 
        Prevention (CDC) around 90 percent of annual health 
        expenditures are for people with chronic and mental health 
        conditions.
            (3) According to the CDC most people in the United States 
        don't eat a healthy diet and consume too much sodium, saturated 
        fat, and sugar, increasing their risk of chronic diseases. 
        Fewer than 1 in 10 adolescents and adults eat enough fruits or 
        vegetables.
            (4) According to National Center for Chronic Disease 
        Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) six in ten Americans 
        live with at least one chronic disease, like heart disease and 
        stroke, cancer, or diabetes.
            (5) Seven out of 10 deaths among people in the United 
        States each year are from chronic diseases such as 
        cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer.
            (6) According to NCCDPHP eating healthy helps prevent, 
        delay, and manage heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and other 
        chronic diseases. (5) According to the CDC, heart disease is 
        the leading cause of death for American adults. Approximately 
        659,000 American adults die each year from cardiovascular 
        disease. Coronary heart disease alone costs American taxpayers 
        $363 billion each year.
            (7) Research has shown that following a healthful diet, 
        including a plant-based diet, can not only reduce symptoms 
        related to cardiovascular disease but can also actually reverse 
        damage done to the arteries.
            (8) According to the Journal of the American Medical 
        Association, two-thirds of adults in the United States are 
        currently overweight, and half of those overweight individuals 
        are obese. One in three children are overweight, and one-fifth 
        of children are obese. The United States spends about $147 to 
        $210 billion a year on obesity related diseases, including type 
        2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and arthritis.
            (9) An estimated 34.2 million people in the United States 
        have diabetes. Another 88 million American adults have 
        prediabetes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
        predicts that one in three children born in 2000 will develop 
        diabetes at some point in their lives. Total direct estimated 
        costs of diagnosed diabetes increased from $188 billion in 2012 
        to $237 billion in 2017.
            (10) A consensus statement endorsed by American Association 
        of Clinical Endocrinology, supported by the Academy of 
        Nutrition and Dietetics, and co-sponsored by the Endocrine 
        Society reports that plant-based diets and other nutrition 
        interventions aid type 2 diabetes remission.
            (11) According to the American Cancer Society, there will 
        be an estimated 1,918,030 new cancer cases diagnosed and 
        609,360 cancer deaths in the United States in 2022. That is 
        equivalent to about 1,670 deaths per day and accounts for 
        nearly 1 of every 4 deaths. The National Cancer Institute 
        estimates that cancer-related direct medical costs in the U.S. 
        were $183 billion in 2015 and are projected to increase to $246 
        billion by 2030, a 34% increase based only on population growth 
        and aging.
            (12) According to a 2008 survey published in Journal of the 
        American College of Nutrition, physicians felt inadequately 
        trained to provide proper nutrition advice. Ninety-four percent 
        felt nutrition counseling should be included during primary 
        care visits, but only 14 percent felt adequately trained to 
        provide such counseling.
            (13) A 1985 National Academy of Sciences report recommended 
        that all medical schools require at least 25 contact hours of 
        nutrition education. According to a 2009 national survey of 
        medical colleges published in Academic Medicine, only 38 
        percent of medical schools met these minimum standards by 
        requiring 25 hours of nutrition education as part of their 
        general curricula in 2004. By 2010, that number had shrunk to 
        27 percent.
            (14) According to the Journal of Nutrition in Clinical 
        Practice in 2010, more than half of graduating medical students 
        felt their nutrition education was insufficient.
            (15) Recognizing the importance of nutrition, Healthy 
        People 2030--the Federal Government's framework for a healthier 
        Nation--includes a goal (NWS-05) to increase the proportion of 
        health care visits by adults with obesity that include 
        counseling or education related to nutrition, weight loss, or 
        physical activity. According to Healthy People 2030, only 24.8 
        percent of physician office visits included counseling about 
        nutrition or diet in 2016.
            (16) According to Mission: Readiness, obesity disqualifies 
        31 percent of youth from serving if they so choose.
            (17) According to the Journal of American Health Promotion, 
        the military spends well over $1 billion a year to treat 
        weight-related health problems such as heart disease and 
        diabetes through its TRICARE health insurance for active duty 
        personnel, reservists, retirees and their families.
            (18) According to the Department of Health and Human 
        Services, racial and ethnic minority groups experience higher 
        rates of chronic health conditions, including diabetes, 
        hypertension, obesity, heart disease, and cancer when compared 
        to their White counterparts due to Social Determinants of 
        Health, including lack of access to nutritious food.

SEC. 3. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES GUIDELINES, AND FEDERAL 
              AGENCIES ANNUAL REPORTS, RELATING TO CERTAIN PRIMARY CARE

to which the agency has adopted and encouraged the guidelines issued 
under subsection (a) with respect to such professionals employed by 
such agency during any portion of the previous year. If the agency, 
with respect to such previous year, did not fully adopt and encourage 
such guidelines with respect to such professionals, the head of the 
agency shall include in the report for the year the percentage of such 
professionals employed by such agency to furnish primary care services 
who completed continuing education courses relating to nutrition (as 
described in subsection (c)).
    (c) Continuing Education Relating to Nutrition.--For purposes of 
subsections (a) and (b), continuing education courses relating to 
nutrition shall include at least content on the role of nutrition, in

        Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(aa)(5)).
            (3) Physician.--The term ``physician'' has the meaning 
        given such term in section 1861(r)(1) of the Social Security 
        Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(r)(1)).
            (4) Primary care health professional.--The term ``primary 
        care health professional'' means a physician or nurse 
        practitioner who furnishes primary care services.
            (5) Primary care services.--The term ``primary care 
        services'' has the meaning given such term in section 
        1842(i)(4) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395u(i)(4)),

This bill makes a series of changes relating to the prices of prescription drugs under the Medicare prescription drug benefit and Medicare Advantage (MA) prescription drug plans (PDPs).
Under current law, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) may neither negotiate the prices of covered drugs nor establish a formulary. The bill repeals these restrictions and instead specifically requires the CMS to (1) negotiate the prices of covered drugs; and (2) either establish a formulary for covered drugs, or require changes to PDP formularies that take into account CMS negotiations.
If the CMS is unable to negotiate an appropriate price for a drug in accordance with certain criteria, the price must be the lowest of three specified options (e.g., the median price in other countries). The CMS must identify drugs that are subject to negotiation, with priority given to certain categories of drugs based on usage and cost.
Additionally, drug manufacturers must issue rebates to the CMS for drugs dispensed to eligible low-income individuals. Subject to civil monetary penalties, a Medicare or MA PDP sponsor must report, both to drug manufacturers and to the CMS, specified information related to the determination and payment of such rebates.","To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for the

8988,11423,H.R.404,Public Lands and Natural Resources,"Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act
This bill addresses certain driftnet fishing. Driftnet fishing is a method of fishing in which a gillnet composed of a panel or panels of webbing, or a series of such gillnets, is placed in the water and allowed to drift with the currents and winds for the purpose of entangling fish in the webbing.
Currently, the use of large-scale drift gillnets with a total length of 2.5 kilometers or more is prohibited in the United States.	The bill expands the definition of large-scale driftnet fishing to prohibit the use of gillnets with a mesh size of 14 inches or greater. This expanded prohibition does not apply within the U.S. exclusive economic zone for five years.
The Department of Commerce must conduct a transition program to facilitate the phase out of large-scale driftnet fishing and to promote the adoption of alternative fishing practices that minimize the incidental catch of living marine resources.
Commerce must award grants to program participants.
Further, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council may recommend and Commerce may approve regulations to collect fees from charter vessel operators that guide recreational anglers who harvest Pacific halibut.","To improve the management of driftnet fishing.

            (1) determines such use is not feasible due to a lack of 
        domestic availability of sustainable aviation fuel or a 
        national security contingency; and
            (2) submits to the congressional defense committees notice 
        of such waiver and the reasons for such waiver.

Duckworth, Tammy",D,IL
9046,7894,H.R.6250,Labor and Employment,"Protecting America's Meatpacking Workers Act of 2021
This bill addresses workplace conditions and safety with a particular focus on meat and poultry processing establishments and makes other changes to agricultural programs and activities.
Generally, the bill provides funding through FY2027 for hiring additional Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) inspectors and related activities. It also restricts an employer's use of certain attendance policies under which a worker is assessed points for absences with progressive discipline imposed as points accumulate.
Additionally, the bill expands protections for workers who exercise their rights under occupational safety and health laws and regulations. This includes specific protections and procedures for workers of meat and poultry processing establishments.
The bill expands workplace safety and health requirements that apply to meat and poultry processing establishments, including by prohibiting waivers (subject to limited exceptions) related to line speeds and inspections. Additionally, OSHA must issue standards for these establishments that address, for example, ergonomic program management and preventing occupational exposure to COVID-19. OSHA must also (1) establish, within seven days, a process for establishments to report COVID-19 information; and (2) publish certain regulations regarding a workers' representative accompanying an OSHA inspector during inspections of an establishment.
The bill provides funding through FY2031 for, and imposes additional conditions on recipients of, grants to improve meat and poultry processing facilities. Further, the bill increases funding for a program that supports regional and local food systems. It also requires country-of-origin labeling of beef, pork, and dairy products.","To improve protections for meatpacking workers, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) meat and poultry slaughter and processing is a 
        particularly dangerous occupation, with meat and poultry 
        processing workers suffering injuries at measurably higher 
        rates than workers in other private sector industries;
            (2) meat and poultry processing workers face double the 
        rate of amputations as the average worker in private industry, 
        and injuries such as sprains, lacerations, and contusions are 
        common among poultry workers;
            (3) meat and poultry processing workers suffer from 
        musculoskeletal injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, 
        ``trigger finger'', tendinitis, rotator cuff injuries, lower 
        back injuries, and chronic pain and numbness, in numbers that 
        can exceed 50 percent of workers;
            (4) higher line speeds in meat and poultry processing 
        facilities is a recognized risk factor that leads to increased 
        risk of both laceration and musculoskeletal injuries;
            (5) meat and poultry processing work was and continues to 
        be particularly dangerous during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 
        (COVID-19) pandemic due to, among other factors--
                    (A) the easily transmissible nature of the virus 
                via aerosol and droplet;
                    (B) the close proximity of meat processing workers;
                    (C) cold conditions inside meat processing 
                facilities; and
                    (D) the pace and physical rigor of meat and poultry 
                processing work;
            (6) during the COVID-19 pandemic, covered establishments 
        have implemented policies and procedures that have--
                    (A) increased workers' risk of exposure to SARS-
                CoV-2;
                    (B) prioritized processing rates over worker health 
                and welfare; and
                    (C) caused a disparate adverse impact on Asian, 
                Black, and Latino workers in the meat and poultry 
                processing industry;
            (7) enforcement of requirements of the Occupational Safety 
        and Health Administration in the meat and poultry processing 
        industry has been fundamentally inadequate, especially during 
        the COVID-19 pandemic; and
            (8) meat and poultry processing workers are subjected to 
        exploitative conditions and abusive behavior by employers--
                    (A) including--
                            (i) use of abusive and humiliating shouting 
                        by supervisors accusing workers of not working 
                        fast enough and harassing them to work 
                        ``faster'' and ``harder'';
                            (ii) use of sexualized language to harass 
                        women workers to work ``harder'' and 
                        ``faster'';
                            (iii) patterns of direct sexual harassment 
                        and incidents of sexual assault; and
                            (iv) little or no accountability or redress 
                        for emotional, sexualized, or psychological 
                        abuse due to--
                                    (I) weak enforcement of, and 
                                noncompliance with, discrimination 
                                protections; and
                                    (II) meat and poultry processing 
                                workers not reporting the abuse due to 
                                fear of receiving more abuse, having 
                                their employment terminated, or being 
                                reported to immigration enforcement; 
                                and
                    (B) that lead to long-term psychological impacts, 
                including--
                            (i) increased feelings of anger and stress 
                        by workers pressured to work faster and more 
                        aggressively to slaughter animals on killing 
                        lines; and
                            (ii) episodes of panic and fear by workers 
                        who were required to continue working during 
                        COVID-19 outbreaks.

This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish and maintain a library or catalog of each type of contract offered by packers to producers for the purchase of all or part of the production of fed cattle (including cattle that are purchased or committed for delivery). Fed cattle means a steer or heifer that has been feeding on a ration of roughage and feed concentrates prior to slaughter, including grains, protein meal, grass, and other nutrient-rich feeds.
USDA must create and maintain a publicly available library or catalog of the types of contracts that are being offered by packers to, and are open to acceptance by, producers for the purchase of fed cattle. It must also conduct educational outreach activities for producers on how best to use the library or catalog.
Additionally, USDA must also establish (1) regional mandatory minimum thresholds to enhance price discovery and transparency for cattle market participants; and (2) methods for establishing such thresholds, which shall be publicly available.
Further, the bill revises daily reporting requirements for packer processing plants by requiring them to include the number of cattle scheduled to be delivered for slaughter each day for the subsequent 14 days.","To amend the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, to establish a cattle 
               contract library, and for other purposes.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Medical Marijuana Safe 
Harbor Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Chronic pain affects the veteran population, with 
        almost 60 percent of veterans returning from serving in the 
        Armed Forces in the Middle East, and more than 50 percent of 
        older veterans, who are using the health care system of the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs living with some form of chronic 
        pain.
            (2) In 2018, opioids accounted for approximately 70 percent 
        of all drug overdose deaths in the United States.
            (3) Veterans are twice as likely to die from opioid related 
        overdoses than nonveterans.
            (4) States with medical cannabis laws have a 24.8 percent 
        lower mean annual opioid overdose mortality rate compared with 
        States without medical cannabis laws.
            (5) Marijuana and its compounds show promise for treating a 
        wide-range of diseases and disorders, including pain 
        management.
            (6) Medical marijuana in States where it is legal may serve 
        as a less harmful alternative to opioids in treating veterans.

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Food and Agribusiness Merger 
Moratorium and Antitrust Review Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Concentration in the food and agricultural economy, 
        including mergers, acquisitions, and other combinations and 
        alliances among suppliers, packers, integrators, other food 
        processors, distributors, and retailers has been accelerating 
        at a rapid pace since the 1980s, and particularly since the 
        2007 through 2009 recession.
            (2) The trend toward greater concentration in food and 
        agriculture has important and far reaching implications not 
        only for family farmers, but also for food chain workers, the 
        food we eat, the communities we live in, the integrity of the 
        natural environment upon which we all depend, and for our 
        collective public health.
            (3) The infant formula industry, for example, has reached 
        an alarming level of corporate concentration with 4 companies 
        now controlling nearly 90 percent of the infant formula market. 
        A disruption in the supply of just 1 infant formula producer 
        now presents a grave risk to infant health in the United 
        States.
            (4) In the past 4 decades, the top 4 largest pork packers 
        have seized control of 70 percent of the market, up from 36 
        percent. Over the same period, the top 4 beef packers have 
        expanded their market share from 32 percent to 85 percent. The 
        top 4 flour millers have increased their market share from 40 
        percent to 64 percent. The market share of the top 4 soybean 
        crushers has jumped from 54 percent to 79 percent, and the top 
        4 wet corn processors control of the market has increased from 
        63 percent to 86 percent.
            (5) Today the top 4 sheep, poultry, and fluid milk 
        processors now control 62 percent, 54 percent, and 50 percent 
        of the market, respectively.
            (6) The top 4 grain companies today control as much as 90 
        percent of the global grain trade.
            (7) During the past 5 years there has been a wave of 
        consolidation among global seed and crop-chemical firms, 3 
        companies now control nearly \2/3\ of the world's commodity 
        crop seeds. Those same 3 companies now also control nearly 70 
        percent of all agricultural chemicals and pesticides.
            (8) In the United States, the 4 largest corn seed sellers 
        accounted for 85 percent of the market in 2015, up from 60 
        percent in 2000. Over the past 20 years, the cost for an acre's 
        worth of seeds for an average corn farmer has nearly 
        quadrupled, and the cost of fertilizer has more than doubled. 
        Yet corn yields increased only 36 percent over that time, and 
        the price received for the sale of a bushel of corn increased 
        only 31 percent.
            (9) A handful of firms dominate the processing of every 
        major commodity. Many of them are vertically integrated, which 
        means that they control successive stages of the food chain, 
        from inputs to production to distribution. The growing number 
        and scale of cross-border agribusiness and food mergers have 
        put foreign firms, often with considerable government backing, 
        into prominent and even dominant positions in the United States 
        beef, hog, poultry, seed, fertilizer, and agrichemical sectors.
            (10) Growing concentration of the agricultural sector has 
        restricted choices for farmers trying to sell their products. 
        As the bargaining power of agribusiness firms over farmers 
        increases, concentrated agricultural commodity markets are 
        stacked against the farmer, with buyers of agricultural 
        commodities often possessing regional dominance in the form of 
        oligopsony or monopsony relative to sellers of such 
        commodities.
            (11) The high concentration and consolidation of buyers in 
        agricultural markets has resulted in the thinning of both cash 
        and future markets, thereby allowing dominant buyers to 
        leverage their market shares to move those markets to the 
        detriment of family farmers and ranchers.
            (12) Buyers with oligopsonistic or monopsonistic power have 
        incentives to engage in unfair and discriminatory acts that 
        cause farmers to receive less than a competitive price for 
        their goods. At the same time, some Federal courts have 
        incorrectly required a plaintiff to show harm to competition 
        generally, in addition to harm to the individual farmer, when 
        making a determination that an unfair, unjustly discriminatory, 
        deceptive, or preferential act exists under the Packers and 
        Stockyards Act of 1921.
            (13) The farmer's share of every retail dollar has 
        plummeted from 41 percent in 1950, to less than 15 percent 
        today, while the profit share for farm input, marketing, and 
        processing companies has risen.
            (14) While agribusiness conglomerates are posting record 
        earnings, farmers are facing desperate times. Since 2013, net 
        farm income for United States farmers has fallen by more than 
        half and median on farm income was negative in 2020.
            (15) The benefits of low commodity prices are not being 
        passed on to American consumers. The gap between what shoppers 
        pay for food and what farmers are paid is growing wider.
            (16) The steadily rising price of food has outpaced growth 
        in incomes for typical workers. Since the Great Recession, the 
        annual growth of real prices for food at the supermarket have 
        risen nearly 3 times faster than typical earnings.
            (17) There is a growing consensus that economic 
        consolidation contributes to the widening gap in economic 
        opportunity in the United States and bigger, more dominant 
        firms are more likely to deliver profits to investors than to 
        raise wages or benefits. Mega-mergers in the food and 
        agribusiness industries can lead to growing monopsony power 
        abuse resulting in wage suppression, along with massive layoffs 
        as companies shutter factories and facilities, harming working 
        families and communities.
            (18) Concentration, low prices, anticompetitive practices, 
        and other manipulations and abuses of the agricultural economy 
        are driving small family farmers out of business. Farmers are 
        going bankrupt or giving up, and few are taking their places; 
        more farm families are having to rely on other jobs to stay 
        afloat. Seventy-nine percent of farm household income came from 
        off farm work in 2020, up from 53 percent in 1960.
            (19) Eighty-one percent of America's farmed cropland is now 
        controlled by 15 percent of farms, and the number of farmers 
        leaving the land will continue to increase unless and until 
        these trends are reversed.
            (20) The decline of small family farms undermines the 
        economies of rural communities across America; it has pushed 
        Main Street businesses, from equipment suppliers to small 
        banks, out of business or to the brink of insolvency.
            (21) Increased concentration in the agribusiness sector has 
        a harmful effect on the environment; corporate hog farming, for 
        example, threatens the integrity of local water supplies and 
        creates noxious odors in neighboring communities. Concentration 
        also can increase the risks to food safety and limit the 
        biodiversity of plants and animals.
            (22) The decline of family farming poses a direct threat to 
        American families and family values, by subjecting farm 
        families to turmoil and stress. Farm advocates across the 
        country are reporting an increase in farmer suicides over the 
        past several years.
            (23) The decline of family farming causes the demise of 
        rural communities, as stores lose customers, churches lose 
        congregations, schools and clinics become under-used, career 
        opportunities for young people dry up, and local inequalities 
        of wealth and income grow wider.
            (24) These developments are not the result of inevitable 
        market forces. Its problems arise rather from policies made in 
        Washington, including farm, antitrust, and trade policies.
            (25) Past congressional action to remediate market failure, 
        such as enacting country-of-origin labeling to provide 
        transparency for domestic farmers, ranchers, and consumers 
        regarding agricultural commodity origins, have been overturned 
        for key commodities by oligopolistic conglomerates that use 
        undifferentiated imports to reduce domestic farm prices.
            (26) To restore competition in the agricultural economy, 
        and to increase the bargaining power and enhance economic 
        prospects for family farmers, the trend toward concentration 
        must be reversed.

        and farm inputs such as machinery, fertilizer, and seeds.
            (2) Current trends in concentration of the food and 
        agricultural sector and what this sector is likely to look like 
        in the near and longer term future.
            (3) The effects of rising concentration on suppliers, 
        workers and farmers, including independent and contract 
        farmers, with respect to--
                    (A) competition in markets for their products and 
                services;
                    (B) income and benefit levels;
                    (C) income distribution;

        environment.
            (5) The impacts of concentration in the seed industry on 
        genetic diversity in farm fields and any related impacts on 
        food security.
            (6) The impacts of this concentration upon food shoppers, 
        including the reasons that low farm prices have not resulted in 
        corresponding drops in supermarket prices.
            (7) Whether farming is approaching a scale that is larger 
        than necessary from the standpoint of productivity.
            (8) The effect of current laws and administrative practices 
        in supporting and encouraging this concentration.
            (9) Whether the existing antitrust laws provide adequate 
        safeguards against, and remedies for, the impacts of 
        concentration upon family farms, the communities they comprise, 
        and the food shoppers of this Nation.
            (10) Accurate and reliable data on the national and

        markets for the processing of agricultural commodities, such as 
        the meat packing industry.
            (12) The extent to which developments, such as packer 
        ownership of livestock, formula pricing, marketing agreements, 
        production contracting, forward contracting, and vertical 
        integration tend to give processors, agribusinesses, 
        integrators, and other buyers of agricultural commodities 
        additional market power over farmers and suppliers in local 
        markets.
            (13) The extent to which mergers cause wage suppression, 
        layoffs, or reduced benefits to workers in the food and 
        agricultural sector.
            (14) Such related matters as the Commission determines to 
        be important.

This bill expands the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and establishes programs to address food insecurity among college students.
Specifically, the bill permanently modifies the eligibility requirements to allow additional college students to receive SNAP benefits, and it establishes a demonstration program to allow college students to use SNAP benefits on college campuses instead of meal plans. The bill also advances implementation of certain data-sharing agreements and notifications to help students who apply for federal financial aid to also apply for and receive other federal means-tested benefits (e.g., Section 8 tenant-based housing assistance, Medicaid, and Supplemental Security Income).
In addition, the bill (1) requires questions about food and housing insecurity to be incorporated into the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, and (2) establishes a grant program to support research and address incidences of food and housing insecurity among college students.","To amend the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to expand the eligibility 
  of students to participate in the supplemental nutrition assistance 
   program, establish college student food insecurity demonstration 
                   programs, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

     This Act may be cited as ``Farmers Market and Food Bank Local 
Revitalization Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Food insecurity, epidemic levels of obesity, 
        hypertension, diabetes, and youth osteoporosis are caused by 
        improper nutrition yielded by lack of nutritious, reliable, and 
        locally available healthy food options.
            (2) The American Diabetes Association estimated a 41-
        percent increase in costs of diagnosed diabetes from 2007 
        ($174,000,000,000) to 2012 ($245,000,000,000) with most of 
        these costs (62 percent) coming from senior health programs 
        such as Medicare and Medicaid.
            (3) Since sequestration in 2008, there has been no funding 
        increase for the Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Program.
            (4) From 2008 to 2020, the moderate at home food cost for a 
        family of 2 (aged 51-70 years old) increased by an average of 
        $70 a month. Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Program funding 
        has not kept pace with such inflation.
            (5) According to the Department of Agriculture, Seniors 
        Farmers' Market Nutrition Program has a total program funding 
        backlog of $20,065,021 and a season benefit level backlog of 
        $16,120,741 across all participating States, territories, and 
        Native American Tribes.
            (6) Roughly 1 in 10 United States senior citizens (about 
        5,146,000) are forced to live well below the Federal poverty 
        level, and the Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Program is 
        only able to reach about 725,000 due to inadequate funding.
            (7) Since sequestration in 2008, funding for farmers' 
        market nutrition programs has fallen by over $6,000,000 and 
        never rebounded.
            (8) The farmers' market nutrition program is a vital 
        safeguard for the nearly 1 in 7 children who will be born into 
        poverty in the United States and will be at nutritional risk.
            (9) According to the Department of Agriculture, the 
        farmers' market nutrition program has a total program and 
        seasonal benefit funding backlog of $6,198,432 across all 
        participating States, territories, and Native American Tribes.
            (10) In the United States, food banks will provide meals to 
        1 in 7 people.
            (11) Many food banks share special relationships with local 
        farmers who often donate their crops to food banks. The 
        partnership allows for more efficient and sustainable 
        procurement for food banks.
            (12) Assisting food banks to grow their own food will aid 
        local procurement and allow food banks to serve as farming 
        resources to their communities, especially to those who are 
        food insecure.
            (13) The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 specifically 
        required looking at ways to incorporate local goods to reduce 
        food waste.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to increase and enhance funding for farmers' market 
        nutrition programs to support seniors, food insecure families, 
        and to increase market capacity for local farmers;
            (2) to provide funding assistance for the expansion and 
        construction of farmers markets in both rural and urban food 
        desert areas; and
            (3) to increase local food production through partnership 
        with food banks by local farmer contracting and funding 
        assistance to food banks to grow necessary produce through 
        traditional or controlled environment agricultural farming.

This bill establishes, expands, and revises multiple programs and activities of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) primarily to reduce carbon emissions from the agriculture sector.
Specifically, USDA must finalize and implement a plan to achieve net-zero emissions from the sector by 2040. USDA must periodically review and revise the plan, as necessary, and annually report on its implementation.
Additionally, the bill expands the scope of various USDA research, extension, and education programs; conservation programs; and livestock programs to incorporate climate change adaption and mitigation. Expanded activities include efforts to improve soil health and preserve farmland and grassland.
Further, the bill changes programs that support renewable energy in rural areas to address carbon emissions in the agriculture sector. Among these changes, the bill provides statutory authority for a program for reducing methane emissions from livestock waste that is carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency and transitions the program to USDA.
The bill also addresses food waste, for example, by (1) standardizing the voluntary labels used by food producers to indicate the date by which food should be used or discarded, and (2) making composting activities eligible for support through USDA conservation programs. Moreover, the bill establishes grants to reduce and prevent food waste in landfills and in schools.","To address the impact of climate change on agriculture, and for other 
                               purposes.

                         TITLE I--NATIONAL GOAL

SEC. 101. GOALS.

    (a) United States Agriculture Goal.--As part of a national 
greenhouse gas emission reduction effort to prevent climate change from 
exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above preindustrial levels, 
the goal for the agricultural sector in the United States shall be to 
achieve at least a 50 percent reduction in net greenhouse gases from 
2010 levels by not later than 2030 and to achieve net zero emissions by 
not later than 2040.
    (b) Subgoals.--
            (1) Research.--To help achieve the goal specified in 
        subsection (a), the total Federal investment in public food and 
        agriculture research and extension should, at a minimum, triple 
        by not later than 2030 and quadruple by not later than 2040, 
        with a heightened emphasis on climate change adaptation and 
        mitigation, soil health and carbon sequestration, nutrient and 
        manure management to curb nitrous oxide and methane emissions, 
        agroforestry, advanced grazing management and crop-livestock 
        integration, other agro-ecological systems, on-farm and food 
        system energy efficiency and renewable energy production, 
        farmland preservation and viability, food waste reduction, and 
        related topics to accelerate progress toward net zero emissions 
        by not later than 2040.
            (2) Soil health.--To help achieve the goal specified in 
        subsection (a) the United States should--
                    (A) immediately become a member of the 4 per 1000 
                Initiative's forum and consortium, hosted by the 
                Consultative Group for International Agricultural 
                Research (commonly referred to as the ``CGIAR''), with 
                the aim of increasing total soil carbon stocks by 0.4 
                percent annually to reduce carbon in the atmosphere, 
                restore soil health and productivity, and thereby 
                improve food security;
                    (B) expand adoption of soil health practices 
                (including diverse crop rotations, cover cropping, 
                conservation tillage, perennial crop production 
                systems, agroforestry, composting, biologically based 
                nutrient management, and advanced grazing management 
                including silvopasture) sufficiently to--

                        by not later than 2040; and
                            (ii) increase soil carbon stocks by 0.4 
                        percent annually on at least 50 percent of 
                        United States agricultural lands by not later 
                        than 2030, and to meet or exceed that threshold 
                        on all United States agricultural lands by not 
                        later than 2040;
                    (C) expand implementation of regionally appropriate 
                cover crops and other continual living cover so that--
                            (i) at least 50 percent of cropland acres 
                        nationwide include one or more cover crops or 
                        other continual living cover in their rotations 
                        by not later than 2030, rising to at least 75 
                        percent of cropland acres nationwide by not 
                        later than 2040; and
                            (ii) cropland acres are covered by crops 
                        (including forages and hay crops), cover crops, 
                        or residue for an average of 75 percent of the 
                        calendar year by not later than 2030, rising to 
                        at least 85 percent of the calendar year by not 
                        later than 2040; and
                    (D) encourage conversion of at least 15 percent of 
                current annual grain crop acres to agroforestry, 
                perennial grazing, perennial grain crops, or other 
                perennial production systems by not later than 2030, 
                rising to at least 30 percent by not later than 2040.
            (3) Farmland preservation.--To help achieve the goal 
        specified in subsection (a), the rate of conversion in the 
        United States of agricultural land to development, as well as 
        the rate of grassland conversion to cropping, should be reduced 
        by at least 80 percent by not later than 2030 and eliminated by 
        not later than 2040.
            (4) Pasture-based livestock.--To help achieve the goal 
        specified in subsection (a), the livestock sector in the United 
        States should--
                    (A) establish advanced grazing management, 
                including management-intensive rotational grazing, on 
                at least 50 percent of all grazing lands by not later 
                than 2030 and 100 percent of all grazing land by not 
                later than 2040;
                    (B) reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to 
                feeding of ruminants by at least a third by not later 
                than 2030 and by at least 50 percent by not later than 
                2040 by reducing non-grazing feeding of ruminants, 
                growing feed grains and forages with soil health and 
                nutrient management practices that minimize net 
                greenhouse gas emissions from cropland, and designing 
                livestock feed mixtures and supplements to mitigate 
                enteric methane emissions;
                    (C) re-integrate livestock and crop production 
                systems at farm, local and regional levels to 
                facilitate environmentally sound management and field 
                application of manure and reduce the need for long-term 
                manure storage by increasing acreage on individual 
                farms under crop-livestock integrated management by at 
                least 100 percent over 2017 levels by not later than 
                2030 and by 300 percent over 2017 levels by not later 
                than 2040; and

            ``(1) Pasture-based management.--The term `pasture-based 
        management' means a dairy or livestock production system in 
        which the animals spend all or a substantial portion of their 
        time grazing on fields in which some or all of the manure is 
        deposited and left in the field and decomposes aerobically.
            ``(2) Non-digester dairy or livestock methane management 
        method.--The term `non-digester dairy or livestock methane 
        management method' means a method that may be used by operators 
        of dairy or livestock operations to transition from wet manure 
        handling and storage, where anaerobic conditions are present, 
        to dry manure handling and storage, including open solar drying 
        or composting of manure onsite, conversion of dairy and 
        livestock operations to pasture-based management, solid 
        separation technologies, scrape conversion, and other 
        strategies to mitigate methane emissions from manure 
        management, as determined by the Secretary.
            ``(3) Onsite open solar drying or composting of manure.--
        The term `onsite open solar drying or composting of manure'

        technologies for manure management.
            ``(5) Solid separation technologies.--The term `solid 
        separation technologies' means technologies designed to 
        separate liquid components of manure from mineral and organic 
        solid components, for the purposes of reducing methane 
        emissions.
            ``(6) Eligible producer.--The term `eligible producer' 
        means a dairy or livestock producer whose baseline manure 
        management practices prior to enrollment in the program include 
        the anaerobic decomposition of volatile solids stored in a 
        lagoon or other predominantly liquid anaerobic environment.
    ``(b) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish an alternative 
manure management program to support non-digester dairy and livestock 
methane management strategies to effectively reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and to maximize environmental benefits.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Certain cetaceans, namely orcas, beluga whales, false 
        killer whales, and pilot whales are large-brained mammals who 
        engage in creative problem solving, intentional communication, 
        show signs of empathy for others and complex emotions, and form 
        lifelong bonds.
            (2) Science increasingly supports that the species listed 
        in paragraph (1) suffer in captivity. They die prematurely, 
        engage in stereotypic behavior that is indicative of suffering 
        and distress, are held in barren tanks, and are sometimes 
        isolated from members of their own species, among other harms.
            (3) Current Federal laws allow the species listed in 
        paragraph (1) to be confined in concrete tanks that fail to 
        meet their basic psychological, physical, and social needs.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
species listed in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) should not be subject 
to restraint, coercion, or control by any person for purposes of public 
display.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON EXPORTATION, TAKING, AND IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN 
              CETACEANS.

    (a) Prohibition on Exportation.--Section 102 of the Marine Mammal 
Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1372(a)) is amended by adding at the 
end the following new subsection:
    ``(g)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, it is unlawful 
to export any orca, beluga whale, false killer whale, or pilot whale 
except for the transport of such species--
            ``(A) to a marine mammal sanctuary with a determination by 
        the Secretary that the transportation to such sanctuary is in 
        the best interest of the individual marine mammal; or
            ``(B) for release to the wild.
    ``(2) In this subsection, the term `sanctuary' means a place of 
refuge where marine mammals--
            ``(A) live in a captive setting as close as possible to 
        their natural environment;
            ``(B) are prioritized individually with respect to well-
        being and autonomy; and
            ``(C) are not used for profit or breeding for the purpose 
        of public display.''.
    (b) Prohibition on Permits for Taking or Importation.--Section 
104(a) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1374(a)) 
is amended to read as follows:
    ``(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary may 
issue permits which authorize the taking or importation of any marine 
mammal.
    ``(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may 
not issue any permit that authorizes the taking or importation of any 
orca, beluga whale, false killer whale, or pilot whale for the purpose 
of public display.
    ``(3) The Secretary may issue permits for the incidental taking of 
marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing operations only as 
specifically provided for in section 101(a)(5) or 306, or subsection 
(h) of this section.''.

SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON BREEDING OF CERTAIN CETACEANS.

    The Animal Welfare Act (17 U.S.C. 2131 et seq.) is amended by 
adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 30. BREEDING OF CERTAIN CETACEANS.

    ``It shall be unlawful for any person to breed or artificially 
inseminate any orca, beluga whale, false killer whale, or pilot whale 
for purposes of using the progeny of such species for public 
display.''.

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Traveling Exotic Animal and Public 
Safety Protection Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) conditions inherent to traveling performances, 
        including constant travel, temporary and collapsible 
        facilities, and the prolonged confinement and physical coercion 
        of animals, subject exotic and wild animals to compromised 
        welfare and chronic stress, and present public and worker 
        health and safety risks not adequately addressed by current 
        regulations;
            (2) current regulatory oversight of traveling performances 
        is complex and costly, and those costs are not typically 
        recouped via licensing fees but are left to the taxpayer;
            (3) the frequent mobility of traveling performances 
        complicates oversight such that agencies and authorities cannot 
        properly monitor, evaluate, or follow through regarding the 
        condition of animals or facilities, or their history of 
        potential injuries, incidents, illnesses, violations, or other 
        issues, and so cannot properly protect animals, workers, or the 
        public;
            (4) traveling exotic and wild animal performances use 
        collapsible, temporary, mobile facilities, which risk escape 
        and serious harm to animals, workers, and the public;
            (5) traveling exotic and wild animal performances present 
        safety risks by permitting or not preventing public contact and 
        by displaying animals in inappropriate, uncontrolled areas in 
        dangerous proximity to humans and other animals;
            (6) exotic and wild animals have intrinsic value;
            (7) the wild instincts and needs of exotic and wild animals 
        are unpredictable and not naturally suited to traveling 
        performances, and exotic and wild animals thus suffer as a 
        result of being unable to fulfill instinctive natural 
        behaviors;
            (8) exotic and wild animals used in traveling performances 
        suffer severe and extended confinement, and, deprived of 
        natural movements and behaviors, are prone to chronic stress 
        and behavioral, health, and psychological problems;
            (9) exotic and wild animals are forced to perform unnatural 
        tricks requiring extreme physical coercion, including the use 
        of food and water restrictions, electric shock devices, 
        bullhooks, metal bars, whips, shovels, pitchforks, and other 
        abuses;
            (10) it is not necessary to use exotic or wild animals in 
        traveling performances to experience the circus or similar 
        events;
            (11) using exotic or wild animals as commodities traded for 
        traveling performances adds nothing to the understanding and 
        conservation of those animals and the natural environment, and 
        actually undermines conservation efforts necessary to protect 
        threatened and endangered species;
            (12) it is not possible to provide or ensure public and 
        worker safety or appropriate physical and mental welfare of 
        exotic and wild animals under the traveling performance 
        business model, which inherently and significantly restricts 
        the natural movements and behaviors of animals, and in which 
        abuse is prevalent and oversight problematic;
            (13) the use of exotic or wild animals in traveling 
        performances is or substantially affects interstate or foreign 
        commerce and the free flow of interstate or foreign commerce;
            (14) it is essential to regulate the use of exotic or wild 
        animals in traveling performances to ensure the humane care and 
        treatment of animals; and
            (15) restricting the use of exotic and wild animals in 
        traveling performances is the most cost-effective and efficient 
        way to safeguard animals, workers, and the public.

SEC. 3. USE OF EXOTIC OR WILD ANIMALS IN TRAVELING PERFORMANCES 
              PROHIBITED.

    Section 13 of the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2143) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsections (g) and (h) as subsections 
        (h) and (i), respectively;

        delivery of animals by a dealer, research facility, exhibitor, 
        or government) as subsection (g); and

This bill revises requirements governing the management of endangered or threatened species, establishes a process to compensate land owners under certain circumstances, and removes protections for black vultures and ravens.
The Department of the Interior or the Department of Commerce must obtain the consent of each state for adding species to the list of threatened or endangered species when the species is present in the state.
A state may regulate endangered or threatened species that are only present within the state. If a state elects to regulate them, it is given exclusive authority to manage them. State action with respect to such species is not subject to judicial review.
Species are taken off the federal list after five years, but Interior may petition for the species to be relisted. The bill requires congressional approval before a species may be listed as endangered or threatened.
The bill eliminates awards of attorney fees in citizen suits concerning endangered or threatened species.
Owners or lessees of property may apply to Interior for a determination of whether a proposed property use will violate requirements governing endangered or threatened species. The use is deemed compliant if Interior fails to respond within 90 days. The owners and lessees may seek monetary compensation for unfavorable determinations.
The bill removes migratory bird protections provided to black vultures and ravens in certain circumstances.","To amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to permit Governors of

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Endangered Species Management Self-
Determination Act''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF ESA.

    In this Act, the term ``ESA'' means the Endangered Species Act of 
1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the ESA was passed in 1973 as a means of protecting and 
        recovering species and has not been substantially revised in 
        over 25 years;
            (2) the ESA has not achieved its stated goal of recovering 
        threatened species or endangered species;
            (3) of the species listed in accordance with the ESA, less 
        than 1 percent of the total number of species in the United 
        States have been recovered and removed from the list, largely 
        due to data errors or other factors;
            (4) there is--
                    (A) no comprehensive independent study of the costs 
                or benefits of the ESA;
                    (B) no full accounting of how much the Federal 
                Government and State and local governments spend to 
                implement, enforce, and comply with the ESA; and
                    (C) no meaningful effort to account for the costs 
                the ESA imposes on the private sector;
            (5) the ESA effectively penalizes landowners for owning 
        endangered species habitat by forcing them to bear the cost of 
        conservation;
            (6) the regulatory listing process under the ESA has become 
        a tool for environmentalists to undermine, slow down, or halt 
        construction of infrastructure projects, hampering economic 
        growth and employment; and
            (7) litigation stemming from the ESA and some resulting 
        settlements between the litigants and the Federal Government 
        have made the ESA even more unworkable, to the detriment of 
        species.

SEC. 4. AMENDMENTS TO THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT OF 1973.

    (a) Determinations of Endangered Species and Threatened Species.--

10295,372,S.908,Health,"Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Act
This bill makes a series of changes relating to the prices of prescription drugs under the Medicare prescription drug benefit and Medicare Advantage (MA) prescription drug plans (PDPs).
Under current law, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) may neither negotiate the prices of covered drugs nor establish a formulary. The bill repeals these restrictions and instead specifically requires the CMS to (1) negotiate the prices of covered drugs; and (2) either establish a formulary for covered drugs, or require changes to PDP formularies that take into account CMS negotiations.
If the CMS is unable to negotiate an appropriate price for a drug in accordance with certain criteria, the price must be the lowest of three specified options (e.g., the median price in other countries). The CMS must identify drugs that are subject to negotiation, with priority given to certain categories of drugs based on usage and cost.
Additionally, drug manufacturers must issue rebates to the CMS for drugs dispensed to eligible low-income individuals. Subject to civil monetary penalties, a Medicare or MA PDP sponsor must report, both to drug manufacturers and to the CMS, specified information related to the determination and payment of such rebates.","To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Sustainable Investment Policies Act 
of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Environmental, social, and governance (in this Act 
        referred to as ``ESG'') include the potential for economic 
        benefits, such as local job creation and economic development, 
        in addition to investment returns, as provided by investments 
        sometimes referred to as ``Economically Targeted Investments'' 
        or ``ETIs''.
            (2) There is now incontrovertible evidence that ESG factors 
        can have substantial effects on investment performance and are 
        important to many investors and that investors have a 
        significant interest in such findings.
            (3) Investor findings show a dramatic interest in 
        investments that consider ESG factors.
            (4) Decades of policy interpretations from the Department 
        of Labor and the Securities and Exchange Commission have 
        created confusion as to the obligations of a fiduciary with 
        regard to ESG intergration.
            (5) Recent policies of the Securities and Exchange 
        Commission have had a chilling effect on ESG integration and 
        active ownership with a view toward advancing a sustainable 
        economy.

                    (A) energy costs for homeowners are a significant 
                and increasing portion of their household budgets;
                    (B) household energy use can vary substantially 
                depending on the efficiency and renewable energy 
                generation characteristics of a house;
                    (C) expected energy cost savings resulting from 
                efficiency measures and/or the generation of energy 
                from solar panels and/or other renewables are in many 
                cases important to the value of a house; and
                    (D) the ``loan-to-value'' ratio test for 
                originations of covered loans is tied to the appraisal 
                or other valuation of a property of a house, which 
                often does not adjust for the energy efficiency or 
                renewable energy generation features of a house.
            (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to--
                    (A) improve the credibility and reliability of 
                appraisals of houses subject to covered loans by 
                ensuring that the energy efficient and renewable energy 
                generation features and energy costs of those houses 
                are included in the appraisal analysis, which would 
                place value on energy efficient and renewable energy 
                features of a house and facilitate the creation of 
                energy efficiency retrofit, renewable installation, and 
                construction jobs; and
                    (B) require the Secretary to--
                            (i) develop consistent enhanced energy 
                        appraisal protocols that recognize all 
                        applicable approaches to the value of a house, 
                        including the cost and income approaches to 
                        value, in analyzing energy efficiency and 
                        renewable energy features;
                            (ii) ensure that the guidelines described 
                        in clause (i) prevent the double counting of 
                        energy cost savings in the valuation of a 
                        house;
                            (iii) support safe and sound lending; and
                            (iv) protect consumers.
    (c) Enhanced Energy Appraisal Criteria.--

        required under paragraph (1)(A) shall--
                    (A) include a requirement that if a homeowner 
                voluntarily opts for an energy report to be used in 
                valuing the home, then using methods to be established 
                under the guidelines issued under paragraph (1)--
                            (i) such report may be used by a qualified 
                        appraiser to determine the estimated energy 
                        savings of the subject property in comparison 
                        to a baseline;
                            (ii) the value of estimated energy savings 
                        and energy generation of the subject property 
                        shall be added to the appraised value of the 
                        subject property, unless the appraisal includes 
                        the value of the overall energy efficiency and 
                        renewable energy generation of the subject 
                        property; and
                    (B) the cost and income approaches to value be 
                recognized as reasonable and appropriate approaches to 
                valuing the energy efficiency and renewable energy 
                features of a home; and
                    (C) prohibit restrictions of all applicable

            (3) Determination of estimated energy savings and 
        generation.--
                    (A) Amount of energy savings.--For the purpose of 
                paragraph (2), the amount of estimated energy savings 
                of a subject property shall be determined by 
                calculating the difference between the estimated energy 
                costs from the energy report for the subject property 
                compared to the energy costs of comparable houses, as 
                determined in the guidelines issued under paragraph (1)
                    (B) Amount of energy generation.--For the purpose 
                of paragraph (2), the amount of estimated energy 
                generation of a subject property shall be determined by 
                calculating the amount of energy generated by the 
                home's energy-generating features over their useful 
                lifetime.
                    (C) Duration of energy savings and generation.--For 
                the purpose of paragraph (2), the duration of the 
                estimated energy savings and generation of a subject 
                property shall be based on the useful life of 
                applicable equipment, consistent with the rating system 
                used to produce the energy report.
                    (D) Present value of energy savings and 
                generation.--For the purpose of paragraph (2), the 
                present value of the estimated future energy savings 
                and/or generation of a subject property shall be 
                calculated using the average interest rate of 
                conventional 30 year mortgages unless the qualified 
                appraiser chooses to use the appropriate discount rate 
                for the market area, in the manner directed by 
                guidelines issued under paragraph (1).
            (5) Transactions requiring state certified and competent 
        appraisers.--Section 1113 of the Financial Institutions Reform, 
        Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (12 U.S.C. 3342) is 
        amended--

of animal cruelty, for the rehabilitation of perpetrators and the 
prevention of future acts of animal cruelty or violence against humans, 
and specifically, for the purposes of--
            (1) training law enforcement officers, judges, other court

            (4) developing, installing, or expanding data collection 
        and communication systems, including computerized systems, 
        linking police, prosecutors, and courts, or for the purpose of

        protecting the national security of the United States, observed 
        as early as 1990 that climate change threatens our military 
        readiness.
            (2) As of 2019, the Department of Defense is the single 
        largest consumer of energy in the United States, and the single 
        largest institutional consumer of petroleum in the world.
            (3) Since 2001, the Department of Defense has consistently 
        consumed between 77 and 80 percent of all energy consumption of 
        the United States Government.
            (4) As climate change brings more extreme weather, water 
        and soil stress, sea-level rise, ocean acidification, glacial 
        melt, and pollution, greater global tensions over food and 
        water insecurity, resource scarcity, living patterns, and 
        climate-related migration will emerge.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that any unobligated amounts for the 
Energy Resilience and Conservation Investment Program of the Department 
of Defense at the end of fiscal year 2022 should remain available for 
obligation by the Department after such fiscal year for deserving 
projects so that the Department is able to appropriately vet those 
projects while increasing staffing.

Bear Conservation Fund Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States Fish and Wildlife Service estimates 
        that the polar bear population is currently at 20,000 to 25,000 
        bears, up from as low as 5,000 to 10,000 bears in the 1950s and 
        1960s.
            (2) A 2002 United States Geological Survey of wildlife in 
        the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Coastal Plain noted that 
        the polar bear populations ``may now be near historic highs''.
            (3) A permit fee for importing polar bears will invigorate 
        the public-private funding partnership for the United States-
        Russian Polar Bear Conservation Fund.
            (4) TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, has 
        stated both that ``the global population of Polar Bears is not 
        small and the species' area of distribution is not 
        restricted,'' and ``[t]rade does not appear to be a significant 
        threat to the species.''. TRAFFIC also recommended that the 
        polar bear not be uplisted to appendix 1 at the 16th Conference 
        of the Parties of the Convention on International Trade of 
        Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES).
            (5) The International Union for Conservation of Nature 
        (IUCN)/Species Survival Commission (SSC) Polar Bear Specialist 
        Group (PBSG), has stated that further trade restrictions on the 
        polar bear are ``unlikely to confer a conservation benefit, and 
        could have a negative impact on socioeconomic systems as well 
        as domestic and international partnerships''.
            (6) The International Union for Conservation of Nature has 
        found that ``hunting is a form of wildlife use that, when well-
        managed, may assist in furthering conservation objectives by 
        creating the revenue and economic incentives for the management 
        and conservation of the target species and its habitat, as well 
        as supporting local livelihoods''.

SEC. 3. PERMITS FOR IMPORTATION OF POLAR BEAR TROPHIES.

    The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 is amended--
            (1) in section 101(a)(3)(B) (16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(3)(B)), by 
        inserting ``or under section 104(c)(5) of this title'' after 
        ``paragraph (5) of this subsection''; and
            (2) in section 102(b)(3) (16 U.S.C. 1372(b)(3)), by 
        inserting before the semicolon the following: ``, except that 
        this paragraph does not prohibit the importation of polar bear 
        parts under a permit issued under section 104(c)(5) of this 
        title''.

This bill addresses climate change risk and its potential impact on the financial system.
The Federal Reserve Board must develop financial risk analyses relating to climate change for specified large nonbank financial companies and bank holding companies. Specifically, these entities will be evaluated every two years on whether they have the capital necessary to absorb financial losses that would arise under several different climate change risk scenarios.
The bill also establishes the Climate Risk Scenario Technical Development Group to provide recommendations to the board regarding such climate change risk scenarios, and determine the financial and economic risks of these scenarios.
The Financial Stability Oversight Council of the Department of the Treasury must establish a committee to assist it in identifying risks and responding to threats to the financial system as a result of climate change.","To require the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, in 
  consultation with the heads of other relevant Federal agencies, to 
develop and conduct financial risk analyses relating to climate change,

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Change Financial Risk Act of 
2021''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) if current trends continue, average global temperatures 
        are likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial 
        levels between 2030 and 2050;
            (2) global temperature rise has already resulted in an 
        increased number of heavy rainstorms, coastal flooding events, 
        heat waves, wildfires, and other extreme events;
            (3) since 1980--
                    (A) the number of extreme weather events per year 
                that cost the people of the United States more than 
                $1,000,000,000 per event, accounting for inflation, has 
                increased significantly; and
                    (B) the total cost of extreme weather events in the 
                United States has exceeded $1,875,000,000,000;
            (4) as physical impacts from climate change are manifested 
        across multiple sectors of the economy of the United States--
                    (A) climate-related economic risks will continue to 
                increase;
                    (B) climate-related extreme weather events will 
                disrupt energy and transportation systems in the United 
                States, which will result in more frequent and longer-
                lasting power outages, fuel shortages, and service 
                disruptions in critical sectors across the economy of 
                the United States;
                    (C) projected increases in extreme heat conditions 
                will lead to decreases in labor productivity in 
                agriculture, construction, and other critical economic 
                sectors;
                    (D) food and livestock production will be impacted 
                in regions that experience increases in heat and 
                drought and small rural communities will struggle to 
                find the resources needed to adapt to those changes; 
                and
                    (E) sea level rise and more frequent and intense 
                extreme weather events will--
                            (i) increasingly disrupt and damage private 
                        property and critical infrastructure; and
                            (ii) drastically increase insured and 
                        uninsured losses;
            (5) advances in energy efficiency and renewable energy 
        technologies, as well as climate policies and shifting societal 
        preferences, will--
                    (A) reduce global demand for fossil fuels; and
                    (B) expose transition risks for fossil fuel 
                companies and investors, and for companies and 
                investors in other energy-intensive industries, which 
                could include trillions of dollars of stranded assets 
                around the world;
            (6) climate change poses uniquely far-reaching risks to the 
        financial services industry, including with respect to credit, 
        counterparty, and market risks, due to the number of sectors 
        and locations impacted and the potentially irreversible scale 
        of damage;
            (7) financial institutions must take a consistent approach 
        to assessing climate-related financial risks and incorporating 
        those risks into existing risk management practices, which 
        should be informed by scenario analysis;
            (8) the Board of Governors conducts annual assessments of 
        the capital adequacy and capital planning practices of the 
        largest and most complex banking organizations (referred to in 
        this section as ``stress tests'') in order to promote a safe, 
        sound, and efficient banking and financial system;
            (9) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the stress 
        tests conducted by the Board of Governors are not designed to 
        reflect the physical risks or transition risks posed by climate 
        change;
            (10) the Board of Governors--
                    (A) has the authority to take into account the 
                potentially systemic impact of climate-related risks on 
                the financial system; and
                    (B) should develop new analytical tools with longer 
                time horizons to accurately assess and manage the risks 
                described in subparagraph (A); and
            (11) the Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee of the 
        Commodity Futures Trading Commission has identified the 
        importance of researching ``climate-related `sub-systemic' 
        shocks to financial markets and institutions in particular 
        sectors and regions of the United States''.

SEC. 5. DEVELOPMENT AND UPDATING OF CLIMATE CHANGE RISK SCENARIOS.

    (a) In General.--
            (1) Initial development.--Not later than 1 year after the 
        date of enactment of this Act, the Board of Governors, in 
        coordination with the climate science leads, and taking into 
        consideration the recommendations of the Technical Development 
        Group, shall develop 3 separate climate change risk scenarios 
        as follows:
                    (A) One scenario that assumes an average increase 
                in global temperatures of 1.5 degrees Celsius above 
                pre-industrial levels.
                    (B) One scenario that assumes an average increase 
                in global temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-
                industrial levels.
                    (C) One scenario that--
                            (i) assumes the likely and very likely 
                        average increase in global temperatures that 
                        can be expected, taking into consideration the 
                        extent to which national policies and actions 
                        relating to climate change have been 
                        implemented, as of the date on which the 
                        scenario is developed, or on which the scenario 
                        is updated under paragraph (2), as applicable; 
                        and
                            (ii) does not take into consideration 
                        commitments for policies and actions relating 
                        to climate change that, as of the applicable 
                        date described in clause (i), have not been 
                        implemented.
            (2) Updates.--After the initial development of the climate 
        change risk scenarios under paragraph (1), the Board of 
        Governors, in coordination with the climate science leads, and 
        taking into consideration the recommendations of the Technical 
        Development Group, shall update those scenarios once every 3 
        years.
            (3) International coordination.--In developing and updating 
        the 3 scenarios required under this subsection, the Board of 
        Governors shall take into consideration analytic tools and best 
        practices developed by international banking supervisors 
        relating to climate risks and scenario analysis in an effort to 
        develop consistent and comparable data-driven scenarios.
            (4) Recommendations.--If the Technical Development Group 
        determines that the average increase in global temperatures 
        described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) is no 
        longer scientifically valid, the Technical Development Group 
        may recommend that the Board of Governors, in coordination with 
        the climate science leads, update the average increase in 
        global temperatures described in the applicable subparagraph to 
        reflect the most current assessment of climate change science.
    (b) Considerations.--In developing and updating each of the 3 
scenarios required under subsection (a), the Board of Governors, in 
coordination with the climate science leads, shall account for physical 
risks and transition risks that may disrupt business operations across 
the global economy, including through--
            (1) disruptions with respect to--
                    (A) the sourcing of materials;
                    (B) production; and
                    (C) the disposal of products and services;
            (2) changes in the availability and prices of raw materials 
        and other inputs;
            (3) changes in agricultural production and with respect to 
        food security;
            (4) direct damages to fixed assets;
            (5) increases in costs associated with insured or uninsured 
        losses;
            (6) changes in asset values;
            (7) impacts on--
                    (A) aggregate demand for products and services;
                    (B) labor productivity;
                    (C) asset liquidity; and
                    (D) credit availability;
            (8) mass migration and increases in disease and mortality 
        rates;
            (9) international conflict, as such conflict relates to 
        global economic activity and output; and
            (10) changes in any other microeconomic or macroeconomic 
        condition that the Board of Governors, in coordination with the 
        climate science leads, determines to be relevant.

        agricultural banks, community banks, and other financial 
        institutions with a significant concentration of business 
        activities in certain geographical areas or industries, to 
        withstand each climate risk scenario developed under section 5; 
        and
            (2) how surveyed entities plan to make adaptations to the 
        business models and capital planning of those entities in 
        response to the risks presented in each climate change risk 
        scenario developed under section 5.

                2010 (12 U.S.C. 5365(i)(1)), as added by section 6 of 
                this Act, the Board of Governors shall administer the 
                survey developed under subsection (a) to each surveyed 
                entity.
                    (B) Assessment and report.--Not later than 18 
                months after the date on which the Board of Governors 
                completes the administration of the survey under 
                subparagraph (A), the Board of Governors shall--
                            (i) assess the responses to the survey; and
                            (ii) publicly release a report that 
                        summarizes the results of the survey, which 
                        shall include the analysis of the Board of 
                        Governors regarding whether the planned actions 
                        of the surveyed entities to which the survey 
                        was administered, in the aggregate--
                                    (I) are plausible; and
                                    (II) would be effective.
            (2) Subsequent administration.--
                    (A) In general.--After the release of the report 
                required under paragraph (1)(B)(ii), the Board of 
                Governors shall, on a biennial basis, administer to 
                each surveyed entity the survey developed under 
                subsection (a).
                    (B) Subsequent report.--Not later than 180 days 
                after the date on which each survey administered under 
                subparagraph (A) is completed, the Board of Governors 
                shall publicly release a report that summarizes the 
                results of the survey, which shall include the analysis 
                described in paragraph (1)(B)(ii).
    (c) Effect of Survey Participation.--
            (1) In general.--With respect to a surveyed entity to which 
        any survey under this section is administered--
                    (A) subject to paragraph (2), the entity shall not 
                be subject to any adverse consequence on the basis of a 
                response provided by the entity to the survey; and
                    (B) in any report released with respect to the 
                survey, the Board of Governors may not identify any 
                individual response submitted by the entity to the 
                survey.
            (2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in paragraph (1)(A) may 
        be construed to preclude the Board of Governors from pursuing 
        an enforcement action against a surveyed entity because of a 
        violation discovered by the Board of Governors during an 
        examination of the surveyed entity that is independent of a 
        survey administered under this section.

This bill establishes, expands, and revises multiple programs and activities of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) primarily to reduce carbon emissions from the agriculture sector.
Specifically, USDA must finalize and implement a plan to achieve net-zero emissions from the sector by 2040. USDA must periodically review and revise the plan, as necessary, and annually report on its implementation.
Additionally, the bill expands the scope of various USDA research, extension, and education programs; conservation programs; and livestock programs to incorporate climate change adaption and mitigation. Expanded activities include efforts to improve soil health and preserve farmland and grassland.
Further, the bill changes programs that support renewable energy in rural areas to address carbon emissions in the agriculture sector. Among these changes, the bill provides statutory authority for a program for reducing methane emissions from livestock waste that is carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency and transitions the program to USDA.
The bill also addresses food waste, for example, by (1) standardizing the voluntary labels used by food producers to indicate the date by which food should be used or discarded, and (2) making composting activities eligible for support through USDA conservation programs. Moreover, the bill establishes grants to reduce and prevent food waste in landfills and in schools.","To address the impact of climate change on agriculture, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

                        CODES OF CONDUCT OF ALL FEDERAL 
                        DEPARTMENTS AND EXECUTIVE AGENCIES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Human trafficking is inimical to every Federal agency's 
        core values and inherently harmful and dehumanizing.
            (2) Through the adoption of a Code of Conduct, Federal 
        agencies hold their personnel to similar standards that are 
        required of contractors and subcontractors of the agency under 
        Federal law.
            (3) Human trafficking is a violation of human rights and 
        against Federal law.
            (4) The United States Government seeks to deter activities 
        that would facilitate or support trafficking in persons.

    (b) Sense of Congress on Implementation of Anti-trafficking-in-
persons Policies.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  beginning not later than 18 months 
        after the date of the enactment of this Act, the head of every 
        Federal agency should incorporate a module on human trafficking 
        into its staff training requirements and menu of topics to be 
        covered in the annual ethics training of such agency;
            (2) such staff trainings should teach employees how to 
        prevent, identify, and report trafficking in persons;
            (3) Federal agencies that already provide counter 
        trafficking-in-persons training for staff should share their 
        curricula with agencies that do not have such curricula;
            (4) the head of each agency should inform all candidates for 
        employment about the anti-trafficking provisions in the Code of 
        Conduct of the agency;
            (5) employees of each Federal agency should sign 
        acknowledgment of the agency's Code of Conduct, which should be 
        kept in the file of the employee; and
            (6) a violation of the Code of Conduct should lead to 
        disciplinary action, up to and including termination of 
        employment.

    (c) <<NOTE: President. Requirements.>>  Policy for Executive Branch 
Employees.--The President shall take such steps as may be necessary to 
ensure that each officer and employee (including temporary employees, 
persons stationed abroad while working for the United States, and 
detailees from other agencies of the Federal Government) of an agency in

[[Page 136 STAT. 6218]]

the executive branch of the Federal Government is subject to a policy 
with a minimum standard that contains--
            (1) a prohibition from engaging in human trafficking while 
        employed by the Government in a full-time or part-time capacity;
            (2) a requirement that all Federal personnel, without regard 
        to whether the person is stationed abroad, be sensitized to 
        human trafficking and the ethical conduct requirements that

        required.--In the case of a State plan under part E of title IV 
        of the Social Security Act which the Secretary of Health and

        legislation appropriating funds) in order for the plan to meet 
        the additional requirements imposed by the amendment made by 
        subsection (a), the State plan shall not be regarded as failing 
        to comply with the requirements of such part solely on the basis 
        of the failure of the plan to meet such additional requirements 
        before the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning 
        after the close of the first regular session of the State 
        legislature that begins after the date of enactment of this Act. 
        For purposes of the previous sentence, in the case of a State 
        that has a 2-year legislative session, each year of the session 
        shall be deemed to be a separate regular session of the State 
        legislature.
