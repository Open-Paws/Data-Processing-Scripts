"Write a letter to the Editor responding to the news article, as if you are a dog. Thank the editor for highlighting this important topic. Rewrite all the main facts in the article.

A vet has warned pet owners to be very careful when using oil diffusers in their homes, as certain oils can prove fatal for dogs.
This comes after a grandmother shared how her beloved pooch was poisoned by the oils in her diffuser, and was left unable to recognise her when she returned from working a late shift as a nanny.
Sharing her warning on Facebook, Marrianne Whyte explained that she'd initially assumed she'd woken her dog up from a dream, in which he had been experiencing night terrors, but found he was ""still acting weird"" the next day.
After turning off her new diffuser, Marrianne noticed that her pet's condition started to improve, but didn't make the connection straight away. Marrianne set off for another shift, but ended up returning home early after receiving a worrying call from her dog sitter.
In her post, which has been shared more than 1.5 million times, Marrianne, who lives in New Zealand, wrote: ""[She] said that he wouldn't come out from under the bed. It was very odd as he is a happy dog.
""I came from work early and again, he was very confused about who I was. So I took him to an emergency vet. It turns out that the tea tree oil I was using in the diffuser is toxic for dogs.""

Thankfully, tests confirmed that Marriane's dog hadn't suffered liver damage, but they ""weren't out of the woods yet"", and the vet gave him fluids under his skin to get rid of any toxins.
Vet clinic Pets on Parker told 7life that cats are also at risk of being poisoned by essential oils because they don't have a liver enzyme called glucuronyl transferase, which is required to break them down.
The experts explained: ""Their livers are slower at eliminating these compounds, which can lead to toxic build-up. While dogs do not lack this enzyme, they are still sensitive to essential oils and can become very sick if exposed to them.

""Common signs of poisoning as a result of inhalation (usually from an oil diffuser) include laboured breathing, lack of coordination and difficulty walking, drooling, diarrhoea, lethargy, depression, low body temperature, weakness, muscle tremors, and vomiting.""",e9da2fa3a6d496c5a5ee500e58e5477362698aaa08e74ceeffd3fa89d0f806cb,"[{'content': 'Write a letter to the Editor responding to the news article, as if you are a dog.

Dog owners must be very careful when using oil diffusers in their homes, particularly ones containing tea tree oil. Tea tree oil can be lethal for dogs.\n\nA New Zealand grandmother shared a heartbreaking story about how her beloved pooch was poisoned by the oils in her diffuser. The poor dog was left unable to recognise her when she returned from working a late shift as a nanny. It is great that Marrianne Whyte shared her warning on Facebook because it raises awareness of this issue. In fact, her post has been shared 1.5 million times.\n\nWhen she tried to wake her dog up, she thought the dog had been having a dream, or been experiencing night terrors. However, she found that he was ""still acting weird"" the next day. The following day Marrianne set off for another shift but had to return home early after receiving a worrying call from her dog sitter because the dog wouldn\'t come out from under the bed. It was very out of character because he was a happy dog. After returning early from work Marrianne Whyte found the dog in a confused state, so she took him to the emergency vet. \n\nIt was then she discovered that the tea tree oil in her diffuser is toxic for dogs. There is a happy ending to the story, because fortunately, tests confirmed that Marriane\'s dog hadn\'t suffered liver damage. However, the vet gave him fluids under his skin to get rid of any toxins. Cat lovers should also be aware, as Vet Clinic Pets on Parker, so rightly points out. Cats are also at risk of being poisoned by essential oils. Cats don\'t have a liver enzyme called glucuronyl transferase, which is required to break them down. Cats\' livers are slower at eliminating these compounds, which can lead to toxic build-up. \n\nDogs, like me, do not lack this enzyme, but we are still sensitive to essential oils and we are liable to become very sick if exposed to them. Owners can look out for common signs of poisoning as a result of inhalation from an oil diffuser, by watching for laboured breathing, lack of coordination and difficulty walking, drooling, diarrhoea, lethargy, depression, low body temperature, weakness, muscle tremors and vomiting.\n\nTherefore, you see the terrible effects that these diffusers can have on animals like me. I thank you for highlighting and raising awareness of this problem. I hope that no other dog will have to suffer as a result of tea tree oil diffusers.\n\nRegards,\nRolo the dog', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Rewrite

Pets going missing in Stockton is nothing new.

You see the posts in community groups on Facebook and Nextdoor, with loving owners pleading for neighbors to help them find their lost furry friends. They post photos of their missing cats and dogs and their last known locations and even offer cash rewards to those who find their pets.

But a missing French bulldog is getting special attention from Stocktonians online... and local law enforcement agencies.

Dior, a 15-month-old French bulldog, was stolen from a yard in the 3000 block of Lennon Way on May 2, according to police.

""Her owner misses her dearly and would like to have her back,"" police said this week.

Frenchies can fetch thousands of dollars in ransom or the black market for buyers looking for a purebred dog. The average cost for a French bulldog puppy is $4,500.

Pet Keen — a popular pet advice website — ranked French bulldogs as the most likely to be stolen.

Dior is not the first canine to be stolen — and she won't be the last. Statistics show that pet theft and ""dognappings"" have increased in the U.S. in recent years. An estimated 2 million dogs are stolen every year, according to the American Kennel Club.

""They are having a fashion moment, and this trendy status is part of what places them so high on our list of breeds most likely to be stolen,"" said Nicole Cosgrove, lead pet expert at Pet Keen. ""They are also compact and less likely to bite than most other dogs, which is a major advantage for would-be crooks.""",ece66ca8be461107e4b4ffe59cd568dcd52057644e33cffb7482dfe621433178,"[{'content': 'Rewrite this crime report as a comic retelling.\n\nPets going missing in Stockton is nothing new.\n\nYou see the posts in community groups on Facebook and Nextdoor, with loving owners pleading for neighbors to help them find their lost furry friends.

The target audience is people who are writing fiction novels rather than shorter projects or nonfiction works."", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'Sure, I can help with that. Here are some things to do when you\'re struggling with writer\'s block:\n\n1. Take a walk. Sometimes, getting your blood flowing and your heart pumping can serve to awaken new creative impulses in the brain. Bring a smartphone or notepad on your walk so you can jot down any ideas that come to mind while you\'re on the go. You may find it helpful to listen to music as you walk or do some pointed people-watching for inspiration.\n2. Re-read your work. Sometimes, writer\'s block can be a symptom of feeling exhausted and discouraged. Writing a novel is a long and difficult undertaking, so while you\'re in the messy middle and yet to reap any of the rewards that come with a finished product, you may need to go back and re-read some of your earlier work to remind yourself how far you\'ve come, feel proud of your progress, and get a better feel for the established pacing of your story. \n3. Focus on outlines and planning. Writer\'s block isn\'t always a sign of creative burnout. Sometimes it\'s difficult to write what comes next because you don\'t really know where your story is going. You can use your time to focus on making a detailed outline that functions as a map, telling you exactly where to go next in your book. Alternatively, you could focus on drafting character or place names, fleshing out character profiles, solidifying worldbuilding elements, or any other practical logistics that need to be in place to make the world of your story feel real to readers. \n4. Read a book by another author. There are two strategies you could take here. First, you could opt to read something by an author whose work inspires you to grow as an author, perhaps an author who does an exemplary job with some of your favorite aspects of fiction writing. On the flip side, though, great authors can sometimes serve to intimidate or discourage authors who are working on rough drafts, so you might prefer instead of pick up a book that is noticeably flawed. Reading a ""bad"" book can sometimes inspire writers by giving them confidence in their own abilities and demonstrating that perfectionism is not necessarily the key to getting published. \n5. Talk to other writers. Writer\'s block happens to the best of us, and sometimes it can be helpful just to voice your concerns and frustrations out loud to someone who understands what you\'re struggling with. Other writers may also have suggestions that can help get you unstuck in your creative process. \n6. Skip ahead to an exciting scene. If you\'re feeling stuck where you are, then go ahead and skip ahead to an upcoming scene that you\'re more excited about writing. Often, doing so will help to make it easier to fill in the blanks between what you\'ve already written and the future scene you\'re excited about because when the future scene is fully fleshed out, it will be easier to determine what needs to happen in the plot to connect point A to point B. \n7. Focus on editing. Sometimes it\'s hard to know where your story is going next because the earlier plot points you\'ve written have backed you into a corner. Or, alternatively, maybe the parts of the story you\'ve already written have left you with too many options for paths leading forward, an overabundance of Chekhov\'s guns and red herrings, too many characters, or an overly complicated story arc. It may be helpful to backtrack and edit the beginning of the story so that you can see a simpler trail leading from beginning to end.', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

I'm not very good at baking and I want them to be portioned per guest."", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': ""There are plenty of individual desserts you can make for guests without baking. Here are some ideas:\n\n1. Individual Strawberry Trifles. This dessert consists of sponge cake, fruit, and custard layered in that order and displayed in a tall glass or dish. You can use a premade sponge or pound cake for an easy, bake-free dessert! This is a very versatile dessert because flavors can be mixed and matched in any way. They are perfect for entertaining because they can be scaled up or down. You can mix up the presentation by assembling this dessert in small highball glasses or mason jars, which are perfect for exact portioning. \n2. No-Bake Peanut Butter Bars. These bars can be made with most ingredients you'd already find in your pantry. Salted butter, peanut butter, powdered sugar, vanilla wafers, and semi-sweet chocolate come together to make these decadent bars that guests will be sure to love. These bars only need to be cooled in the fridge for 1 hour before they can be cut into individual bars for portioned servings. If peanut allergies are a concern, some great alternatives are seed butter or other kinds of nut butter. The flavors will be similar.\n3. Individual Key Lime Pies. Made with lime custard, graham cracker crust, and whipped cream, these will be sure to please your guests. In small individual serving dishes, flatten the graham cracker crust in the bottom, top with the key lime custard, and finish it with the whipped cream. Chill in the fridge until dessert is ready to be served.\n4. Rice Krispie Treats. This is a classic dessert that will remind guests of their childhood. Marshmallow and rice krispie cereal mix together to form this all-original favorite. Combine the ingredients with salt and vanilla extract and form the mixture in a pan while hot. Let it sit at room temperature before cutting the rice krispie treats into individual squares. Separate the squares with wax paper so they do not stick together and are easy for guests to grab.\n5. No-Bake Chocolate Oatmeal Cookies. A No-Bake interpretation of the classic chocolate chip oatmeal cookie. These cookies are made with brown sugar, cocoa powder, unsalted butter, almond butter, rolled oats, and chocolate chips. Simply combine all ingredients in a bowl and use an ice cream scooper to form them on a baking sheet, slightly flattening them into cookie shapes. Place in the freezer for 1 hour to set. Serve when ready. Other nut butter may be used in place of almond butter. "", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

"Reimagine this text as a thrilling sci-fi novel excerpt.

For the first time ever, two Saudi Arabians are living and working on the International Space Station (ISS).

Ali AlQarni and Rayyanah Barnawi launched to the orbiting lab last Sunday (May 21) on Ax-2 mission, a four-person private mission operated by the Houston company Axiom Space. The duo are just the second and third Saudis to reach space, and Barnawi is the first woman from the kingdom ever to make it to the final frontier.

AlQarni, Barnawi and their two Ax-2 crewmates — record-breaking former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, the mission's commander, and paying customer John Shoffner — will spend about eight days aboard the ISS before coming back down to Earth in their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which is named Freedom.

Ax-2 is a big deal for commercial spaceflight — it's just the second private astronaut mission to the ISS, after Axiom's Ax-1 in April 2022 — and for Saudi Arabia, which aims to build momentum from the experience and establish a bigger footprint off Earth.

"Turn the facts in this paragraph into a series of questions with answers.

A vet has warned pet owners to be very careful when using oil diffusers in their homes, as certain oils can prove fatal for dogs.
This comes after a grandmother shared how her beloved pooch was poisoned by the oils in her diffuser, and was left unable to recognise her when she returned from working a late shift as a nanny.
Sharing her warning on Facebook, Marrianne Whyte explained that she'd initially assumed she'd woken her dog up from a dream, in which he had been experiencing night terrors, but found he was ""still acting weird"" the next day.
After turning off her new diffuser, Marrianne noticed that her pet's condition started to improve, but didn't make the connection straight away. Marrianne set off for another shift, but ended up returning home early after receiving a worrying call from her dog sitter.
In her post, which has been shared more than 1.5 million times, Marrianne, who lives in New Zealand, wrote: ""[She] said that he wouldn't come out from under the bed. It was very odd as he is a happy dog.
""I came from work early and again, he was very confused about who I was. So I took him to an emergency vet. It turns out that the tea tree oil I was using in the diffuser is toxic for dogs.""

Thankfully, tests confirmed that Marriane's dog hadn't suffered liver damage, but they ""weren't out of the woods yet"", and the vet gave him fluids under his skin to get rid of any toxins.
Vet clinic Pets on Parker told 7life that cats are also at risk of being poisoned by essential oils because they don't have a liver enzyme called glucuronyl transferase, which is required to break them down.
The experts explained: ""Their livers are slower at eliminating these compounds, which can lead to toxic build-up. While dogs do not lack this enzyme, they are still sensitive to essential oils and can become very sick if exposed to them.

""Common signs of poisoning as a result of inhalation (usually from an oil diffuser) include laboured breathing, lack of coordination and difficulty walking, drooling, diarrhoea, lethargy, depression, low body temperature, weakness, muscle tremors, and vomiting.""",921befea0c479fef65e3509d903883b8cd22cd0e5a563bbc226ba7768d2299d7,"[{'content': 'Turn the facts in this paragraph into a series of questions with answers.\n\nA vet has warned pet owners to be very careful when using oil diffusers in their homes, as certain oils can prove fatal for dogs.\nThis comes after a grandmother shared how her beloved pooch was poisoned by the oils in her diffuser, and was left unable to recognise her when she returned from working a late shift as a nanny.\nSharing her warning on Facebook, Marrianne Whyte explained that she\'d initially assumed she\'d woken her dog up from a dream, in which he had been experiencing night terrors, but found he was ""still acting weird"" the next day.\nAfter turning off her new diffuser, Marrianne noticed that her pet\'s condition started to improve, but didn\'t make the connection straight away.

"Rewrite this story from the perspective of a hardcore conservative outlet.

The Texas House of Representatives has voted to impeach Attorney General Ken Paxton, an unprecedented move following a legislative probe that faulted the third-term Republican for a yearslong pattern of corruption, including abusing his office’s powers, retaliating against whistleblowers and obstructing justice.

Under state law, Paxton is now temporarily suspended from his duties as attorney general and will await a Senate trial.

The vote was 121-23, with two members voting “present.”

“The evidence is substantial. It is alarming and unnerving,” said GOP Rep. Andrew Murr, chair of the General Investigating Committee, during his closing statement following hours of debate. The committee recommended 20 counts of impeachment against Paxton.

Democrat Rep. Harold Dutton was one of the members voting present. He said the impeachment vote had been rushed. “The process by which we’re getting this done seems to be abbreviated to the point that it just encroaches on due process,” said Dutton.

Paxton denied wrongdoing in a Friday news conference, but focused his statements against the impeachment this week on his record as a key opponent of President Joe Biden. Paxton’s office has filed dozens of lawsuits against the Biden administration.

The now-suspended attorney general called the impeachment a “politically motivated sham” in a statement just minutes after the vote.

“The ugly spectacle in the Texas House today confirmed the outrageous impeachment plot against me was never meant to be fair or just,” he said.

Paxton said he was never given a chance to present evidence refuting the findings of an investigation that he abused his office. He has cast House Speaker Dade Phelan, a Republican who presides over a chamber where his party currently holds 85 seats to Democrats’ 64, as a “liberal.” He continued his attack on Phelan saying, “Phelan’s coalition of Democrats and liberal Republicans is now in lockstep with the Biden Administration, the abortion industry, anti-gun zealots, and woke corporations.”

The Office of the Attorney General issued its own “comprehensive report” about the allegations following the impeachment vote, saying it “unequivocally refutes incorrect testimony” against Paxton. The office also released a report it commissioned from an outside law firm, although the report from Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard and Smith LLP notes it is based only on information and testimony provided by the attorney general’s office.

Republican Governor Greg Abbott can appoint a provisional replacement while Paxton is temporarily suspended. Paxton would be reinstated if he is acquitted at his Senate trial.

The impeachment vote had its origins in an investigation launched in March by the General Investigating Committee of the Texas House after Paxton had asked the legislature to approve $3.3 million in government funds to settle a lawsuit with four whistleblowers who were fired from his office.

That investigation led the committee – a five-member panel investigating corruption in state government – to approve 20 articles of impeachment Thursday, setting up the vote in the full House.

During the debate Saturday, Rep. Charlie Geren, who is a Republican, claimed Paxton had threatened fellow House members.

“I would like to point out that several members of this House, while on the floor of this House doing the state’s business, received telephone calls from General Paxton personally threatening them with political consequences in their next election,” Geren said.

Opponents of the impeachment largely declined to address the allegations against him, instead focusing on the investigation leading up to the proceedings. “I don’t think today is about whether there’s guilt or innocence. It’s about the process,” said Rep. Tony Tinderholt.

“I’m not here to defend Ken Paxton,” Rep. John T. Smithee stated on the floor. He went on to say, “What you’re being asked to do today is to impeach without evidence. It is all rumor. It is all innuendo. It is all speculation.”

Paxton’s impeachment is a stunning rebuke of a Republican official in a state where the GOP controls all levers of state government. Voters in Texas shrugged off the swirling scandals around Paxton last year, handing him a third term in November’s election. Paxton had earlier fought off multiple opponents for the GOP nomination, including Bush family scion George P. Bush, the state land commissioner, whom he easily bested in a runoff.

Paxton has long been a controversial figure who has clashed with Texas legislative leadership. A conservative who has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump, he led a lawsuit in 2020 seeking to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election.

He retains support within the Texas GOP. In a statement Friday, state party chairman Matt Rinaldi blasted Phelan for what he called a “sham impeachment.”

“The voters have supported General Paxton through three elections – and his popularity has only grown despite millions of dollars spent to try to defeat him. Now the Texas House is trying to overturn the election results,” Rinaldi said, adding that he was looking to the “principled leadership” of the Senate to “restore sanity and reason for our state.”

In Texas, no attorney general has ever been impeached and removed from office. The only two elected officials to lose office as a result of impeachment were Gov. James Ferguson in 1917 and District Judge O.P. Carrillo in 1975.

For Paxton to be removed from office, two-thirds of the Texas Senate’s members who are present will have to vote to convict him. His wife, Angela Paxton, is a state senator representing a Dallas-area district.

It’s not yet clear when the Senate, where Republicans have a 19-12 majority over Democrats, will conduct its trial. The state’s legislative session is scheduled to end Monday.",03cb732f205031fab7d7a0146b2c5cdfff7182067d74b0326a467a60b31a3021,"[{'content': 'Rewrite this story from the perspective of a hardcore conservative outlet.\n\nThe Texas House of Representatives has voted to impeach Attorney General Ken Paxton, an unprecedented move following a legislative probe that faulted the third-term Republican for a yearslong pattern of corruption, including abusing his office’s powers, retaliating against whistleblowers and obstructing justice.\n\nUnder state law, Paxton is now temporarily suspended from his duties as attorney general and will await a Senate trial.\n\nThe vote was 121-23, with two members voting “present.”\n\n“The evidence is substantial.

The office also released a report it commissioned from an outside law firm, although the report from Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard and Smith LLP notes it is based only on information and testimony provided by the attorney general’s office.\n\nThe impeachment vote had its origins in an investigation launched in March by the General Investigating Committee of the Texas House after Paxton had asked the legislature to approve $3.3 million in government funds to settle a lawsuit with four whistleblowers who were fired from his office.\n\nOpponents of the impeachment largely declined to address the allegations against him, instead focusing on the investigation leading up to the proceedings. “I don’t think today is about whether there’s guilt or innocence. It’s about the process,” said Rep. Tony Tinderholt.\n\n“I’m not here to defend Ken Paxton,” Rep. John T. Smithee stated on the floor. He went on to say, “What you’re being asked to do today is to impeach without evidence. It is all rumor. It is all innuendo. It is all speculation.”\n\nMany cannot help but wonder if the time and effort was worth it here, given his massive popularity. Paxton had earlier fought off multiple opponents for the GOP nomination, including Bush family scion George P. Bush, the state land commissioner, whom he easily bested in a runoff.\n\nSome might wonder if this was borne of jealousy from less popular members of the Texas legislative branch. Paxton has long been close with former President Donald Trump, and led a lawsuit in 2020 seeking to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election. \n\nJust like with the voters, Paxton retains plenty of support within the highest ranks of true Texas GOP leaders. In a statement Friday, state party chairman Matt Rinaldi blasted Phelan for what he called a “sham impeachment.”\n\n“The voters have supported General Paxton through three elections – and his popularity has only grown despite millions of dollars spent to try to defeat him. Now the Texas House is trying to overturn the election results,” Rinaldi said, adding that he was looking to the “principled leadership” of the Senate to “restore sanity and reason for our state.”\n\nIt’s not yet clear when the Senate, where Republicans have a 19-12 majority over Democrats, will conduct its trial. This may all be merely an attempt for low level Texas RINOs to gain attention for themselves.', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Rewrite

With consideration to your band\'s genre and theme of music, here are some band names that use each of those special characters: !@#$%^&*\n\n1) Dr!nkn\'\nThis name is a play on words for one of the popular themes in country music: drinking. The exclamation point also represents the surprise and excitement of drinking with your friends. In terms of art, the exclamation point may also symbolize someone on their head, upside down, symbolizing the wacky adventures that may proceed during a night of drinking.\n\n2) @L@B@M@\nThis name substitutes all the letter A\'s in the word ""Alabama"", with the special character, ""@"". Having multiple instances of this special character may create a neat illusion of the band\'s name swirling and spinning.\n\n3) NeedleInA#\nThis name mimics the common saying of, ""looking for a needle in a haystack"". The word ""needle"" is a double entendre and may refer to an actual needle of a record player or a physical needle, while the word ""haystack"" was replaced with the special character ""#"", loosely resembling a compressed haystack. Haystacks are also commonly found on farms and in barns.\n\n4) $outh$wamp\nWith many southern states in America having swamps as part of their geographic terrain, this band name references that landscape while replacing the letter S\'s in ""SouthSwamp"", with the special character, ""$"". The special character also may resemble a slithering snake, an animal commonly found in swamplands.\n\n5) 100%Hennessey\nSimilar to the band name Dr!nkn\', this name references Hennessey, an alcoholic brandy popular in the South. The ""100%"" portrays a complete and focused dedication to having fun, going all out, and drinking with friends, which are themes in some popular country music songs.\n\n6) Sun^Overalls^\nThis band name interprets the phrase ""Sun\'s up, overall\'s up"", meaning that at sunrise, a farmer would pull up and wear their overalls to begin their day on the farm. The word ""up"" was replaced with the special character, ""^"", symbolizing an up direction pointing north, thus creating the band name, Sun^Overall^.\n\n7) Moon&Shine\nSimilar to Dr!nkn\' and 100%Hennessey, this band name references moonshine, a high-proof whiskey, traditionally made illegally, especially in the South where it continues to remain popular. This band name bifurcates the word ""moonshine"" into two independent words, moon, and shine, reattached with the special character, ""&"", and pronounced simply: moonshine.\n\n8) Southern*\nThis band name takes the name ""Southern Star"" and replaces the word ""Star"" with the special character, ""*"", resembling a star in the night sky. Although Southern Star is not intentionally referencing anything in particular, the stresses on the consonants make the pronunciation of this band name easy and fun to say, with intentional stress placed on the ""S"" letters in this band name.', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

This gave me a sense of privacy and respect for my experience. The dining room was open with windows on three of the four walls giving abundant natural light and allowing me to gaze over the manicured vista outside. \n\nUpon revealing my food, I knew I would be in for a treat. My first course consisted of French-fried potatoes, hot out of the fryer and with just the right amount of salt. A tasting of different dipping sauces was provided, including ketchup, honey mustard, and barbecue. Each tasting gave a new flavor profile to the crisp fries and their fluffy interior. \n\nMoving on to the main course, I was served a cheeseburger with two patties, American cheese, crispy bacon, lettuce, tomato, and the restaurant's proprietary secret sauce. The presentation of the sandwich was beautiful with the glistening of the meat and fixings nustled softly in the bosom of the fluffy sesame-seed-covered buns. My first bite sent me to heaven.

"Could you please rephrase the given description into a fairy-tale style narrative about the life and journey of meteoroids in the solar system?

Meteoroids are lumps of rock or iron that orbit the sun, just as planets, asteroids, and comets do. Meteoroids, especially the tiny particles called micrometeoroids, are extremely common throughout the solar system. They orbit the sun among the rocky inner planets, as well as the gas giants that make up the outer planets. Meteoroids are even found on the edge of the solar system, in regions called the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud.

Different meteoroids travel around the sun at different speeds and in different orbits. The fastest meteoroids travel through the solar system at a speed of around 42 kilometers (26 miles) per second.

Many meteoroids are formed from the collision of asteroids, which orbit the sun between the paths of Mars and Jupiter in a region called the asteroid belt. As asteroids smash into each other, they produce crumbly debris—meteoroids. The force of the asteroid collision can throw the meteoroid debris—and sometimes the asteroids themselves—out of their regular orbit. This can put the meteoroids on a collision course with a planet or moon.

Other meteoroids are the debris that comets shed as they travel through space. As a comet approaches the sun, the “dirty snowball” of the comet’s nucleus sheds gas and dust. The dusty tail may contain hundreds or even thousands of meteoroids and micrometeoroids. Meteoroids shed by a comet usually orbit together in a formation called a meteoroid stream.

A very small percentage of meteoroids are rocky pieces that break off from the Moon and Mars after celestial bodies—often asteroids or other meteoroids—impact their surfaces. Meteoroid impacts are probably the largest contributor to “space weathering.” Space weathering describes the processes that act upon a celestial body that doesn’t have an airy atmosphere, such as asteroids, many moons, or the planets Mars and Mercury. Meteoroids crash into these bodies, creating craters and throwing space dust (more meteoroids) back into the solar system.

"Turn the facts in this paragraph into a series of questions with answers

Over 5,000 previously unknown sea creatures, including sea sponges, worms and urchins, were discovered in a pristine, almost untouched area of the Pacific Ocean that might soon become the site of mineral mining operations.

Large-scale environmental surveys were previously conducted there from the late 1970s to early 1990s, but only compiled lists with informal species names and very few formal species descriptions.

Scientists now compiled these informal lists and published their results in a peer-reviewed study on May 25 in the journal Current Biology. According to their estimates, they found a total of 5,578 different species in the region, an estimated 88%–92% of which were described for the first time ever.

The region where all of the new species were discovered is called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), a 6 million sq. km. area roughly twice the size of India, lying between Hawaii, Kiribati, and Mexico in the central and eastern Pacific. 

“We share this planet with all this amazing biodiversity, and we have a responsibility to understand it and protect it,” Muriel Rabone, a deep-sea ecologist at the Natural History Museum London, told the website Eurekalert.

In the course of decades of exploration missions in the CCZ, over 100,000 creatures were recorded. The researchers found that only six of these had ever been seen in other regions, after combing through all the files. The most common species they found in the remote region were arthropods (invertebrates with segmented joints), worms, echinoderms (spiny invertebrates like sea urchins), and sponges.

“There are some just remarkable species down there. Some of the sponges look like classic bath sponges, and some look like vases. They’re just beautiful,” said Rabone of the CCZ samples. “One of my favorites is the glass sponges. They have these little spines, and under the microscope, they look like tiny chandeliers or little sculptures. There are so many wonderful species in the CCZ, and with the possibility of mining looming, it’s doubly important that we know more about these really understudied habitats.”

The rise in global demand for metals like cobalt and nickel has created unprecedented interest in deep-sea habitats which possess mineral resources. Exploration of the CCZ for minerals began in 1960, and today 1.2 million sq. km. are divided up and assigned to 17 companies for future deep-sea mining.

The scientists expect the overall number of species in the region to continue to climb, as vast areas of the CCZ still haven't been explored.

Can you help me come up with some creative ways to eat more veggies? Make sure your ideas have some degree of explanation. "", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': ""Absolutely, I'm happy to help with that. Here are five creative ways to add more vegetables to your diet: \n\n1. Include them in a smoothie. There are many delicious and healthy smoothies that incorporate vegetables as part of a balanced breakfast or snack. One popular example is a kale, pineapple, and banana smoothie with a bit of dairy or non-dairy milk. Some other ideas are to substitute kale for spinach or to try something completely different like a beet or carrot smoothie. \n\n2. Roast them in the oven. Roasting vegetables with a bit of salt, pepper, and oil can be a great way to add flavor and texture without much effort. Some great roasting vegetables include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower.   \n\n3. Make appealing salads to go. A new social media-inspired health trend is to prepare attractive-looking salads in convenient and ready-to-go containers such as mason jars. The salads are put in the container in layers with dressing at the bottom, followed by vegetables that are not vulnerable to water such as chopped broccoli, cauliflower, cucumbers, tomatoes, and carrots. After that, you can add leafy vegetables such as lettuce, cabbage, spinach, and kale. You can also add a lean protein like chicken, some nuts, or even a bit of fruit depending on what you're in the mood to eat. \n\n4. Spiralize them and use them instead of noodles. Spiralized zucchini, summer squash, or even beets can be a great change of pace for a plate of pasta with tomato sauce. Use them exactly as you would regular pasta for a delicious and healthy low-carb meal.   \n\n5. Add them to desserts. If you're looking for something indulgent, consider carrot cakes, pumpkin pies, and sweet potato puddings as some sweet treats that incorporate vegetables. If you would prefer something a bit healthier overall, you might be interested in trying roasted beets in chocolate pudding cakes, kale in carrot muffins, or zucchini in coconut chocolate cookies, to name a few possibilities. \n\nI hope that these ideas inspire you to find new and creative ways to add vegetables to your diet. Remember to experiment and develop unique recipes that work for your goals!"", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

We will get to all of these things as well as discuss my own personal experience with different creatine supplementation methods. \n\nNarrator: My husband and I decided to try creatine supplementation for the first time. He did a loading phase before switching to a daily maintenance dose and I did not, I just started with a daily maintenance dose. If you just want to hear about this personal experience, go ahead and skip to about [time stamp] in this video. \n\nNarrator: A loading phase of creatine is when you take a large amount of creatine in a short amount of time to saturate your muscles quickly with creatine. \n\nNarrator: Most people's baseline muscular creatine stores are only at around 60-80%, so this means that we can increase the creatine in our muscles by roughly 20-40% through supplementation. \n\nNarrator: The standard dosing recommendation for a creatine loading phase is 20-25 grams for 5-7 days. Now, this is a GENERAL recommendation, and your exact amount in grams could fall outside of this range depending on your weight. A more precise calculation is your body weight in kilograms multiplied by 0.3. \n\nNarrator: After the initial loading phase, muscles can remain saturated with just a daily 3-5 gram maintenance dose. \n\nNarrator: Research indicates that if you don't want to do a loading phase, you don't have to in order to reap the benefits of creatine. It will just take approximately 28 days as opposed to 5-7 days to fully saturate your muscles with creatine. \n\nNarrator: In my husband's case, he wanted to see benefits from creatine sooner rather than later, so he took 20 grams of creatine for 5 days straight, then followed this loading phase with a daily maintenance dose of 5 grams. In my case, I wasn't in a rush, so I just took 5 grams daily for 28 days. \n"", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Generation

"Rewrite this Reddit post about the movie ""Moonstruck"" as a dramatic poem. 

I saw Moonstruck (1987) and god it was one of the most comforting movies ever.

I’m a big recent fan of the criterion collection and I get stuff that piques my interest. I’m taking a music course right now and they discuss how a particular song “Clair De Lune” was in this movie. So I finally bought it after a couple months of deliberating. Finding out Nicolas Cage was in this film was the final nail for me to buy this film.

Instantly I knew that I was not gonna regret this purchase. The whole closeness of the Italian family, Cher’s stunning performance and looks, and Nicolas Cage acting bat shit before he was known for bat shit crazy roles. It’s a very intimate and cozy film, especially on a cold October night under some blankets with a date.

Yes, some of the characters themselves are doing immoral things, but you can’t help but love them and just how hilariously dramatic they are. It’s pretty romantic and offers some deep thoughts about love and relationships.

For date night, a cozy film during cold season, or even a unique romantic comedy that isn’t too syrupy or goofy like usual rom/coma, Moonstruck is a win.

With these platforms, you can set your own schedule.\n-Sign up with a delivery service - Many delivery services like Instacart will allow delivery drivers to set their own schedules. \n-Take surveys online - There are many different platforms that pay users low rates to take surveys online, such as MTurk, Prolific, Springboard Panel, and Ipsos. The pay rate is usually relatively low, but you'll have a lot of freedom to set your own schedule and decide which surveys are (or aren't) worth your time.\n-Sign up for pet-sitting services - Platforms like Rover.com allow you to market yourself as a dog walker or pet sitter. You can visit other people's homes to check on their pets or host their pets at your home for a single day or multiple overnight stays. You'll have the power to decline any offer that doesn't suit your schedule. \n-Sign up for focus groups - With focus groups, you can get paid just to share your opinion on products or entertainment. These groups often require you to be present in person or virtually for specific hours, but you can always decline if the scheduled time doesn't work for you. The same is true of signing up for mock juries. \n-Become a mystery shopper - There are several different services that will pay you to visit stores and businesses as an undercover quality control analyst. Typically, they'll provide you with a checklist of things to review in the store and very clear instructions. All you have to do is visit the spot in question on your own time, follow the directions, and get paid. If the directions require you to make a purchase, the company will reimburse you. \n-Sell arts and crafts - If you've got a hobby (or more than one) that produces marketable products, consider selling them on platforms like Etsy, eBay, or Shopify. If your schedule is unpredictable, consider setting a shop policy that informs buyers that you're only available to ship items and respond to customer inquiries on certain days/times each week. You can also sell these items on your own website or at craft vendor fairs. \n-Re-sell used items - There are plenty of websites and brick-and-mortar stores where you can sell your used clothes, electronics, furniture, appliances, and more. \n-Sign up for a copywriting platform - You may want to do some research on these platforms to determine which is the best fit, as some do require their writers to meet a monthly minimum of work hours. Some don't, though, and will simply list available short-term copywriting projects for you to take or leave as you see fit.\n-Start your own small business - You can work with clients as a writing coach, editor, or in any other capacity you feel qualified to. It will be up to you to determine when you meet with clients and for how long. You can also set your own pay rate.\n"", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

When the music plays, the skaters travel around the rink like normal. When the music stops, they find a corner. A designated dice roller will roll the large fuzzy die, and whichever corner number is rolled is removed from the game. This process of elimination continues until only one player is left and they are declared the winner. There are variations that can be used, such as playing odd/even corners or keeping the number that is rolled rather than eliminating that corner, which speeds up the game significantly.\n\n* Rockin\' Robin (or the Record Game): This game is for skaters of intermediate skill. The DJ will play the songs ""Rockin\' Robin"" or ""You Spin Me Round"" and blow the whistle throughout the song. When the whistle blows, skaters must turn and skate in the opposite direction. The whistle strikes may be fast and challenging, resulting in skaters making a complete circle. Skaters must pay close attention to the whistles.\n\n* Shoot the Duck: This game is played in teams, either red vs. blue or girls vs. boys. When the DJ blows the whistle, students must assume a squatting position on their skates and cannot use their legs to gain speed. As skaters lose momentum, they will stop moving and sit on their bottom. The goal is to be the last skater moving in order to earn a point for their team. The first team to five points wins the opportunity to skate one song all by themselves.\n\n* Dodgeball: For advanced skaters, adults/teachers/employees can throw the balls while students skate around the rink and ""dodge"" the balls. If a skater is ""hit,"" they must sit in the middle of the floor. The goal is to be the last skater standing. If a skater catches the ball, the adult must sit down, instead. Adults should begin by throwing the balls high, so they can be easily ducked under, but aim progressively lower as the song continues. \n\nThese games are competitive or involve silly movements that are sure to keep skaters engaged. Longer games such as dodgeball can be played during large skating blocks, while it\'s easier to fit Rockin\' Robin and short rounds of The Four Corner Game in between other activities.

How was that achieved? In short, it was the use of busks that produced the silhouette and structure of the upper part of gowns. A busk could be made out of wood, bone, or sometimes metal. During the Tudor period, these flat inserts became more and more ornamental. They could be etched with personal messages or swirls of branching flora. These busks were the first step toward the corset we would later become so familiar with, providing rigidity and forcing good posture that advertised to the world that a woman was high-born. \n\nOne very important piece of underwear was the ""bum roll."" Showing up for the first time in the 1500s, this stuffed tube of fabric was tied around the lower portion of a lady\'s waist to increase her hip circumference and the amount of fabric she could wear on her skirts. Since silks and brocades were the going materials of the day and deeply exclusive because of cost, the more fabric worn translated into more wealth a wearer was likely to have. These bum rolls allowed for wide swathes of skirts, more pleats, and flounces. These undergarments also helped the women to bear some of the weight of their heavy skirts without it sitting directly on their hip bones. Tudor fashion was more about statement than comfort. Like busks, bum rolls were essentially shapewear, modifying the female silhouette to what was considered ideal at the time. \n\nOne of the most important pieces of jewelry a woman of this period may have owned would have been her girdle belt. This was a long string, often of silver or gold and embellished with gems, that highlighted a woman\'s small waist and hung downward. Some women wore a pomander ball at the end of their girdle belts for when the city air got especially ripe. Others, like Anne Boleyn, used it to carry small prayer books about with them. Katherine of Aragon was even known to clutch the girdle belt of her patron saint while in childbirth, though this doesn\'t seem to have provided her with any luck. There are portraits of Kaherine herself in an immense string of pearls girdle belt that matches her royal necklaces. One of Jane Seymour, Henry\'s third wife, shows a girdle belt with a pattern of pearls and red gems that leads to a very large oval stone set in gold at the end. ', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Generation

Can you give me a list and explain how to do them?",a9977510ff8921e33c027f4f242acd15ca313b6b5f4f2bda3d77c158a5b307a9,"[{'content': ""I want to get in shape but I need ideas for exercises that I can do for my legs, but I don't have any weights to use.  Can you give me a list and explain how to do them?"", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': ""Here are some exercises you can do to train your legs without needing weights. \n\n1. Squats\nSquats have long been regarded as the best way to build strong legs and butt. The squat mainly works your quads, glutes, and core but will also work your hamstrings to a lesser extent.\n\nTo do a squat stand with your feet hip or shoulder width apart in a stable stance. From there, push your hips back as if you were going to sit down. While the hips are moving back, let your knees bend and move down until you feel the strain. Be sure to try and maintain vertical shins throughout the exercise. Once you are at your lowest point, you can begin to push yourself back up to a standing position. You can make this harder by adding a heavy backpack or holding something in each hand so long as the objects are equal in weight.\n\n2. Jump Squat\nSimilar to the standard squat, you can use a jump squat to improve your power and increase the intensity of the exercise. A jump squat will be more beneficial when building your fast-twitch muscle fibers. \n\nPerforming a jump squat is as easy as it sounds. Start off in a squat position and perform a standard squat. Once you are at your low point, use the power in your legs to jump up and make sure to land softly in the same position you started. Try to maintain form with this exercise. Keeping your legs controlled when jumping will also help to increase core strength. \n\n3. Lunge\nA lunge requires immense stability as you split your hips in half. A great exercise for your glutes, quads, and hamstrings, a lunge can be done pretty much anywhere. A lunge will also help you work your hip stabilizers as you try to maintain balance. \n\nA lunge is done by standing in a normal position with your feet. From here, extend one leg backward until both of your knees are at a 90-degree angle. Your front knee should not go past your toes. From here, push off with your back leg to regain your original stance. Repeat this for both legs as many times as you wish.\n\n4. Jump Lunge\nJust as a jump squat increases your fast-twitch muscle fibers, so will a jump lunge. A great exercise for building power in your legs. This exercise is not easy, so be careful when trying it, and ensure you are comfortable with a standard lunge first. \n\nTo do a Jump lunge, get into a lunge position as you would normally. From the point where your knees are bent, you can now jump up and alternate your legs in the air. This should be performed in a controlled way so that you land softly. \n\n5. Side Lunge\nA side lunge is similar to a normal lunge but has key differences. Firstly this exercise will work your abductors, glutes, and quads. Working different leg muscles on a lateral plane rather than a linear one is a good exercise. This is important as the range of motion we experience with our legs daily is large. \n\nStart off in a standing position. Next, move one leg out to the side. Imagine it's just one leg in a normal squat position. Your knee should be bent but not past your toes. Your other leg should be straight. From here, simply return to standing and alternate the legs as you go. \n\n6. Sumo Squat\nWe've done normal squats, so now here is the sumo squat. The sumo squat pays particular attention to your adductors, glutes, and quads. \n\nStart off by standing as a sumo with your legs wider than your shoulders to where it is comfortable. Keep your toes slightly pointed away from your body. From this position, perform a squat as you would usually, and again, be sure that your knee doesn't extend past your foot and that your shin stays as vertical as it can. \n\n\n\n\n"", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

The initial word of the battle came from an Eagle messenger.  The invasion\'s success surprised residents of Minas Tirith, as the 6,000 to 7,000-man expeditionary force attacking the Black Gates was expected to be outnumbered by a factor of at least ten-to-one by orcs and Mordor\'s human allies.  Many military experts considered the attack to be futile.\n\nAccounts of the battle remain incomplete, but casualties are heavy, with over a thousand injured and several hundred dead.  Orcs were close to overrunning Western positions before the tide of battle turned.  How the forces of Mordor were defeated remains unclear. Still, initial reports indicate that the assault on the Black Gate was made in conjunction with the actions of a small team of Halfling saboteurs who were able to infiltrate Mordor and destroy its headquarters at the tower of Barad Dur, possibly with the assistance of some ancient magical artifact.\n\nHowever it was accomplished, numerous eyewitnesses report seeing the tower fall and Mt. Doom erupting.  Sauron appears to have perished as the tower collapsed, and his forces broke down in disarray almost immediately.  Some observers report that the Ringwraiths turned from the battle and headed back toward Barad Dur just as it broke down,  Trolls and other monsters scattered almost immediately, and Mordor\'s human allies agreed to a truce shortly afterward.\n\nThe Gondorian military refused to comment on the ""Hobbit Commandos,"" however, one source close to royal claimant Aragorn remarked that ""those little people may not look all that tough, but they do have a knack for covert ops.""\n\nThe victory at the Black Gate ends two weeks of turmoil for Minas Tirith and the Kingdom of Gondor which culminated in a massive battle near the city gates and the suicide of Denethor, Steward of Gondor.  Aragorn, the former northern Ranger who has claimed kingship over Gondor appears to have survived the battle and is expected to be coronated in the next month.', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Generation

To my delight, I spied a house with an open door. I could hear the sound of the television blaring out from the lounge and as I peered through the window, I saw a couple relaxing in front of Britain's Got Talent. They seemed very preoccupied, so I decided to take a closer look and go inside.\n\nI padded into the house, through the open door and made my way upstairs. There, I saw two babies sleeping soundly in a cot. They looked about nine months old. I was curious about these human children and decided to take a closer inspection. However, I accidentally clawed one of the babies on its arms and face, and the baby started to bleed heavily. There was blood everywhere, but I certainly didn't mean to harm the human child. I think the baby was startled by my presence and she began to make a hideous wailing noise. Before I could make my escape, I heard footsteps coming up the stairs and felt an adult human presence entering the room. Then, a glaring light lit up everything and I was so shocked, I just froze. I stared in horror at the lady who was in front of me. I looked her right in the eye and she glared back at me. \n\nThen, I fled back down the stairs, leaping and bounding two at a time, until I was in the garden, and I sheltered behind a thick hedge. From my vantage point, I heard a terrible commotion coming from the upstairs bedroom. A female voice shrieked and yelled. I heard the sound of a loud siren and an ambulance appeared. Two men jumped out hurriedly and raced inside, in an emergency. After a few minutes, the men reappeared, grasping a baby, followed by a sobbing woman and they all drove off in the ambulance. There had been such an uproar that many people had come out of their houses to see what was happening. A man was shouting that a vicious fox had attacked and seriously injured his baby. I thought that was an extremely unfair accusation, and untrue. I am not a vicious fox. I would never attack an innocent child. What happened was an accident. Sometimes, I forget how sharp my claws are.\n\nHowever, I noticed from that time on, that all doors and windows in the neighbourhood were firmly closed. There was no opportunity to enter these homes. Moreover, humans began to behave uncharacteristically and cruelly. Sadly, a tragedy happened and one of my friends was murdered. He was caught in a trap left out by one of these humans.

"Transform the information from this text into a conversation between a space enthusiast and a skeptical friend.

A Chinese launch company has stepped up its quest to develop reusable rockets with sea platform landing tests using a small demonstrator.

The tests — which launch and land a jet engine-powered rocket prototype to test guidance, navigation and control systems, software and communications — are being conducted by CAS Space, a spinoff from the state-owned Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

A video released by the firm shows a 6.9-foot-tall (2.1 meters), 205-pound (93 kilograms) prototype lifting off from a vessel at sea off the coast of Haiyang in eastern China's Shandong Province.

The prototype reached an altitude of around 3,280 feet (1,000 m) before touching back down on the sea platform. The test flight depicted in the video took around 10 minutes, according to CAS Space.

The company has been carrying out such tests during the first few months of 2023, according to a press statement on April 4. 

Landing the first stage of a rocket on a sea platform instead of back on terra firma closer to the launch site is expected to save a significant amount of fuel, and hence reduce the amount of payload-carrying capacity lost by a rocket in reusable configuration. 

SpaceX already employs this strategy, commonly bringing the first stages of its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets down on ""drone ships"" stationed at sea several hundred miles from their launch sites.

CAS Space aims to launch its own reusable orbital rockets in the future, as well as a suborbital rocket for space tourism, in a similar fashion to U.S. firm Blue Origin and its New Shepard.

A CAS Space engineer told Chinese state media outlet Global Times that the firm might hold a first test flight of a near-space scientific experiment platform as early as the end of 2023.",7497da8fe879f780a11b528a00bf0a5e755945e8141f0bfa7b7c935db7ee048e,"[{'content': 'Transform the information from this text into a conversation between a space enthusiast and a skeptical friend.\n\nA Chinese launch company has stepped up its quest to develop reusable rockets with sea platform landing tests using a small demonstrator.\n\nThe tests — which launch and land a jet engine-powered rocket prototype to test guidance, navigation and control systems, software and communications — are being conducted by CAS Space, a spinoff from the state-owned Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).\n\nA video released by the firm shows a 6.9-foot-tall (2.1 meters), 205-pound (93 kilograms) prototype lifting off from a vessel at sea off the coast of Haiyang in eastern China\'s Shandong Province.\n\nThe prototype reached an altitude of around 3,280 feet (1,000 m) before touching back down on the sea platform.

You can use handheld Churo treats if you want your cat to come close to you, as many cats love licking those treats.\n2. Toy Mice: Although some toys involve cats running around a lot, toy mice tend to be better as your cat can play with them in one spot if they choose to. Sit on the floor with your cat and toss them some toy mice, encouraging them to play. You can also get toy mice that have squeakers or catnip, both of which will further encourage your cat to get involved.\n3. Petting: Petting is a great, underrated way to bond with your cat. Make sure you take note of where your cat likes to be petted. Most cats don't like being touched on their belly, but some love head scratches! You can test this out by gently petting them in different places and looking for signs that they do or don't enjoy what's going on. If they don't enjoy it, try switching to petting them in a different place.\n4. Catnip: Providing catnip is a good way to bring your cat close to you. Try putting some in objects that are near you, as they'll attract your cat to come closer.\n5. Give Them Space: Believe it or not, giving your cat space can be a great way to bond with a skittish cat. Some cats would prefer to come to you rather than you coming to them, especially if they're new to your household. Chill near them, but don't force them to interact, and you might notice it's not long before your cat is sliding closer and warming up to you.\n\nRemember that all cats are different, so it's important to observe your cat's personality and learn their likes and dislikes. By doing this, you'll quickly find the best way to bond with them."", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

Plastic is all around us: in our toothbrushes, pens, cars, and even clothing! It is very useful. But plastic trash ends up in the environment and is bad for animals and humans.

- Turtle Species: current poached use



Among the populations he is fighting to preserve are the Golden coin turtle, a species once prized for medicinal purposes and used in turtle jelly but now in demand as an exotic pet whose rarity and strange looks have made it only more valuable to poachers. Buyers see the golden stripes on their heads as a symbol of prosperity and are willing in extreme cases to pay hundreds of thousands of US dollars.

Sung says there are thought to be around 100 left in Hong Kong -- one of the world's last significant populations, he says.

Facing a similar plight is the Beale's eyed turtle, fewer than 200 of which are thought to be left in Hong Kong and an unknown -- but thought to be very small -- number in mainland China. These turtles have a pattern on the back of their head in the shape of two eyes -- possibly an evolutionary trait, some scientists suggest, meant to scare off predators. Its unique looks have made it too a prize for exotic pet keepers, who pay hundreds to 

Then there is the Big-headed turtle, another strange-looking species that has become popular with those seeking an exotic pet. It has an eagle-like beak, a crocodile-like tail and a head so big it can't fit in its shell. A few hundred are left in Hong Kong, and perhaps even fewer in its other homes of Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. It can go for up to $1,000 on the illegal market.

A booming industry
None of the three turtles mentioned so far are suitable to be kept as pets. The Big-headed turtle is particularly unsuitable, Sung says, as for them to survive they would require elaborate enclosures to mimic their natural environments.

What's more, under Hong Kong law, possession of an endangered turtle is a criminal offense punishable by up to a maximum of 10 years in jail and a HK$10 million [$1.27 million] fine, depending on the species.

Yet they remain in popular demand and represent just the tip of the iceberg of the illegal trade in turtles in the city -- which involves both endangered species and more common ones.

"Summarize the roles mentioned below for league of legends in one sentence for each role given:

MID
The mid laner is the most popular and played role among the millions of LoL players worldwide. It is one of the lines with the most action and relevance in the game and allows incredible rotations throughout the map to ensure the team's advantage.

This new meta, which benefits mages and control mage in general, is bringing with it a lane champion like Viktor, Corki (with a hybrid build), Ahri, among others. Although this is not to say that assassin champions in the mid lane are not being played anymore.

The Mid Lane has established itself as the favorite line of hundreds of players due to its versatility and importance within the game, not surprisingly, many of the most famous players in the World Championship Tournaments are also players in the mid lane.

TOP
The top line is a long, lateral and individual lane; being therefore the most isolated line of the game. It is a perfect line for those players who love to compare their skills against another player in a constant fight for control of the lane. Normally, tanks or fighters are usually played in the top lane like Sett, Dr Mundo, Yorick, among others.

This line, in League of Legends, is the closest thing to a 1v1. This is due to its very nature, since being the farthest line on the map, you will have less support (the jungler usually plays around the Dragon of the BOT lane), so the most popular summoner is Teleport. Although the Teleport has recently received a nerf, the use of this summoner spell is left to the player's choice and in consideration of the match up.",552e54269a7136a4b3d7b892e0b434b626c34eac5ff6d35f88c468470e1a925a,"[{'content': ""Summarize the roles mentioned below for league of legends in one sentence for each role given:\n\nMID\nThe mid laner is the most popular and played role among the millions of LoL players worldwide.

"Please rewrite this article from the perspective of the spy whale, as if it was reporting to its Russian handler. 

People should “avoid contact” with a famous beluga whale to avoid accidentally injuring or killing it, the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries has said.

The whale, nicknamed Hvaldimir, shot to international fame in 2019 after it was spotted wearing a specially made harness with mounts for a camera, leading experts to believe the whale may have been trained by the Russian military.

Since 2019, it has “been traveling along the Norwegian coast” with a few stops along the way, according to the directorate, which added that Hvaldimir “tends to stay at farms where it has been able to catch fish, grazing on surplus feed.”

Hvaldimir is known to follow boats and play with those on board.

The whale, which is a protected species in Norway, now lives in inner Oslofjord, the directorate said.

This “means that it has arrived in a very densely populated area, and the risk that the whale may be injured due to human contact has become significantly greater,” it added.

In a statement on Wednesday, Fisheries Director Frank Bakke-Jensen said that “so far there have only been minor incidents where the whale has suffered minor injuries, primarily from contact with boats.”

But he urged people to keep their distance, “even though the whale is tame and used to being around people.”

“We especially encourage people in boats to keep a good distance to avoid the whale being injured or, in the worst case, killed by boat traffic,” said Bakke-Jensen.

Given the dangers, Bakke-Jensen was asked whether the whale should be placed in captivity.

“We have always communicated that the whale in question is a free-living animal and we see no reason to capture it and put it behind barriers,” he said.

However, now that the whale is “in a more vulnerable area and access to food may be limited, we will consider different measures,” added Bakke-Jensen. “But it is too early to say anything concrete about that yet.”",33c6fcc461c9eae6ce9d94e24bc55b93c99dcf11f79d182ee5bc59b21221a75a,"[{'content': 'Please rewrite this article from the perspective of the spy whale, as if it was reporting to its Russian handler. \n\nPeople should “avoid contact” with a famous beluga whale to avoid accidentally injuring or killing it, the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries has said.\n\nThe whale, nicknamed Hvaldimir, shot to international fame in 2019 after it was spotted wearing a specially made harness with mounts for a camera, leading experts to believe the whale may have been trained by the Russian military.\n\nSince 2019, it has “been traveling along the Norwegian coast” with a few stops along the way, according to the directorate, which added that Hvaldimir “tends to stay at farms where it has been able to catch fish, grazing on surplus feed.”\n\nHvaldimir is known to follow boats and play with those on board.\n\nThe whale, which is a protected species in Norway, now lives in inner Oslofjord, the directorate said.\n\nThis “means that it has arrived in a very densely populated area, and the risk that the whale may be injured due to human contact has become significantly greater,” it added.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Fisheries Director Frank Bakke-Jensen said that “so far there have only been minor incidents where the whale has suffered minor injuries, primarily from contact with boats.”\n\nBut he urged people to keep their distance, “even though the whale is tame and used to being around people.”\n\n“We especially encourage people in boats to keep a good distance to avoid the whale being injured or, in the worst case, killed by boat traffic,” said Bakke-Jensen.\n\nGiven the dangers, Bakke-Jensen was asked whether the whale should be placed in captivity.\n\n“We have always communicated that the whale in question is a free-living animal and we see no reason to capture it and put it behind barriers,” he said.\n\nHowever, now that the whale is “in a more vulnerable area and access to food may be limited, we will consider different measures,” added Bakke-Jensen. “But it is too early to say anything concrete about that yet.”', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'Agent Hvaldimir checking in.\n\nI have been spotted by the Norwegian government.

We're going to be regularly updating this page with good news about our planet in an effort to combat climate anxiety.

Eco-anxiety, climate doom, environmental existential dread - as green journalists, we see these terms used a lot - and often feel them ourselves.

While there's a lot to be worried about when it comes to the climate and nature crises, we must not lose hope - because hopelessness breeds apathy.

The media has an important role to play in combatting climate doom. It's our job to be truthful and accurate in our reporting, not trying to downplay or greenwash the situation. But it's also our job to show that there is hope.

In 2022, as part of our ongoing effort to tackle eco-anxiety (both that of our readers and our own), we kept track of all the positive environmental news throughout the year - racking up over 100 stories of eco-innovation, green breakthroughs and climate wins.

In 2023, we're confident the good news will keep on coming, as renewable power soars, vulnerable ecosystems gain rights, and climate protocols start to pay dividends.


This article will be regularly updated with the latest good news. It may be something small and local, something silly that made us smile, or something enormous and potentially world-changing.

Refill stores and bottle deposit schemes: Inside the UN goal to cut plastic pollution by 80% by 2040
Plastic pollution could be slashed by 80 per cent by 2040, according to a new report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).

This ambitious target relies on major policy changes and the deployment of existing technologies in the way we produce, use and dispose of plastics.

Here's what would need to change in our daily lives to reach it.

Spain, Sweden and Belgium: The European countries setting new wind and solar records

"Briefly explain what B.A.R.K. is and list the benefits of using therapy dogs for online classes.

For college students, stress relief can take many forms online: shopping, ordering food, gaming with friends and meeting new romantic partners. And now they can add hanging out with therapy dogs to that list. Virtual canine comfort is emerging as a successful way for students to reduce their stress as they interact with therapy dog-handler teams.

Because they are nonjudgmental, engaging and welcoming, interacting with therapy dogs can be used as a complementary intervention that reduces student stress which may encourage students to seek more formal support services if needed. Once introduced on campus, the interest from students typically surpasses most programs’ abilities to meet the demand.

Even prior to COVID-19, being a college student was considered a stressful experience; college administrators have increasingly been seeking innovative ways to encourage students to safeguard their mental health. Spending time with therapy dogs is one proactive way for students to chip away at potentially debilitating levels of heightened stress.

In-person canine visitation programs or canine-assisted interventions are themselves a relatively new way for students to enhance their well-being. Programs such as the University of British Columbia’s Building Academic Retention through K9s (B.A.R.K.) program at the Okanagan campus was established in 2012 as a way for students to reduce their homesickness, decrease their stress and foster interpersonal connections.
Analysis of the world, from experts

Several randomized controlled trials out of the B.A.R.K. lab, and elsewhere, now attest to the efficacy of spending time with therapy dogs to elicit a host of well-being outcomes.

Restrictions on in-person sessions saw the B.A.R.K. program collaborate with human-animal interaction researcher Christine Tardif-Williams’ pre-recorded virtual canine comfort modules.

We set out to conceptualize, design and deliver a series of virtual canine comfort modules that mirrored, as close as possible, the experience of students in an in-person canine visitation session. These sessions consisted of a trained dog-handler team following a script that saw handlers welcome students and encourage reflection around stress reduction and mindfulness. Students were also asked to reflect on their social support networks.

Students could access these modules remotely, which support the well-being of students who are geographically isolated or in areas where well-being resources are overtaxed or nonexistent.

The modules are posted online on a platform that students (and others) can access without needing to sign-up for an appointment or join a waitlist.
The University of British Columbia’s B.A.R.K. program studies how canine therapy can support students and others.
Stress reduction

Prior to releasing these modules, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess how the modules would affect students’ self-ratings of stress. We assigned 467 undergraduate students to either synchronous (via Zoom) or asynchronous (pre-recorded YouTube videos) five-minute sessions that invited them to observe a dog—handler team or a handler-only condition.

We assessed well-being before and after the sessions using measures like anxiety, loneliness, connections to others, positive and negative affect. We found that all students, regardless of condition, reported significant pre-to-post improvements in self-reports of most well-being measures. However, the conditions in which the therapy dog was present elicited the most significant reduction in self-reports of stress.

Although additional research is needed, these initial findings are encouraging. They support the contention that, for students for whom attending in-person sessions are not an option, accessing virtual canine therapy modules can offer a momentary reduction in stress.

Unlike in-person sessions that are scheduled at the convenience of program personnel, virtual canine comfort modules may be accessed as needed by students. Further, college instructors can make use of virtual canine comfort modules as part of “brain breaks” incorporated into a lecture to encourage students to reflect on, and take care of, their well-being.",005a80ac04a8832c1214e9b17f3172f762ca2b01a7c01bcaf2f5ac887f5e7a3e,"[{'content': 'Briefly explain what B.A.R.K. is and list the benefits of using therapy dogs for online classes.\n\nFor college students, stress relief can take many forms online: shopping, ordering food, gaming with friends and meeting new romantic partners.

What are 5 excercises to build bigger arms in the gym?,aaa339e3dc745ed407a2090a1b5f3be519601809a394ed3c0092fc58a7689050,"[{'content': 'What are 5 excercises to build bigger arms in the gym?', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': ""Here are five exercises you can do to grow your arms. \n\n1. Dead hang pull-up. \nThe dead hang pull-up is a variation of the standard pull-up and is excellent for working your biceps. Start by grabbing a pull-up bar underhanded so your palms are facing you. Your arms should be about shoulder-width apart. Hold your weight, cross your legs behind your body, and raise your feet slightly so your knees are bent. This is your starting position. To perform the exercise, pull yourself up so that your collarbone is in line with the bar. The trick to performing this exercise is to lower yourself at a slower pace. About 4 seconds will be best. Now repeat until you are unable to do any more. \n\n2. Rolling skull crusher with press. \nStart by lying on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand, raised straight above your chest. Now allow your elbows to bend so that the dumbbells fall beside your head in a controlled manner. Now reverse this motion so that the dumbbells are in the original position and perform a press like a bench press. Once you have completed all these motions, that's considered one rep. This exercise works your triceps and chest, so it's versatile when trying to build muscle. You can use a Swiss ball instead of a bench for more difficulty. This will work your abs as well. \n\n3. Drag curl.\nEveryone knows that curls help to build your biceps and arms in general. This exercise is no different in that sense but is performed with some differences. Start by holding the barbell with a shoulder-width, underhand grip. Now you should pull your shoulders down and back. When doing this, you should drag the bar up the front of your body, keep your elbows around, and slowly lower the barbell. To work slightly harder, try using dumbbells instead of a barbell. \n\n4. Grasshopper pushup.\nLike curls, pushups are renowned as an excellent exercise for building muscle and strength. This variation pays particular attention to your arms. To perform this exercise, get in a standard pushup position, but instead of having your palms open, use your fists to stabilize yourself.  The inside of your hands should be facing each other. Once in this position, you perform a pushup as usual by lowering your chest to the ground and pushing back up to start. If this hurts your fists, you can face your fingers out to work the same muscles. \n\n5. Supinated cable row. \nTo perform this exercise, you will need a cable station. Use the low pulley on the cable station and attach a straight bar. Using an underhand grip, shoulder width apart, row the bar towards your belly button and return with control. Keep your hips back and your stance soft so that your torso is around 45 degrees angle to vertical. You can also do this with a barbell once you have mastered the exercise with the cable station.

"Rewrite the article with comedic twist.

Mosquitoes bite, suck your blood, and leave you with itchy bumps and possibly a horrible infection. Mosquito-borne pathogens include malaria, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Chikungunya virus, and dengue.

While you might fantasize about living in a mosquito-free world, eradicating them would actually be disastrous for the environment. Adult mosquitoes are food for other insects, birds, and bats, while larval mosquitoes support aquatic ecosystems. The best we can hope for is to limit their ability to transmit disease, repel them, and kill them within the confines of our yards and homes.

Mosquito-killing products bring in the big bucks, so it should come as no surprise that there is a wealth of misinformation out there. Before you get sucked into buying a product that simply won't work, get educated about what does and does not kill these blood-sucking pests.

First, you need to understand the difference between repelling mosquitoes and killing them. Repellents make a location (like your yard or skin) less attractive to mosquitoes, but don't kill them. So, citronella, DEET, smoke, lemon eucalyptus, lavender, and tea tree oil might keep the insects at bay, but won't control them or get rid of them in the long run. Repellents vary in effectiveness, too. For example, while citronella may deter mosquitoes from entering a small, enclosed area, it doesn't really work in a wide open space (like your back yard).

There are a host of methods that actually do kill mosquitoes, but aren't great solutions. A classic example is a bug zapper, which kills only a few mosquitoes, yet attracts and kills beneficial insects that keep the mozzy population down. Similarly, spraying pesticides is not an ideal solution because mosquitoes can become resistant to them, other animals get poisoned, and the toxins can cause lasting environmental damage.

Many species of mosquitoes required standing water to breed, so one of the most effective methods of controlling them is to remove open containers and repair leaks. Dumping containers of standing water kills the larvae living in them before they get a chance to mature.

However, removing water may be undesirable or impractical in some cases. Further, some species don't even need standing water to reproduce! The Aedes species, responsible for transmitting Zika and dengue, lays eggs out of water. These eggs remain viable for months, ready to hatch when sufficient water becomes available.
A better solution is to introduce predators that eat immature or adult mosquitoes or infectious agents that harm mosquitoes without affecting other wildlife.

Most ornamental fish consume mosquito larvae, including koi and minnows. Lizards, geckos, dragonfly adults and naiads, frogs, bats, spiders, and crustaceans all eat mosquitoes.

Adult mosquitoes are susceptible to infection by the fungi Metarhizium anisoplilae and Beauveria bassiana. A more practical infectious agent is the spores of the soil bacterium Bacillus thurigiensis israelensis (BTI),. Infection with BTI makes the larvae unable to eat, causing them to die. BTI pellets are readily available at home and gardening stores, easy to use (simply add them to standing water), and only affect mosquitoes, black flies, and fungus gnats. The treated water remains safe for pets and wild animals to drink. The disadvantages of BTI are that it requires reapplication every week or two and it doesn't kill adult mosquitos.
There are several chemical methods that target mosquitoes without the risks to other animals that come with spraying pesticides.

Some methods rely on chemical attractants to lure mosquitoes to their doom. Mosquitoes are attracted to carbon dioxide, sugary scents, heat, lactic acid, and octenal. Gravid females (those carrying eggs) may be attracted to traps laced with a hormone released during the egg-laying process.

The lethal ovitrap is dark, water-filled container, typically with a small opening to prevent larger animals from drinking the water. Some traps use chemicals to bait the traps, while others simply provide a convenient breeding ground. The traps may be filled with predators (e.g., fish) or with dilute pesticide to kill larvae (larvicide) and sometimes adults. These traps are highly effective and affordable. The disadvantage is that multiple traps must be used to cover an area (about one every 25 feet).

Another chemical method is the use of an insect growth regulator (IGR), added to water to inhibit larval development. The most common IGR is methoprene, which is supplied as a time-release brick. While effective, methoprene has been shown to be mildly toxic to other animals. 

Adding a layer of oil or kerosene to water kills mosquito larvae and also prevents females from depositing eggs. The layer alters the surface tension of the water. Larvae can't get their breathing tube to the surface for air, so they suffocate. However, this method kills other animals in the water and makes the water unfit for consumption.
One example of a physical method of killing mosquitoes is swatting them with your hand, a fly-swatter, or an electric swatter. Swatting works if you've only got a few mosquitoes, but it's not particularly helpful if you're being swarmed. While bug zappers aren't ideal outdoors because they can unnecessarily kill beneficial insects, electrocuting indoor insects isn't generally considered objectionable. Just remember, you need to bait a bug zapper to attract mosquitoes, because they don't care about the pretty blue light.

Because mosquitoes are not strong fliers, it's also easy to suck them onto a screen or into a separate trap using a fan. Mosquitoes caught using a fan die from dehydration. Screen-traps may be made at home by fastening window screening fabric over the back of a fan.",da4403b6d03c77120c44a63ab1629fda74ec6f32e9789f776c41866a40428065,"[{'content': ""Rewrite the article with comedic twist.\n\nMosquitoes bite, suck your blood, and leave you with itchy bumps and possibly a horrible infection.

What a delight! We all dream of a world free from these buzzing nuisances, but believe it or not, getting rid of them would be a total disaster for the environment.\n\nYou see, adult mosquitoes are like fast food for other insects, birds, and bats. They\'re the all-you-can-eat buffet for the insect world! And let\'s not forget about the larval mosquitoes. They play a crucial role in supporting aquatic ecosystems. So, as much as we despise them, the best we can do is limit their disease-spreading abilities, repel them, and kill them within the comfort of our yards and home.\n\nNow, brace yourself, because mosquito-killing products are a gold mine. And where there\'s money to be made, there\'s bound to be a plethora of misinformation. Don\'t fall victim to the charade of useless products! It\'s time to get educated on what works against these bloodthirsty critters.\n\nFirst things first, we need to understand the difference between repelling mosquitoes and straight-up obliterating them. Repellants, like citronella, DEET, and all those fancy-sounding oils, make your location [like your yard or your skin] less enticing to mosquitoes. But let\'s get real here, they won\'t kill the little buggers or solve the problem in the long run. It\'s like trying to keep your annoying neighbour at bay with a strongly scented candle. It might work for a while, but eventually, they\'ll come back, uninvited and ready to ruin your evening.\n\nNow, for methods that claim to kill mosquitoes. Brace yourselves for disappointment because they aren\'t all that great.  Take big zappers, for example. Sure, they\'ll fry a few mosquitoes, but they\'ll also take down some beneficial insects that help keep the mosquito population in check. Oops, collateral damage.\n\nAnd let\'s not forget about spraying pesticides. Sure, it sounds like a solid plan, but mosquitoes can quickly become resistant to these chemicals, Plus, another innocent creature ends up getting poisoned, and the long-term environmental damage is no joke. So, unless you\'re aiming to create a mutant army of super mosquitoes, let\'s skip the pesticide party. \n\nNow, here\'s a tip that actually works. Many mosquitoes breed in standing water, so removing open containers and fixing leaks is an effective way to control them. It\'s like hitting the nursery where it hurts! Dumping the water-filled mosquito cribs kills the larvae before they have the chance to mature and ruin your summer nights.\n\nBut it isn\'t always that simple. Some mosquitoes are so crafty that they don\'t even need standing water to reproduce. Take the Aedes species, responsible for Zika and dengue, for example. These little troublemakers lay eggs outside of water, just waiting for the perfect opportunity to hatch. They\'re like spy agents of the mosquito world.\n\nSo, what can we do? Well, how about unleashing the power of nature? Introduce predators that feast on immature or adult mosquitoes. We\'re talking about lizards, geckos, dragonflies, frogs, bats, spiders, and crustaceans. It\'s like assembling a superhero team to battle the forces of evil [or in this case, itchy bumps and diseases.\n\nWe can infect those bloodsuckers with fungi, bacteria, and other agents that make them regret ever messing with us. For example, adult mosquitoes can fall victim to fungi like Metarhizium anisoplilae and Beauverua bassiana. Talk about a fungal infection they\'ll never forget! and if you prefer something more practical, try infecting them with Bacillus thurigiensis israelensis [BTI], a bacterium that ruins their appetite and leads them to demise. It\'s like serving them a deadly dinner they won\'t be able to resist.\n\nNow, let\'s talk about chemical warfare against mosquitoes, minus the risks to other innocent critters. Some clever methods use chemical attractants to lure mosquitos to their demise. It\'s like setting up a mosquito trap disguised as a five-star restaurant, complete with irresistible delicacies. \n\nAnd have you heard of lethal ovitrap? It\'s like a mosquito nightclub that no female mosquito can resist. It\'s a dark, water-filled container with a small opening to keep out party crashers. Some traps use chemicals as bait, while others provide the perfect breeding ground. You can invite predators or add a dash of pesticide to the mix. Talk about throwing wild party mosquitoes will regret attending!\n\nBut wait, there\'s more! We have the insect growth regulator [IGR], a chemical that ruins the larvae\' development. It\'s like giving them a taste of the ""you shall not grow\' potion. However, we must admit, it has a slight downside- it\'s mildly toxic to other creatures. \nOops!\n\nNow, here\'s a method that\'s straight out of a slapstick comedy. Get ready to swat those bloodsuckers with your bare hands, a fly swatter, or an electric swatter. Swatting works like magic when you\'re dealing with just a few mosquitoes. But if you\'re facing a full-on mosquito invasion, well good luck with that! It\'s like trying to fight an army of tiny vampires armed with a rolled-up newspaper. Let\'s just say the odds aren\'t in your favour.\n\nOh, and did I mention that mosquitoes aren\'t the brightest when it comes to flying? That\'s right! You can easily suck them onto a screen or a trap using a fan. It\'s like the ultimate mosquito vortex! Those suckers caught in the wind will meet their demise due to dehydration. As for the screen traps, you can create your very own DIY version by attracting window screen fabric to the back of a fan. It\'s like setting up a mosquito-themed escape room, with no escape in sight.\n\nSo there you have it, folks! The hilarious battle against mosquitoes. Remember, these bloodsuckers may be annoying, but they provide a buffet for other insects and support aquatic ecosystems. Our best bet is to repel them, limit their disease transmission, and maybe unleash a few predators or infect them with a touch of nature\'s wrath. And if all else fails, well, at least you can enjoy a good laugh while swatting them away with a fly swatter or watching them get trapped in your DIY fan-powered vortex.

And while that's a great way to get introduced to the game, that paddle will only take you so far. If you're a beginner whose skills are leveling up to intermediate and you're looking for a paddle to match, here are 3 things to consider:\n\n- Weight.\nMost beginner's paddles are light because they offer the most control over the ball. But as your skills increase, you might feel like the lightweight paddle is preventing you from putting as much power into the ball as you'd like. We suggest leveling up to a mediumweight paddle (7.3 - 8.4oz.) for a great balance of control and power.\n\n- Material.\nThere are three common materials used to make pickleball paddles: wood, graphite, and composite. Most beginner's paddles are made with wood because it's cheap and very durable, but they're also the heaviest option and don't offer much in terms of performance. We recommend trying a composite paddle. Composite paddles are usually made from carbon fiber and have composite cores. Their lighter weight makes them easier to handle, and the textured surface will help you generate more spin on the ball. \n\n- Grip Size. \nIncorrect grip size can lead to pain and injuries, especially as you begin playing more often. Find your ideal pickleball grip by measuring the distance from the tip of your ring finger to the middle crease of your paddle hand. The length of that measurement is your pickleball grip size. When looking for a racket, look for a paddle with a grip this length or shorter. Shorter grips are favored by some players because they offer more opportunities for wrist action on shots.\n\nHave more questions about how to improve your game?

The newly discovered moons of Saturn are classified as ""irregular moons."" This term refers to objects that are believed to have been captured by a planet's gravitational influence and end up orbiting it on large, flattened or ""elliptical"" paths that are more inclined in comparison to the orbits of regular moons. 

Saturn now has 121 known irregular moons along with its 24 regular moons. Irregular moons like these new ones tend to bunch up in groupings depending on the tilt of their orbits. Saturn's system currently hosts three of these groupings — the Inuit group, the Gallic group and the densely populated Norse group, all of which take their names from different mythologies. 

All of the newfound moons of Saturn fall into one of these three currently existing groupings. Three of the new moons belong to the Inuit group, but the majority fit in the Norse group.

The moons in these three groups are believed to have been created when larger moons around Saturn originally captured by the gas giant slammed together and fragmented. Investigating the orbits of Saturn's irregular moons could help astronomers better understand the history of such collisions in the gas giant system.

The team behind the new discovery thinks that the large number of tiny moons in a retrograde orbit around Saturn (that is, opposite in direction to the planet's orbit) is evidence of a collision between irregular moons around the gas giant as recently as 100 million years ago. This collision is believed to have created the moons in the Norse group. 

""As one pushes to the limit of modern telescopes, we are finding increasing evidence that a moderate-sized moon orbiting backward around Saturn was blown apart something like 100 million years ago,"" team member and University of British Columbia astronomer Brett Gladman said in the same statement.

Jupiter leap-frogged Saturn for the moon crown in February 2023 when 12 new moons were found around the solar system's largest planet, bringing the total number of known Jovian moons to 92.

But the moon title is not set in stone; it could change hands again as astronomers' techniques for discovering moons continue to improve.",4b1d813a36b6299da53057e61e10ac137cc4ccac124d412b5d24748caebf68fa,"[{'content': 'Rewrite this article in a style that would suit a science fiction novel.\n\nThe newly discovered moons of Saturn are classified as ""irregular moons.""

As someone who has always liked to travel and see new places and have new experiences, as I've gotten older, I really really appreciate slower travel. Our situation is obviously different than for someone who is just traveling long-term since we are also working remotely. \n\nWe adapted quite quickly to waking at the same time every day, having coffee on the balcony, going to the gym after work, cooking dinner, working Monday-Friday, and then relaxing on the weekend, just in a postcard-worthy location! These are all things that aren't necessarily possible when on the move all of the time.\n\nEven when going about your routine as a foreigner in any country, it's all still pretty new and exciting anyways. I was surprised to find that the routine itself was the exciting part. My daily commute in Lanta was either a short scooter ride or walking along the beach at sunset. We had a couple of local bars and restaurants we liked visiting that the workers began recognizing us at. We spent the majority of our time there at a very cool co-working space that we just loved. I had a favorite desk and break time area, I knew where everything was, and even I reached a point where I had some new friends to stop and have a chat with at the water cooler. It was like the best office setup ever but without the stress and office politics.\n\nWe've both decided that from now on, we'll stay in places for a month at a time at a minimum. Though it's possible to focus and get work done in a ferry terminal, airport, minivan, or train with a reliable wifi connection (or hotspot in most cases), it's just nicer to do it at a desk!

"Make a comma-separated list of all jobs or occupations mentioned in the following article that are affected by products containing toxic chemicals.
Here is the article to reference:

Consumer products released more than 5,000 tons of chemicals in 2020 inside California homes and workplaces that are known to cause cancer, adversely affect sexual function and fertility in adults or harm developing fetuses, according to our newly published study.

We found that many household products like shampoos, body lotions, cleaners and mothballs release toxic volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, into indoor air. In addition, we identified toxic VOCs that are prevalent in products heavily used by workers on the job, such as cleaning fluids, adhesives, paint removers and nail polish. However, gaps in laws that govern ingredient disclosure mean that neither consumers nor workers generally know what is in the products they use.

For this study we analyzed data from the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which tracks VOCs released from consumer products in an effort to reduce smog. The agency periodically surveys companies that sell products in California, collecting information on concentrations of VOCs used in everything from hair spray to windshield wiper fluid.

Analysis of the world, from experts
We cross-referenced the most recent data with a list of chemicals identified as carcinogens or reproductive/developmental toxicants under California’s right-to-know law, Proposition 65. This measure, enacted in 1986, requires businesses to notify Californians about significant exposure to chemicals that are known to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harms.

We found 33 toxic VOCs present in consumer products. Over 100 consumer products covered by the CARB contain VOCs listed under Prop 65.

Of these, we identified 30 product types and 11 chemicals that we see as high priorities for either reformulation with safer alternatives or regulatory action because of the chemicals’ high toxicity and widespread use.


Why it matters
Our study identifies consumer products containing carcinogens and reproductive and developmental toxicants that are widely used at home and in the workplace. Consumers have limited information about these products’ ingredients.

We also found that people are likely co-exposed to many hazardous chemicals together as mixtures through use of many different products, which often contain many chemicals of health concern. For example, janitors might use a combination of general cleaners, degreasers, detergents and other maintenance products. This could expose them to more than 20 different Prop 65-listed VOCs.

Similarly, people experience aggregate exposures to the same chemical from multiple sources. Methanol, which is listed under Prop 65 for developmental toxicity, was found in 58 product categories. Diethanolamine, a chemical frequently used in products like shampoos that are creamy or foamy, appeared in 40 different product categories. Canada and the European Union prohibit its use in cosmetics because it can react with other ingredients to form chemicals that may cause cancer.

Some chemicals, such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and ethylene gylcol, are listed under Prop 65 because they are reproductive or developmental toxicants. Yet they appeared widely in goods such as personal care products, cleansers and art supplies that are routinely used by children or people who are pregnant.

Our findings could help state and federal agencies strengthen chemical regulations. We identified five chemicals – cumene, 1,3-dichloropropene, diethanolamine, ethylene oxide and styrene – as high-priority targets for risk evaluation and management under the Toxic Substances Control Act by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

What still isn’t known
Our analysis of the CARB data on volatile toxicants does not paint a complete picture. Many toxic chemicals, such as lead, PFAS and bisphenol A (BPA), don’t have to be reported to the Air Resources Board because they are not volatile, meaning that they don’t readily turn from liquid to gas at room temperature.

In addition, we were not able to identify specific products of concern because the agency aggregates data over whole categories of products.

What other research is being done
Studies have shown that women generally use more cosmetic, personal care and cleaning products than men, so they are likely to be more highly exposed to harmful chemicals in these categories. Further, women working in settings like nail salons may be exposed from products used both personally and professionally.

Research by members of our team has also shown that product use varies by race and ethnicity, partly due to racialized beauty standards. Policy interventions could be tailored to prioritize these potentially more-highly exposed groups.

Ultimately, a right-to-know law like Prop 65 can only go so far in addressing toxics in products. We’ve found in other research that some manufacturers do choose to reformulate their products to avoid Prop 65 chemicals, rather than having to warn customers about toxic ingredients.

But Prop 65 does not ban or restrict any chemicals, and there is no requirement for manufacturers to choose safer substitutes. We believe our new analysis points to the need for national action that ensures consumers and workers alike have safer products.",5d111125d02e9d2c35a88c2417e4e27fb16caf5ffd744636b7949845b102995a,"[{'content': 'Make a comma-separated list of all jobs or occupations mentioned in the following article that are affected by products containing toxic chemicals.\nHere is the article to reference:\n\nConsumer products released more than 5,000 tons of chemicals in 2020 inside California homes and workplaces that are known to cause cancer, adversely affect sexual function and fertility in adults or harm developing fetuses, according to our newly published study.\n\nWe found that many household products like shampoos, body lotions, cleaners and mothballs release toxic volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, into indoor air.

And yet, breaking into the industry has never been more challenging. Before even landing a paying gig, filmmakers are expected to master cinematography, sound, camera work, script development, editing, and more. \n\nThe good news is that today\'s most successful filmmakers are eager to share their secrets. If you have Hollywood aspirations, you\'d be wise to heed their advice. Here are five must-know tips for aspiring filmmakers:\n\n1. Film school won\'t boost your career.\nSure, theater or film school graduates have some valuable technical knowledge. But according to Hollywood titans like Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan, and Quentin Tarantino, a diploma isn\'t your ticket to stardom. Each of these legendary filmmakers is completely self-taught.\n\n2. Don\'t be afraid of being typecast. \nWhile everyone aspires to be a writer, director, or producer, it may be wise to spend some time in one of the many crucial behind-the-scenes roles. As long as you\'re working on set, you\'re gaining valuable experience. So don\'t skip jobs in departments like PR, costume, sound, location, etc.\n\n3. Build your portfolio, not your resume\nThe most common piece of advice given by filmmakers is some variation of ""show, don\'t tell"". Don\'t wait for the right moment or the right team - just get a camera and start shooting. Your resume will not be nearly as important to producers as your portfolio.\n\n4. Don\'t watch movies, study them.\nQuentin Tarantino famously said, ""I didn\'t go to film school, I went to movies."" Instead of just watching a movie, try to see it from the filmmaker\'s perspective. Spend time researching the team\'s interviews, watching the director\'s commentary, and studying the concepts they discuss. \n\n5. Networking is Key\nOne thing has remained true throughout the history of show business. It\'s not what you know, it\'s who you know. Developing a strong and diverse professional network should be a top priority for any aspiring filmmaker. And the best way to connect with people in the industry is to network at events for up-and-coming writers, producers and directors. In a few years, these people could be your first collaborators.', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Generation
"Turn the facts in this text into a series of questions with answers

Two plaintiffs, Kiersten Hogan and Elizabeth Weller, had their water break prematurely, but were both told to wait until they were sick enough to receive abortion care, according to a draft of the suit.

Hogan was allegedly told that if she tried to leave the hospital to seek care elsewhere she could be arrested for trying to kill her baby, according to a draft of the suit. She was kept in the hospital until she went into labor four days later in the hospital bathroom and delivered her son stillborn.

“I was told that if I tried to discharge myself or seek care elsewhere, that I could be arrested for trying to kill my child. I wanted this baby, so of course I stayed,” Hogan said at a press conference.

“When I needed to use the bathroom, I was accompanied and watched and made sure that I didn’t push,” Hogan said.

Hogan called the experience the most traumatic and heartbreaking experience of her life.

“At every turn, staff reminded me how alone I was and how unmarried I was. I was made to feel less than human,” Hogan said.

Weller had to wait until she developed an infection before a hospital approved her abortion despite her losing almost all her amniotic fluid, which a pregnancy is not viable without, according to a draft of the suit.

“My doctor told me that due to a new Texas law, my request for an abortion had been denied. Now, I was left with one of two options, each cruel and inhumane. I could either stay in a hospital to wait for my baby to die, at which point I could get the abortion I needed to protect my health, or I could go home and wait for either my daughter’s death or for an infection to develop that might cause my own demise,” Weller said at a press conference Monday.

“My baby would not survive and my life didn’t matter. And there was nothing I could do about it,” Weller said.",3c66eb3d5c29c28eaa8a8276e98f9b4497eeddbe5b6db14aab432c1946790824,"[{'content': 'Turn the facts in this text into a series of questions with answers\n\nTwo plaintiffs, Kiersten Hogan and Elizabeth Weller, had their water break prematurely, but were both told to wait until they were sick enough to receive abortion care, according to a draft of the suit.\n\nHogan was allegedly told that if she tried to leave the hospital to seek care elsewhere she could be arrested for trying to kill her baby, according to a draft of the suit.

Although people didn’t believe he was right for the job, after the first film came out, the masses were mad at Keaton as \n   Batman. \n- Kevin Conroy: Technically the most accurate Batman to date, Kevin Conroy gave Batman the voice every actor has used since. \n- Val Kilmer: Though some say that Val Kilmer was a good Batman, many felt as though he was no Michael Keaton and were unimpressed with the sudden change. \n- George Clooney: In 1997, George Clooney was nowhere near as famous as he is now, and while his role as Batman certainly didn’t hurt his career, it also didn’t do anything to further it as everyone who watched it \n   seemed to hate it. \n- Christian Bale: By the time Christian Bale came into the role, audiences didn’t expect much from Batman actors. And although his bat voice was considered imperfect in many ways, Bale’s rendition of the character \n   generally got better reviews than most of the others who took on the role. \n- Will Arnett: Most people don’t realize that Will Arnett played Batman in The LEGO Movie, but those who did see him in the role absolutely loved his comedic take on the superhero. \n- Ben Affleck: When word got out that Ben Affleck was to play Batman in the new film Batman vs. Superman, audiences were hesitant to get excited. However, the general consensus now is that Affleck excelled in the \n   role due to his rugged good looks and charm. \n- Robert Pattinson: Playing the role very differently than anyone before, Pattinson made Batman the strange orphan he actually was, and once again, although no one thought he would excel in the role, he surprised \n   bat-fans everywhere with his take on the character.

"Can you give me a tl;dr on why the debt ceiling debate could put health insurance in jeopardy for millions?

Here is the article:

As Republicans and Democrats debate a plan to raise the nation’s debt ceiling, millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid for their health insurance have wound up in the crosshairs. 

Republicans and Democrats appear to be at a stalemate over a GOP proposal to tie eligibility for Medicaid, the government-funded health insurance program for low-income and disabled adults, to a certain number of hours worked each month. For Republicans, the plan is part of a decadeslong push to link federal assistance to work requirements, while Democrats say the move would unfairly strip people of their health coverage and push more Americans into poverty.

Under the Republican plan, included in a bill passed by the House last month, Medicaid recipients would have to document 80 hours a month of work, which at the federal minimum wage would amount to a minimum of $580 a month in income, or log hours doing community service or participating in a work training program. Recipients would lose their coverage if they don't meet the hourly or monthly income requirements for three consecutive months during the year. 

A number of groups would be exempt, including people under 19 years old or over 56, those who are going to school at least part-time or who are pregnant or deemed by a doctor to be physically or mentally “unfit for employment.” Also exempt from the work requirement would be people participating in a drug or alcohol program and those caring for a dependent child or an “incapacitated person.”",ffc98686f035528f7107e5f47b17b26ffd75b7b18d7d4c9693afc4ae4f17c16f,"[{'content': ""Can you give me a tl;dr on why the debt ceiling debate could put health insurance in jeopardy for millions?\n\nHere is the article:\n\nAs Republicans and Democrats debate a plan to raise the nation’s debt ceiling, millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid for their health insurance have wound up in the crosshairs. \n\nRepublicans and Democrats appear to be at a stalemate over a GOP proposal to tie eligibility for Medicaid, the government-funded health insurance program for low-income and disabled adults, to a certain number of hours worked each month.

Choose colors that remind you of calmness and peace. \n\nFor many people, various shades of blue or purple are calming colors.

It can be any color that evokes a peaceful brain response. While you don’t have to flood your bedroom with that singular color, a few splashes in pillows, blankets, and even on the walls could have a safe, comforting effect on your brain and body. \n\n2. What’s your “perfect storm” for a good night’s sleep? \n\nAs everyone’s calm colors are different, so are everyone’s ideas of an ideal sleep space. While some people love complete darkness and a cold bedroom with a fan on high throughout the year, others are happier and sleep better with a nightlight in a quiet room of warm, still air. It’s a personal preference, often associated with the ways you slept growing up. Ergo, it could be a catalyst for better sleep and a calmer mind as an adult too. \n\nIt may take trial and error, but work on discovering the environment that is most conducive to your calm state of mind and a good night’s rest. Once you’ve found your “perfect storm” of peace, it should be easier to create a cozy, calm environment in the bedroom. \n\n3. Bring nature into the bedroom with crystals, a vase of flowers, or windowsill succulents. \n\nNature is balance, and finding balance in your bedroom could mean reminding yourself of the equilibrium found in nature. For instance, you could add greenery with windowsill succulents, or bring a bloom of color onto your nightstand with a fresh vase of flowers. \n\nInto the mystical side of nature? Crystals are symbolic of inner feelings and your psyche, so invest and display crystals that represent what you want. For instance, black tourmaline repels negative energies, while amethyst encourages good dreams and deeper sleep. \n\n4. Engage your senses with softness and soothing scents. \n\nCalmness and peace are felt across all of your senses, so engage in those before bedtime. You could, for example, invest in a sound machine for the gentle lull of ocean waves or a cacophony of cicadas and crickets to remind you of your childhood. You could also surround yourself with softness, like plush pillows and luxurious blankets atop crisp, clean sheets. \n\nAnother way to invite calm into your bedroom is with the right scents. Lavender is naturally soothing to the mind, while vanilla is a subtle, mellow fragrance that transports your brain back to simpler, peaceful times. \n\nYou don’t have to douse your pillows and blankets but use a room spritz to liven the air or do the same with a candle. Just don’t forget to blow out the candle before you doze off. \n\n5. The less clutter in your bedroom, the less clutter in your mind before bedtime. \n\nClutter of your safe space is clutter of your mind because when the clutter becomes too much, your brain will latch onto the worry and responsibility of eventually having to clean and organize everything cluttered. It’s a thought that can keep you awake at night! \n\nUse your day to declutter and organize your bedroom. The less worry you give yourself, the better sleep you’ll have, and the calmer your mind will be. Remember that the aim here is to create a haven for yourself. \n', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

In fact, the Mining, Minerals and Sustainable Development Project reports that copper recycling needs to increase to around 100 percent before the end of the twenty-first century if we are to have the copper necessary for industry and commerce. \n\nThe worldwide demand for copper is growing because of the many new products coming out every year, like PDAs, smartphones, pad computers, laptops, and many other electronics. The circuit boards on many of these devices require copper, so recycling copper wire isn’t just a good idea; it’s imperative.\n\nFor these reasons, copper recycling has become a big business. Copper doesn’t break down or disintegrate over time like aluminum and other metals. It retains its good properties for many years and can easily be melted down for use in all sorts of industries. Copper wire is one major area where recycling has really grown in the last few years. \n\nThis is good news for those who have copper wiring they don’t need anymore. You can help the planet out and make some money on the side. Copper wire retains its value, but all copper recyclers are not the same. Some are a bit on the shady side and will use faulty scales that weigh your copper light, so they don’t have to pay the full amount. It’s best to deal with a reputable copper recycler in your area that has a good name. It also helps to know the current copper prices. The more you know, the better your chances of not being taken advantage of.\n\nFiguring the Weight & Value of Copper Wire\nFirst, strip the copper wire so that you remove all surrounding plastic. Regardless of what the copper was previously used for, it may have rubber or plastic around it that was acting as a ground. Once the copper is clean, weigh it. Commercial scales are the most accurate, but a good set of home scales can work.', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Generation

"Rewrite this and change the text for someone who had a brain injury and has a hard time processing complex sentences, but wants to start gardening as a form of therapy.

1. Get to know your garden
Before you start, it's a good idea to get to know your garden. Check the aspect – is it south-facing or north-facing? Knowing where the sun hits the ground will help you decide what to grow where. It's also worth knowing what soil type you have. Take a look at what's growing – camellias, magnolias and pieris will tell you the soil is acidic, while absence of these suggests a more alkaline soil. Doing a soil test will further help you know your soil, and therefore what plants you can grow.

2. Plan your garden
Sitting down and planning your garden is a great starting point. This way you can work out what to grow where, rather than getting carried away at the garden centre and ending up with a jumble of plants that don't look good together and might not suit your growing conditions. Planning will also enable you to use colour and structure wisely, which will help you create a garden that looks great throughout the year.

3. Learn how to plant
Planting your plants properly will ensure they grow well and live for a long time. Make sure you take time to weed and prepare the soil before planting, and add mulch or fertiliser where necessary. If you're unsure how to plant something, look online for instructions rather than just hoping for the best. Trees planted too deeply will never thrive, and root-balls that sit proud of the soil surface will dry out quickly, leading to the eventual death of the plant.

4. Feed and water plants regularly
Knowing when and how to water plants is the difference between them living and dying. As a general rule, water the root ball rather than the leaves, as it's the roots that absorb the water. Soaking the rootball every week is better than watering a little bit every day. Feeding is also important - generally you should be looking at feeding every fortnight during growing season (that's spring and summer), although you will need to feed more if growing in containers.

5. Start small
When starting a new veg patch or allotment, it can be tempting to take it all on in one go. It's much better to do a little bit at a time. You can easily cover areas you don't want to cultivate with cardboard or black plastic, to stop weeds growing, while you work on a different area.

6. Keep an eye on pests
Most garden pests don't do much harm to plants and can be left alone - there are plenty of natural predators that will keep them in check. However, sometimes pest populations can become an infestation, and you need to act. Keeping an eye out for increasing numbers of pests like aphids, slugs and snails, will help keep your plants safe, and save you a lot of heartache.

7. Make use of compost

Let the waste break down for a year and then use it as a mulch around the base of plants in your garden and veg patch.",e728ceac5a4e4725b46b05e296d031dd401b14b7ccfb1b3f51c575e1f7e66611,"[{'content': ""Rewrite this and change the text for someone who had a brain injury and has a hard time processing complex sentences, but wants to start gardening as a form of therapy.\n\n1.

It\'s something that you need to consider and feel confident discussing very early on in your freelance career.\n\nFor some reason, for many freelance writers, it\'s uncomfortable to put a price on their worth, and sadly many freelancers sell themselves short. Obviously, it\'s important to consider your knowledge, skills, and experience, but price yourself with what you are comfortable earning so that you will continue to be motivated to keep up your freelance writing business for the long term. \n\nHere are some simplified steps to help you set your freelance writing rates. \n\n1. Start with some online research. It\'s good to get a grasp on what people are paying in your industry or niche. If you don\'t have one, that\'s fine too! Seeing the differences in pay may be a factor to consider if you\'re thinking of choosing a niche. You can go to any of the freelance job platforms you\'re now a part of to see what clients are listing their budget as (even though it\'s not always listed), what other writers\' rates are, and their level of experience/background. \n\n2. Consider your professional and educational background. Even if you are new to freelance writing, any relevant experience can set you apart from others and provide a reason to charge a higher rate. This has its limits obviously, you must have the skill to back it up. If you have a degree in English or journalism, that sets you apart. Obviously, if you don\'t have a writing background or other credentials, this doesn\'t mean that you can\'t be a freelance writer, it just means that you may have to start at a lower rate until you have successfully completed a few projects and have some good reviews under your belt. \n\n3. Consider the budget of potential clients. It\'s important to know what clients you are targeting. If you want to take on a client with a startup business, they will likely offer lower pay because that may be all that\'s in the budget. If you target more established businesses or individuals to write for, there may be more room for negotiation on your rate or the project cost. \n', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Generation

    Obstacles in meditation are not a problem, they are the path to finding freedom amidst it all. – Jack Kornfield

No matter what form of meditation we practice, sooner or later inner obstacles will arise. They arise naturally when we stop our busy lives and bring attention to our inner experience. On first becoming quiet we will can encounter the unfinished business we carry. There may be untended longings, unacknowledged grief, unrequited hopes, unexpressed love or our underlying fears and hurts. And as we get quieter still we can find ourselves facing the mystery of our own mortality, of death. In all spiritual traditions as attention is given to these problems, our understanding and compassion deepens, for it is through these that the path often unfolds. As my teacher Ajahn Chah used to say, “Where do you learn the most, when times are easy or when times are hard?”

In the Christian mystical tradition, The Dark Night of the Soul by St. John of the Cross talks about the periods of loneliness, fear, and doubt that one goes through after the initial awakenings into the light. Evagrius, a fourth-century Christian monk who lived in the Egyptian desert with the Christian Desert Fathers wrote a text describing the demons that come to people who go into the desert to undertake a meditation practice. These include the demons of pride, the demons of fear, the demons of lust, the noonday demon of laziness and so forth. In Zen, there are descriptions of further kinds of obstacles that arise in intense meditation. Practitioners might experience makyo. These are hallucinations involving vision, hearing, smell, or other senses.

How does one understand and work with these difficulties? Buddhist teachings say begin right where you are, with the most common hindrances such as physical pain and restlessness, anger, doubt and fear. Instead of resisting or trying to get rid of them, which usually keeps them stuck, you can name and acknowledge them kindly and surround them with mindfulness and compassion. Make space for them and soften around them. Breathe and become a loving witness. Invite them to open and show you their dance. As you let them open without resistance, they soften or disperse or transform into other energies. But not always. Sometimes they become quite intense for a time, but without resistance and a patient curiosity they will eventually change. They always do. And with this practice you learn a deep trust. You find that awareness can hold it all. You become the spacious awareness itself. Then as meditation deepens beyond the everyday level, even the more extreme, delightful or terrifying energies, visions, mental states, and difficulties become workable.

To find freedom requires a steadying of the heart, a trust in attention, a willingness to be present for it all. Like the sign in a Las Vegas casino that says, “You must be present to win”, the very obstacles that arise become your place to awaken.

Obstacles are bound to arise when we try to slow down our busy lives and think more critically about ourselves and our inner experience. We might discover some unfinished business our thoughts wander to. We might feel longing, grief, unexpressed love, underlying fear and hurt, or unrequited hopes. And when we really stop to analyze what is going on in our thoughts, we may even face the mystery of our own mortality. Anxious thoughts about death may be buried in there. But as we deepen our attention to these aspects of our thoughts, our understanding and compassion for ourselves and others can deepen, too. We forget we can learn the most from something that was hard, rather than something that was easy. \n\nWhen we begin a journey of therapy or deep self-reflection to heal the wounds in our minds, it is not uncommon for loneliness, fear, and doubt to emerge. We may also be forced to confront our pride, lust, laziness, and so on. Instead of resisting those feelings and moods or being surprised when they occur, we can name and acknowledge what they are in a kind way and look at them both objectively for what they are and also with compassion. Witness them, rather than feeling like you have to be subject to their will. If you don't encounter them with resistance, your mind and body can relax and the thoughts and feelings may begin to disperse. In this process, you are shifting your mindset from one that feels afflicted by these thoughts and emotions to one that looks at them more objectively, like studying clouds and watching them pass by. Sometimes, the emotions are very intense, and we won't make progress over night. But with diligent patience and curiosity, change will eventually happen. What you are really doing in this process is learning trust. You are trusting that these feelings can arise and that it is going to be okay. You are becoming more skillful about what thoughts and emotions drive your actions and mood, and which ones don't need to, including the most extreme, delightful, and terrifying thoughts. \n\nIn confronting the wounds of our mind and lives, we also discover freedom. But to do so, we must trust the process, remain patient, and be willing to investigate the deepest darkest parts of our mind.

Courgettes.\nCourgettes are an easy vegetable to grow at home. Start by planting in late May using the well-prepared ground. You should find that just one or two plants are enough to grow to produce for several weeks. \n\n2. Beetroot.\nBeetroot is a popular thing to grow in England. You can plant beetroot from late April all the way through July. Sow beetroot seeds about 5cm apart, and be sure to remove roots that are only half-grown to avoid them interfering with the rest. You don't have to waste these half-grown roots, as they can be used in small salads. \n\n3. Chillies. \nChilies pack a flavourful punch and are great to grow at home. Start by researching chilies that are a good flavor and heat for you. Simply plant them in a large tough and use a can to support the chilies as they grow. Once you have enough, you can also store them for a long time. \n\n4. Dwarf french beans. \nTo grow Dwarf french beans, plant in either open ground or a container. These beans should be planted from mid-May to early August. You don't need to support this crop, so they are pretty low maintenance. You should bear produce in around 3-4 weeks, so maintain a planting schedule every three weeks to ensure you never run out.\n\n5. Potatoes.\nPotatoes grow really easily in just a large pot or alternatively can be grown just as well in a large compost bag. It is as easy as adding potato seeds to a layer of compost and covering it with more compost. From there, just wait for leaves to appear, which you must cover again with more compost.\n\n6. Strawberries. \nStrawberries are extremely low maintenance, with a single crop growing fresh strawberries for up to 4 years. All you need to do is a small clean-up of the plant each spring. \n\n7. Radish.\nRadishes are one of the best and easiest crops to grow at home. Radishes grow extremely quickly, too, which is a great way to start growing at home before moving on to higher-maintenance produce. "", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

"Sum this up for me in one paragraph with 6 sentences. It's about the Tulsa Race Massacre.


Governor James B. A. Robertson had gone to Tulsa during the riot to ensure order was restored. Before returning to the capital, he ordered an inquiry into events, especially of the City and Sheriff's Office. He called for a Grand Jury to be empaneled, and Judge Valjean Biddison said that its investigation would begin June 8. The jury was selected by June 9. Judge Biddison expected that the state attorney general would call numerous witnesses, both black and white, given the large scale of the riot.[120]

State Attorney General S.P. Freeling initiated the investigation, and witnesses were heard over 12 days. In the end, the all-white jury attributed the riot to the black mobs, while noting that law enforcement officials had failed in preventing the riot. A total of 27 cases were brought before the court, and the jury indicted more than 85 individuals. In the end, no one was convicted of charges for the deaths, injuries or property damage.[121]

On June 3, a group of over 1,000 businessmen and civic leaders met, resolving to form a committee to raise funds and aid in rebuilding Greenwood. Judge J. Martin, a former mayor of Tulsa, was chosen as the chairman of the group. He said at the mass meeting:

Tulsa can only redeem herself from the country-wide shame and humiliation into which she is today plunged by complete restitution and rehabilitation of the destroyed black belt. The rest of the United States must know that the real citizenship of Tulsa weeps at this unspeakable crime and will make good the damage, so far as it can be done, to the last penny.[120]
Many black families spent the winter of 1921–1922 in tents as they worked to rebuild. Charles Page was commended for his philanthropic efforts in the wake of the riot in the assistance of 'destitute blacks'.[122]

A group of influential white developers persuaded the city to pass a fire ordinance that would have prohibited many black people from rebuilding in Greenwood. Their intention was to redevelop Greenwood for more business and industrial use and force black people further to the edge of the city for residences. The case was litigated and appealed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court by Buck Colbert Franklin, where the ordinance was ruled unconstitutional. Most of the promised funding was never raised for the black residents, and they struggled to rebuild after the violence. Willows, the regional director of the Red Cross, noted this in his report, explaining his slow initial progress to facilitate the rehabilitation of the refugees. The fire code was officially intended to prevent another tragedy by banning wooden frame construction houses in place of previously burnt homes. A concession was granted to allow temporary wooden frame dwellings while a new building, which would meet the more restrictive fire code, was being constructed. This was quickly halted as residents within two weeks had started to erect full-sized wooden frame dwellings in contravention of the agreement. It took a further two-month delay to secure the court decision to reinstate the previous fire code. Willows heavily criticized the Tulsa city officials for interfering with his efforts, for their role in the Public Welfare Committee which first sought to rezone the ""burned area"" as industrial, and for constructing a union station in its place with no consideration for the refugees. Then he criticized them again for the dissolution of the Public Welfare Committee in favor of the formation of the Reconstruction Committee which failed to formulate a single plan, leaving the displaced residents prohibited from beginning reconstruction efforts for several months.[123]",337b717c1f272ab85cb27f6cb1ffc7fd07560f7812ac6be8acffb57d5d57c6c3,"[{'content': 'Sum this up for me in one paragraph with 6 sentences.

"Rewrite the article and explain the process of mouthbrooding in a simple way, so primary school children can understand it.

Why these fish mothers cannibalise their babies

Some African cichlid fish raise their young in their mouths—and snack on them. Now, scientists may have figured out the reason.

Raising babies can be exhausting—so much so that some mouthbrooding mothers snack on their young, according to a new study.

A central African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni—commonly called Burton’s mouthbrooder—sometimes consumes more than three-quarters of their own eggs and baby fish.

Proper Axolotl Aquarium Size
Since axolotls are bottom-feeding animals, the height of their aquarium is not as important as the length and width of it. Reaching an adult size of up to 10 inches in length or more, your axolotl needs plenty of room to turn around and fully extend its body in any direction. If an axolotl’s habitat is too small, it can cause stress for the animal, which can lead to health problems in the long term.

To accommodate the lifelong growth of your pet, we recommend nothing smaller than a 30 or 40-Gallon Breeder tank, along with a lid to prevent the axolotl from jumping out of its enclosure (it’s happened before!). This is a common aquarium size and they are readily available at most pet stores and fish shops.
Axolotl Aquarium Filtration

Axolotls evolved in the relatively still waters of Lake Xochimilco in the valley of Mexico. Therefore, you should avoid using filters and equipment that produce a high amount of water flow and surface agitation in your axolotl’s aquarium.

At the same time, axolotls also produce a significant amount of waste which can quickly pollute their water if there is inadequate filtration in the tank. Canister filters, hang-on-back filters, and internal filters with adjustable flow rates are all ideal—providing three types of filtration (mechanical, biological, and chemical) to help your axolotl thrive.

Another benefit of these three types of filters is that they allow you to aim the filtered water towards the surface of the tank. This helps prevent a buildup of debris and small particles from accumulating and creating a glossy film on the surface of the water.

A less expensive option, while not as effective, is a sponge filter. Although they lack chemical filtration, they still provide adequate mechanical and biological filtration as long as they are large enough to accommodate the filtration load of the aquarium and its resident(s).

Sponge filters will collect debris, waste, and other free-floating particles while simultaneously supplying plenty of surface area for beneficial bacteria to develop.

Filters do not eliminate the need for regular maintenance. All aquariums require routine maintenance to keep them running at their optimal performance, and to keep the animals living there happy and healthy. Practicing a regular water change routine and performing regular water tests is essential to make sure your axolotl’s environment is as comfortable and healthy as possible. There are many filter options available on the market. Here are some we recommend based on our many years of experience keeping aquatic animals:",88056c5c3bdcd77f52c1a6ca7a71b147a2a064ec5615a7c414dc7077f505416b,"[{'content': 'Change this article to a list of instructions.\n\nProper Axolotl Aquarium Size\nSince axolotls are bottom-feeding animals, the height of their aquarium is not as important as the length and width of it.

The sea turtle population has been in a state of rapid decline due to human interference. Marine pollution has been a major factor in the drop in the sea turtle population. Things like sewage disposal, oil spills, and toxic waste are harming the reptile group greatly. In addition to this, there are 100 million tons of plastic in our oceans, 80% of which comes from people. Many turtles are killed or injured due to plastic trash alone but the harm that is being done to this aquatic reptile doesn't stop there. About 250, 000 turtles have been captured, injured, or killed by fishermen, often even by accident. Fishing nets used to catch other ocean creatures have captured many sea turtles by mistake. The nets keep the turtles held underwater and cause them to drown. According to the data, the issue is very severe. One species in particular, the leatherback, has had its population decline by 40% in the past three generations according to the NOAA. \n\nNeedless to say, something must be done about our precious sea turtle population. Nearly all species of sea turtles have made their way onto the endangered species list. Some steps we could take to try and reverse this catastrophe include participating in coastal cleanups, reducing the rate at which we use single-use plastics, and even conserving the water we use at home. Those are things we can all do as individuals to help. However, we must also hold corporations that dump toxic waste into the ocean accountable. Although it is illegal in most places to dump waste into the ocean, that does not stop it from happening.

Turtles are not the only sea creatures harmed by these atrocities, they are simply the most affected. I hope my essay inspires whoever reads it to make changes in their everyday lives to help our endangered turtle friends as well as all of the other ocean creatures impacted by marine pollution and the other factors I mentioned to continue to survive.

History of Earth Day
Celebrate Earth Day with these tips for helping our environment.
BY ROSE DAVIDSON
Our planet is an amazing place, but it needs our help to thrive! That’s why each year on April 22, more than a billion people celebrate Earth Day to protect the planet from things like pollution and deforestation. By taking part in activities like picking up litter and planting trees, we’re making our world a happier, healthier place to live.
The first Earth Day was celebrated in 1970, when a United States senator from Wisconsin organized a national demonstration to raise awareness about environmental issues. Rallies took place across the country and, by the end of the year, the U.S. government had created the Environmental Protection Agency. By 1990, Earth Day was an event celebrated by more than 140 countries around the globe.

You can celebrate and protect the planet at the same time. Check out these Earth Day ideas to help save the planet any time of year.

BECOME A WASTE WARRIOR
 The number of garbage trucks Americans fill each year would stretch halfway to the moon. Toilet paper tubes, made from cardboard, take two months to decompose in a landfill. A plastic bottle sticks around for way longer—it can take over 450 years to break down! But instead of turning to the trash bin, you could turn these items into an awesome telescope or a flower planter. Before you throw something away, think about whether it can be recycled or repurposed. You can also limit waste by reducing the amount of things you buy. For example, check the library for that book you have to read before visiting the store.

PLANT A TREE
Researchers estimate roughly 15 billion trees in the world are cut down each year, so help offset that loss by planting a tree of your own. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen for people to breathe. They also provide shelter and food for animals such as squirrels and owls. Depending on where trees are planted, their shade can even reduce the need for air-conditioning in hotter months. How many more reasons do you need to go green?

TURN OFF THE LIGHTS
Does that lamp really need to be on while the sun is out? Electricity doesn’t just happen—it has to be produced from things around us. A lot of times it comes from fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, or natural gas) that contribute to climate change. But electricity can also be made from renewable sources like wind, water, the sun, and even elephant dung! No matter where it’s coming from, try conserving electrical energy by using only what you need.

LIMIT YOUR WATER USAGE
Turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth can conserve up to eight gallons of water a day.
It might seem like it’s everywhere, but clean, drinkable water is a limited resource. In fact less than one percent of the water on Earth can be used by humans. (The rest is either too salty or too difficult to access.) Turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth can conserve up to eight gallons of water a day. To help save even more water, challenge yourself to take a shorter shower (but still get clean!).

OFFER YOUR TIME
With a parent’s permission, volunteer to pick up trash at a nearby park, start a collection drive for recyclable items, or organize a screening of an environmentally themed movie. By getting involved and working with others, you’re not just helping the Earth—you’re making new friends too!

SPREAD THE MESSAGE

That’s why each year on April 22, more than a billion people celebrate Earth Day to protect the planet from things like pollution and deforestation. By taking part in activities like picking up litter and planting trees, we’re making our world a happier, healthier place to live.\nThe first Earth Day was celebrated in 1970, when a United States senator from Wisconsin organized a national demonstration to raise awareness about environmental issues. Rallies took place across the country and, by the end of the year, the U.S. government had created the Environmental Protection Agency. By 1990, Earth Day was an event celebrated by more than 140 countries around the globe.\n\nYou can celebrate and protect the planet at the same time. Check out these Earth Day ideas to help save the planet any time of year.\n\nBECOME A WASTE WARRIOR\n The number of garbage trucks Americans fill each year would stretch halfway to the moon. Toilet paper tubes, made from cardboard, take two months to decompose in a landfill. A plastic bottle sticks around for way longer—it can take over 450 years to break down! But instead of turning to the trash bin, you could turn these items into an awesome telescope or a flower planter. Before you throw something away, think about whether it can be recycled or repurposed. You can also limit waste by reducing the amount of things you buy. For example, check the library for that book you have to read before visiting the store.\n\nPLANT A TREE\nResearchers estimate roughly 15 billion trees in the world are cut down each year, so help offset that loss by planting a tree of your own. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen for people to breathe. They also provide shelter and food for animals such as squirrels and owls. Depending on where trees are planted, their shade can even reduce the need for air-conditioning in hotter months. How many more reasons do you need to go green?\n\nTURN OFF THE LIGHTS\nDoes that lamp really need to be on while the sun is out? Electricity doesn’t just happen—it has to be produced from things around us. A lot of times it comes from fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, or natural gas) that contribute to climate change. But electricity can also be made from renewable sources like wind, water, the sun, and even elephant dung! No matter where it’s coming from, try conserving electrical energy by using only what you need.\n\nLIMIT YOUR WATER USAGE\nTurning off the faucet when you brush your teeth can conserve up to eight gallons of water a day.\nIt might seem like it’s everywhere, but clean, drinkable water is a limited resource. In fact less than one percent of the water on Earth can be used by humans. (The rest is either too salty or too difficult to access.) Turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth can conserve up to eight gallons of water a day. To help save even more water, challenge yourself to take a shorter shower (but still get clean!).\n\nOFFER YOUR TIME\nWith a parent’s permission, volunteer to pick up trash at a nearby park, start a collection drive for recyclable items, or organize a screening of an environmentally themed movie. By getting involved and working with others, you’re not just helping the Earth—you’re making new friends too!\n\nSPREAD THE MESSAGE\nTalk to your friends and family members about what you’re doing and ask them to help. Need to get the conversation started? Get everyone together and reconnect with nature by taking one of our Get Outside challenges, or check out some other green tips you can share. The more people do, the better off our planet will be!\n\n', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'Earth Day is celebrated every year by more than a billion people across the globe on April 22nd.

A man in Virginia who illegally caught and sold turtles across the United States has pleaded guilty to conducting a trafficking scheme that made him thousands of dollars and sent many of the animals to Asia, where they are in high demand as pets, the Justice Department said Monday.

The man, Stanlee Fazi, 41, of Louisa, Va., pleaded guilty in federal court to trafficking turtles from July 2017 to June 2020. During that time, he collected Eastern box turtles — which have bright yellow or orange markings on their cocoa-colored shells — and shipped them to buyers in the United States.

Many of the animals were then sold to people in Hong Kong and China, where the illegal pet turtle trade is booming, prosecutors said. Turtle populations there are in decline because of their use in the pet trade, in Asian folk medicines and as food.

Mr. Fazi admitted that he had bound the turtles in socks and shipped them via FedEx from Fredericksburg, Va., making about $12,700 in the scheme, the Justice Department said in a news release. He will be sentenced in July and faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Mr. Fazi’s lawyer, Edward J. Ungvarsky, said in a statement that his client “loves turtles and publicly sold a small number of turtles that he found over several years to fellow aficionados here in the United States.”

“He never intended for any of them to be sent to Asia,” Mr. Ungvarsky added.

Virginia law prohibits the taking and selling of any turtle species from the wild; it is a federal crime to violate state wildlife laws.

Indeed, many species of turtles in Asia are endangered, and climate change and habitat destruction have made their futures even more dire, according to the University of Hawaii. Conservationists have described the phenomenon as the “Asian turtle crisis.”

But the shipments of Eastern box turtles to Asia have contributed to the species’ decline in the United States. The Eastern box turtles are also an invasive species in Asia and may spread disease there.

A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service investigation found that at least 1,500 native turtles — including wood turtles, spotted turtles and Eastern box turtles — were illegally smuggled to Asia between June 2017 and December 2018.

The illegal pet trade in the United States has led some to believe that the underground market is an easy way to make money, said Crawford Allan of the World Wildlife Fund, an expert on international wildlife trafficking and trade. The premise, he said, seems simple: You find turtles outside, collect them and sell them online.

“What we have found is that it is so easy to put things on social media without detection,” Mr. Allan said in an interview.

Mr. Fazi deployed that social media strategy in his scheme, according to prosecutors.

Court records show that on July 26, 2017, he posted on Facebook Marketplace’s “Virginia Reptile Classifieds” that he was “looking for any and all box turtles. Message me and let me know what you have.”

Such open queries are typical in the illegal turtle trade, Mr. Allan said, because people “can avoid detection” easily. Sometimes they change keywords with emojis or with code words when trying to communicate in a sale, he said.

Facebook, which prohibits such transactions on its site, is one of the major platforms that is being taken advantage of in the exotic pet trade, Mr. Allan said.

“It’s so difficult to tell the difference between somebody just showing a nature video” or someone trying to sell an exotic animal by being clever in their messaging, Mr. Allan said. He noted, though, that detection is improving because of more sophisticated algorithms.

Some of Mr. Fazi’s most financially lucrative sales involved “screamer” Eastern box turtles, which are highly desired because of their vibrant coloration. They can have streaks of red and yellow on shells dazzled with dots and bright red eyes.

Mr. Fazi offered to sell a pair of screamers for $400, according to prosecutors.

In one message to a customer that appeared in court records, Mr. Fazi boasted that he had a lot of screamers in his possession.

Pretend that you are a chicken.

Write an email to Kentucky Fried Chicken requesting in a logical fashion that they switch to selling a different meat.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'To whom it may concern:\n\nI am writing in protest of decades of your company\'s sole focus on one protein group:  chicken.\n\nWhen Colonel Sanders started your company, he clearly had a bias against fowl. What else could explain his decision to single out chicken protein while overlooking valuable other meats like beef and pork from his restaurant\'s menu? Seafood is also an excellent protein source. Some consider snails a delicacy!\n\nThe truth of the matter is that the public perception of chickens has been changing in recent years. You can now find beautiful specimens of my species adorning dishtowels, metal signs, and wall decor. Some clearly enlightened people adopt chickens as part of their families, even dressing them in trendy outfits and accessories. Elaborate coop designs are available online for owners who want to keep their highly-esteemed chickens living a life of luxury.\n\nWhen making decisions about which species to feature on your menu, KFC is not taking into account the generous contributions cows make to the proper fertilization of the soil. Protecting the environment is a top-of-mind issue for many consumers, and just imagine the goodwill it could garner from your company switching to farming cows!\n\nAnd let\'s take a look at pork. Pigs will eat almost any kind of food waste you provide. They aren\'t particular. You could give them the prior day\'s leftover mashed potatoes and coleslaw and they\'d be, well, as happy as pigs! Pork lends itself to some tasty menu variations, like pickled pigs\' feet and pig snouts. In fact, doesn\'t ""Kentucky Fried Pig Snouts"" have a ring to it? Plus, there\'s an added benefit to switching to pig protein:  dogs love to eat pigs\' ears, and that would offer you an avenue into a completely new market.\n\nOther proteins have positive selling points, too. Fish can be farmed in ponds capable of containing many fish in a relatively small footprint of real estate. Dig the pond as deep as you\'d like. And think about how little space it would take to raise snails!\n\nIn closing, I believe Kentucky Fried Chicken needs to revisit its antiquated business practice of selling chicken. There are other wonderful protein substitutes available that are more earth-friendly, offer added revenue streams, and offer a more efficient use of space.\n\nRespectfully,\n[Chicken Name]', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Generation

What are some techniques i can use when negotiating. This will be concerning my pay.,2ee6596786403e0e0b19c2a92f6c6c88a57fa2e1aea77de922c9aec4f35c1ce7,"[{'content': 'What are some techniques i can use when negotiating. This will be concerning my pay.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': ""Here are five tips to use when negotiating your pay. \n\n1. Know your worth.\nBefore entering negotiations regarding your pay, you must know what you are worth. Knowing what you are worth to a company will give you a base for negotiations. It can be tough to see what you are worth to your company, but luckily, you can use sites like glassdoor.com and payscale.com to get a better idea of what people in similar roles and companies to you do earn. This knowledge will mean you can confidently suggest a number in line with the market rate. Offering a rate identical to others in your field will allow you to have confidence that the company will not be able to find someone better without at least paying an equal rate. Hiring new staff is often tedious and not cost-effective, so forcing your employer into this decision can work in your favor. \n\n2. Use good timing. \nTiming is everything in negotiations, which is never more true than in salary negotiations. Utilizing good timing can be the difference between a successful salary negotiation and an awkward conversation with your boss. Try to initiate salary negotiations while the company is doing well and you are being seen to impact that success substantially. A salesman who isn't hitting targets regularly would be ill-advised to open negotiations regarding salary. It may be that they can get a higher wage but unlikely to be sufficient if they don't have the data to back up their claimed performances. If you've just completed a profitable project and been a key player, it's probably a great time to strike while the iron is hot and ask for a pay rise. \n\n3. Be realistic.\nIt is necessary to know your worth and understand your value to a company, but remaining realistic is also pivotal. If you aim for the stars and ask for 50% more than you are worth, you can expect your employer to grow frustrated and unsympathetic to your request. The better tactic is to have a number in mind you would like, then add a small % to it so that you can work down to your ideal number. This will allow your employer some wiggle room to negotiate and feel they are not being played. It is essential to back your realistic request up with why you deserve it and what others are getting. \n\n4. Don't ask too often. \nAs stated above, alienating and frustrating your employer is not a good idea. If you do this, you risk no negotiations and just a simple no. This will leave you in no better position than you were before. That is precisely why it is essential not to ask too frequently for a pay rise. Think of a similar situation in the car when a child asks the parents are we there yet over and over. The parents become frustrated and eventually will stop answering. The same will happen with your employer. They will revert to a standard no answer if you continuously ask for something. Instead, be sure to research what you are worth and strike while the iron is hot, as we described in point 2. \n\n5. Don't be afraid to ask. \nIt seems silly to put this point straight after point 4. However, the fact is valid and should be discussed. While asking too often is not advised, not asking at all will probably get you nowhere. While this can't be said for all companies, most are reluctant to hand out pay raises regularly and will wait until they are asked or forced. That's why it is crucial that if you feel you deserve a pay rise and the circumstances dictate one, you stand up for yourself and ask. The worst thing they can say is no. If you don't think you deserve a pay raise, that's fine. Don't ask till you do. But if you have been stuck at the same rate for years and are integral to our company's operations, then speak up and ask for your worth. \n"", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

This is the kind of stuff I drink when winding down for the day. Haha!\n• The real stuff (70-150mg): coffee! Pretty much a baseline of measurement for caffeine with 80-120mg of caffeine per cup. It's about the same in serving amounts for espresso, iced coffee, Americanos, and lattes.\n• Harder. Stronger (150-230mg): stronger coffee! Coffee, such as the way Starbucks brews it, is made with less water and will have more caffeine. Also, cold brews (the ones you sit in the fridge overnight) will be around this range too. Yum!\n• Kickin' and Screamin'! (250-400mg): the strongest energy drinks will reach this. For example, a 24 oz big can of Monster will have 240mg! A 16 oz can of Bang Energy is 300mg as well!

"Rewrite this technical review in a way that a layman can understand.

You no longer have to spend more than $500 to get a video card using NVIDIA's current Ada Lovelace architecture. The company is launching the GeForce RTX 4060 series, which will start at $299. The flagship RTX 4060 Ti will start at $399 with 8GB of RAM when it arrives on May 24th — a full $200 less than the base 4070. It's pitched as a direct successor to the similarly-priced RTX 3060 Ti and 2060 Super, and aimed at gamers who are more interested in high frame rates at 1080p than a high resolution.

The RTX 4060 Ti is a noticeable step down from the 4070 with 4,352 CUDA cores (versus 5,888) and a 128-bit memory interface (versus 192-bit). It's a mixed bag versus its predecessor. While the 3060 Ti has more cores and a much wider 256-bit interface, Ada, DLSS 3 upscaling and a clock speed boost (2.3GHz base compared to the old card's 1.4GHz) theoretically help the 4060 Ti deliver more actual computing power, particularly for ray tracing and tensor-based tasks. It uses less power, too, with an ""average gaming power"" of 140W instead of the 3060 Ti's 197W.

NVIDIA claims a roughly 15 percent average performance increase at 1080p over the 3060 Ti in games that don't use DLSS 3's frame generation, and 70 percent for those that do. You'll unsurprisingly get high 1080p frame rates in competitive titles like Counter-Strike 2 (330FPS) and Overwatch 2 (260FPS).",422ffb2384e64d6f97e5cb614a3a809ff94c4843c089452bae4b300107ffc8c0,"[{'content': 'Rewrite this technical review in a way that a layman can understand.\n\nYou no longer have to spend more than $500 to get a video card using NVIDIA\'s current Ada Lovelace architecture.

"Convert the tips about seeing bears in residential areas of Florida into a FAQ document.

FLORIDA — The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is reminding Floridians to be aware of their surroundings as bears become more active this time of year.

If you live in an area with more bears, follow these preventative measures to keep your family and your home safe:

1: Never feed or approach bears

Feeding bears can make them lose their natural fear of people.

It is illegal in Florida to intentionally feed bears or leave out food or garbage that will attract bears and cause conflicts.

Getting close to a wild animal is dangerous.

2: Secure food and garbage

Store garbage in a sturdy shed or garage, and then put it out on the morning of pickup rather than the night before.

If not stored in a secured building, modify your existing garbage can to make it more bear-resistant or use a bear-resistant container.

Secure commercial garbage in bear-resistant dumpsters.

Protect gardens, beehives, compost and livestock with electric fencing.

Pick ripe fruit from trees and bushes, and remove fallen fruit from the ground.

3: Remove or secure bird and wildlife feeders

Remove wildlife feeders.

If wildlife feeders are left up, only put enough food out for wildlife to finish eating before dark and make feeders bear-resistant.

4: Never leave pet food outdoors

Feed pets indoors.

If feeding pets outdoors, only put food outside for short time periods and bring in leftover food and dishes after each feeding.

5: Clean and store grills

Clean and degrease grills and smokers after each use.

If mobile, store them in a secure shed or garage.

6: Alert neighbors to bear activity

If you see a bear, let your neighbors know.

Share tips on how to avoid conflicts with bears.

Encourage your homeowner’s association or local government to institute bylaws or ordinances to require trash be kept secure.

If you want to report someone who harming bears or intentionally feeding them, call the FWC’s Wildlife Alert Hotline at 888-404-FWCC (3922).

"Rewrite this article. Make the first couple of paragraphs about what Multichain is.

Worries about the stability of Multichain and its total value locked (TVL) of $1.5 billion, sparked a major sell-off of the project’s token, MULTI, yesterday.

The panic was triggered by a tweet claiming that users were reporting delays in receiving assets across the bridge and that an insider was dumping tokens. 

A transfer of almost 500,000 MULTI (worth approximately $3.2 million at the time) was made from an address suspected to be either a Multichain team member or an investor. The tokens, which hadn’t been touched since they were first received over a year ago, were sent to the centralized exchange Gate.io, where users inferred they would be sold off.

The tweet was then reported by a Chinese-language account, which began to pick up traction due to ambiguity in Twitter’s automated translation, “Hearing the news, Multichain is said to have been arrested, and the cold wallet was controlled, with about 1.5B of funds.”

Rumors then began to spread that the team had been apprehended by Chinese authorities and that assets locked in the bridge may be compromised.

Multichain had published an announcement the day before, warning that certain routes would face delays due to a back-end upgrade; however, the team’s communications in response to the worries left much to be desired.

Eight hours after 0xScope’s original tweet, Multichain responded to the rumors with a statement of its own which only led to more questions:

While most of the cross-chain routes of Multichain protocol are functioning well,  some of the cross-chain routes are unavailable due to force majeure, and the time for service to resume is unknown. After service is restored, pending transactions will be credited automatically. Multichain will compensate users who are affected during this process, and the compensation plan will be announced later.

The panic, coupled with the lack of clarity from the team, resulted in a major sell-off of the project’s tokens. The price of MULTI, which had already been dropping since the weekend, fell from around $6.50 to below $4.90 at the time of writing.

Today, users are still waiting on a more detailed statement from the team, MULTI continues to drop in price, and Binance has announced a temporary suspension of deposits for certain Multichain assets.
Blockchain bridges hold $10 billion in assets

Multichain is a source of popular DeFi tokens, such as WETH and USDC, on chains where such tokens are not natively deployed. This means that the value of Multichain tokens on these other chains is derived solely from their counterparts locked in the Ethereum side of the bridge.

The blockchain most dependent on Multichain-backed assets is Fantom. Almost 200 million USDC, 230 million of other stablecoins (MAI, fUSD, and DAI), and $50 million worth of WETH on Fantom are Multichain tokens, according to the project’s dashboard. 

If Multichain were to be compromised (or hacked, as happened in 2021 before a rebrand from Anyswap) the bridged tokens would rapidly become worthless without their mainnet backing.

Blockchain bridges hold a combined $10 billion in assets, making them the fourth largest category of DeFi protocol, according to DeFiLlama. They are critical infrastructure for moving assets between blockchains, each of which is a closed system.

Here are some non-dairy post-workout supplement ingredients that you should consider adding to your regimen:\n\n1. Leucine: It’s an essential amino acid that plays a key role in building and repairing muscle tissue after a workout. It also activates the body's protein synthesis pathway, allowing for optimal muscle growth. Leucine can be found in protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, and beans, but supplementing with it can help enhance muscle protein synthesis and promote muscle recovery.\n\n2. Creatine: Creatine is widely considered the most effective muscle-building supplement. It’s a compound produced naturally in the body that helps produce ATP – the primary source of energy for muscle cells. In short, it can boost power and strength after your workouts, which would allow you to lift heavier weights and perform more reps afterward, ultimately leading to increased muscle mass.\n\n3. Beta-alanine: It’s a non-essential amino acid, but it contributes to the production of carnosine, which acts as a buffer to prevent acid buildup in the muscles after your exercise. That, in turn, delays muscle fatigue and can improve future workout performance, particularly after high-intensity exercises such as weightlifting or sprinting.\n\n4. Spirulina: Spirulina is a nutrient-dense blue-green alga that is rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals, making it a popular supplement among athletes and fitness enthusiasts. It has also been shown to reduce inflammation in the body and enhance endurance. It would make a valuable addition to your post-workout regimen.\n\nIncorporating these supplements into your post-workout fitness routine can optimize muscle growth and recovery, improve workout performance, and enhance overall health and well-being."", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

"Turn the facts in the passage into a series of five questions with answers to be used in a quiz for American high school sophomores in a world history class.

George V was the second son of Edward VII. His mother was Alexandra of Denmark, sister of Empress Marie of Russia. He joined the Royal Navy aged 12 and served until 1892 when he became heir to the throne on the death of his elder brother Albert, Duke of Clarence, who died of pneumonia.

In 1893, he married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck (known as ‘May’ to her family) who had previously been engaged to his brother. They became Duke and Duchess of York and lived on the Sandringham Estate, in Norfolk. The marriage was a success and George unlike his father never took a mistress. They had 6 children Edward, Albert, Mary, Henry, George and John. The youngest Prince John suffered from epilepsy and died aged 13.

He became King George V on the death of his father Edward VII in 1910, and Mary became Queen Consort. They toured India in 1911 as Emperor and Empress of India. During World War I he made several visits to the front, and Mary visited wounded servicemen in hospital. She was a staunch supporter of her husband during difficult times that included not only the war with Germany, but also the Russian Revolution and the murder of George’s cousin Princess Alix who was Tsarina Alexandra, wife of Tsar Nicholas II, civil unrest including the General Strike in England, the rise of socialism, and Irish and Indian nationalism. George V has been criticized for not rescuing the Russian Royal family but at the time there was serious concern that it would incite a similar revolution in the UK. He sent a ship in 1922 to rescue the Greek Royal family including 1 year old Prince Philip.

In 1917 with anti-German sentiment running high, he changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (popularly known as Brunswick or Hanover) to Windsor, and he relinquished all German titles and family connections. George V enjoyed stamp collecting and although considered dull by biographers he became by his Silver Jubilee in 1935 a much loved King. In 1932 he started the tradition of the Royal Christmas broadcast which has continued ever since. His relationship deteriorated with his eldest son Edward (later Edward VIII) when he failed to settle down and had affairs with married women, but he was fond of his second son Albert (“Bertie” later George VI) and his granddaughter Elizabeth (later Elizabeth II) whom he called ‘Lilibet’. She called him ‘Grandpa England’.

"Please summarize the main points of the text about Axon's independent AI ethics board and the challenges of balancing business objectives with responsible digital practices.

In 2018, Rick Smith, founder and CEO of Axon, the Scottsdale, Arizona-based manufacturer of Taser weapons and body cameras, became concerned that advances in technology were creating new and challenging ethical issues. So, he set up an independent AI ethics board made up of ethicists, AI experts, public policy specialists, and representatives of law enforcement to provide recommendations to Axon’s management. In 2019, the board recommended against adding facial recognition technology to the company’s line of body cameras, and in 2020, it provided guidelines regarding the use of automated license plate recognition technology. Axon’s management followed both recommendations.

In 2022, the board recommended against a management proposal to produce a drone-mounted Taser designed to address mass shootings. After initially accepting the board’s recommendation, the company changed its mind and, in June 2022, in the wake of the Uvalde school shootings, announced it was launching the taser drone program anyway. The board’s response was dramatic: Nine of the 13 members resigned, and they released a letter that outlined their concerns. In response, the company announced a freeze on the project.

As societal expectations grow for the responsible use of digital technologies, firms that promote better practices will have a distinct advantage. According to a 2022 study, 58% of consumers, 60% of employees, and 64% of investors make key decisions based on their beliefs and values. Strengthening your organization’s digital responsibility can drive value creation, and brands regarded as more responsible will enjoy higher levels of stakeholder trust and loyalty. These businesses will sell more products and services, find it easier to recruit staff, and enjoy fruitful relationships with shareholders.

However, many organizations struggle to balance the legitimate but competing stakeholder interests. Key tensions arise between business objectives and responsible digital practices. For example, data localization requirements often contradict with the efficiency ambitions of globally distributed value chains. Ethical and responsible checks and balances that need to be introduced during AI/algorithm development tend to slow down development speed, which can be a problem when time-to-market is of utmost importance. Better data and analytics may enhance service personalization, but at the cost of customer privacy. Risks related to transparency and discrimination issues may dissuade organizations from using algorithms that could help drive cost reductions.

"I would like to start a vegetable garden using containers, can you give me some suggestions on ways to grow crops in pots?",6b6b77de5d3bda7c2bb1434780cf8fd1c1253192651cd63fe2d542c14bec5629,"[{'content': 'I would like to start a vegetable garden using containers, can you give me some suggestions on ways to grow crops in pots?', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': ""1. Use a Trough Planter \nA raised garden bed is a natural choice for a vegetable garden using containers. By using a trough planter, you have a raised or standing height that allows users to harvest and tends to their crops easily without needing to hunch over or kneel. As well as being a practical gardening solution, trough planters also offer a great visual benefit for adding height to your pot. \n\n2. Adding Potted Crops will Bring Productivity to any Patio \nVegetable garden container ideas will give you the chance to increase your productivity on your patio. You can make use of your unused space and add a variety of crops such as tomatoes, beans, and pumpkins. And the great thing is you don't have to spend a lot of money on landscaping or dig up half your backyard for a fancy vegetable patch. Use your patio and seating space to add more symmetrical vibrance to your outdoor space. \n\n3. Grow Potatoes in a Bag \nPotatoes are one of the easiest and simplest vegetables to grow and they are best grown in containers. If they are grown in a border, potatoes will spread into all the available soil not just in a small section where they are planted. When potatoes are planted in the ground, it can be difficult to harvest all of the crops. Placing them in a bag or container, it makes it much easier to harvest everything so that nothing is wasted. \n\n4. Be Sure to Choose the Right Container \nAlong with complementing your garden when using plant containers, you must get the right containers that are compatible with the plants you are growing. your containers should be 4 inches wider and deeper than the root ball of the plant. Shallow containers that are around 12 to 16 inches deep are great for shallow-rooted herbs and other annual vegetables. You can replenish the soil for each season when you replant them. If you are interested in growing larger plants such as aubergines or tomatoes, you would do your best by using one plant per container. \n\n5. Design Raised Garden Bed Containers to Suit Your Outdoor Space \nRaised garden beds can make great vegetable garden containers if you have a large enough space to work with. The benefit of this is that you can have these containers made to fit your landscaping, no matter how large or small they need to be. There are many great materials out there to use for raised beds. One expert suggests using Corten steel due to its durability and capacity to be bent or folded into an unusual shape. The deep rust shade of the material is also very attractive and will look great with other materials like buff-colored gravel. "", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

I need tips and suggestions on how to write a resume that will get noticed by hiring managers."", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'Here are some useful tips that will help you improve your resume so it will be noticed by hiring managers. \n\n1. Plan Ahead - When rewriting or updating your resume, you need to focus on the key sections, which are your experience, objections, special skills, and education. The more organized you are when preparing to write your resume, the more it will show in the outcome. Get started by writing an outline so that you will know what you are going to include and what you will leave out. \n\n2. Use Action Words and Bullet Points - Action verbs are incisive and can showcase to the reader what your skills are. Use words such as managed, planned, presented, supervised, coordinated, increased, or engaged to show off your accomplishments. And be sure to use plenty of bullet points to help make your content easy to scan and read. Doing so will also make it easier for you to make clear and concise statements. \n\n3. Always Be Specific - When writing about all you have accomplished, be sure to make your statements clear and specific. Something like ""Grew department revenue by 30 percent each year"" will have more power than a statement that simply says ""increased department revenue for the company"". Be sure to use specific numbers, percentages, or dollar amounts whenever possible. It will help you get your point across. \n\n4. Focus on the Positive - Always make sure you accentuate the positive thing and leave out anything negative when writing your resume. Share any special or unique accomplishments you have made, as well as any unique skills, awards, or winning work. And while it is a good idea to place your contact details at the top of the resume, you shouldn\'t add any personal details beyond that. \n\n5. Make Use of Key Words - Keywords are excellent tools to use when you want to get your resume noticed. Some companies will use scanners to seek out words that are relevant to the jobs they posted. Additionally, the keywords you use can show that you have the right amount of industry knowledge for the job you are applying for. For instance, a market research professional may mention having experience in the voice of customer work, developing actionable customer insights, or analyzing high-level data and research. \n\nBy following these useful tips, you will be able to improve your resume and gain the attention of the hiring managers you want to impress.

Give a short description of their attributes and the attire they wear. Give an example of each in a different video game.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': ""No problem, here are three class archetypes in RPGs!\n\n1. Warrior - Warriors are possibly the most used class in RPGs. It is often known as the default choice and the warrior is typically known for their strength and ability to wield a sword. The warrior normally dons armor made out of some form of metal and also wields a sword and sometimes a shield. They have a muscular build compared to other members of the party and sometimes their opponents. They are not the most clever but can certainly get the job done, most of the time with brute force. \n\nEdelgard from Fire Emblem Three Houses is a more recent example of the Warrior class.\n\n2. Mage - Mages are probably the 2nd most common class. They typically wield a stave, staff, or some wand-type object but can also sometimes wield different weapons such as a hammer or knives. Their armor is typically a cloak and their defense is oftentimes weaker than other characters. Their magic is often consumable and can run out so they will either need to rest at an inn or use an ether to restore their MP. Black mages typically use offensive magic against their opponents such as fire or lightning while white mages use healing magic like Cure and can also heal status ailments such as poison.\n\nVivi in Final Fantasy IX is one of the most iconic characters in the RPG genre.\n\n3. Thief - Thieves are most well-known for their speed as well as their ability to steal. This is typically a command that they will have from the moment they join your party. They are normally a more slender build and typically wield knives. They wear cloaks, sometimes with hoods and often prefer to hide and may also want to hide their identity. They are known much more for their support abilities than being able to attack like a Warrior, for instance. In certain games, thieves can steal very rare pieces of equipment from bosses or difficult enemies. Thieves have also been known to poison their enemies.\n\nTherion in Octopath Traveler 1 is an example of a thief. He can steal from enemies while you're in towns, which can be very helpful."", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

She points out that this slow-cooker-made recipe is higher in protein, with about 50% dry matter, and lower in fat, with about 10% dry matter than you'd find in most recipes. She adds that, since every pet has very specific needs, you should only use this recipe as a starting point, then talk things over with your pet's doctor for more specifics suited to them. \n\nThe ingredients you will need are: \n\n* 3/4ths minimum to 1 pound maximum of cubed, skinless, boneless chicken breasts or thighs. (Substitute with lean beef, turkey, or fish if necessary or preferred)\n\n* 1 ounce minimum to 3 ounces maximum of preferably chicken liver, hearts, or gizzards. Other animal livers are acceptable.\n\n* If this meal accounts for more than 10% of a dog's daily diet, include 1 tablespoon of bone meal (or 1,500 mg) per pound of meat\n\n* 1 to 2 whole eggs for a healthy source of fat \n\n* 8 ounces of brown or white rice\n\n* 16 ounces of green beans\n\n* Water\n\nTake your slow cooker and add in the diced chicken, the chicken liver, gizzards, and hearts, along with the eggs. You will then add the bone meal, rice, and green beans. Denser ingredients should be at the bottom, with the lightest ingredients on top. Since the amount of water you'll need to use depends on how long you choose to cook the ingredients and how big your slow cooker is, there isn't a specific amount you need to add. Try to fill the cooker to about two-thirds of the way full, but not less than halfway, and if possible, use a six-or-seven quart cooker. When you add in the water, you should try to submerge the ingredients without fully covering them. Then, stir the contents.\n\nPut on the lid and set the temperature to low. Leave your crockpot on for around 4 to 8 hours, only as long as needed for the chicken breasts to fall apart. As it's cooking, you can stir and add water to make the stew moister or drier, but keep in mind that you can lose up to 20 to 30 minutes of cooking time if the lid is removed.

The clouds were thick and low, spreading the same gray they always cast on the horizon where the Atlantic meets the sky. The two entities were similar, Finnegan believed: neither were as blue as the storybooks said they should be, and both seem endless. Finnegan’s boat thrust away from shore in search of amberjack fish. Finnegan’s boat was not big nor small, but it was large enough to carry his haul to the cannery and small enough to make a weaker man nervous about any storm. It would take much more than that to make Finnegan nervous, however.\n\nReaching his fishing spot, dropped lures off the starboard side and prayed the decorative barnacles would not cut his lines today. Before making it back into the cabin to escape the rain, one of his rods began dancing violently. Controlling the wild vibrations and manning the reel, Finnegan fought with whatever was attached to the hook. It was big, he knew that. Winning the battle, Finnegan saw an amberjack with the brightest yellow stripe he had ever seen on the silver-bodied fish. Wrestling the fish aboard, it stopped fighting and seemed to stare directly into Finnegan’s eyes. Then, it spoke.\n\nOver the next few months, Finnegan kept the speaking fish secret from other fishermen. Unsure why he kept it to himself, maybe it was because he had little else to call his own. His boat was financed, and his catches had to be exchanged for a small shack he rented. The fish would learn things about Finnegan he thought would never be shared. As much as Finnegan wanted to hide the fish, the fish wanted to meet more people. Therefore, it was reluctantly agreed upon that Finnegan would bring the talking fish back to the docks.\n\nReaching the docks, Finnegan gave a nervous nod to the fish and tied off the boat. Fishermen approached to see his daily catch. Everyone knew Finnegan to be a lonely man, but he was never one to talk to himself—although he was speaking. His peers realized he was communicating with a fish and, before Finnegan could react, he was restrained, and the fish was taken from him. Apparently, the fish could fetch a great prize on the market.

Why did dinosaurs go extinct?
Around 75% of Earth's animals, including dinosaurs, suddenly died out at the same point in time. So how was this global mass extinction caused by a rock hurtling into the coast of Central America?

Paul explains, 'The asteroid hit at high velocity and effectively vaporised. It made a huge crater, so in the immediate area there was total devastation. A huge blast wave and heatwave went out and it threw vast amounts of material up into the atmosphere.

'It sent soot travelling all around the world. It didn't completely block out the Sun, but it reduced the amount of light that reached the Earth's surface. So it had an impact on plant growth.'

Like dominos, this trailed up the food chain, causing the ecosystem to collapse. The reduction in plant life had a huge impact on herbivores' ability to survive, which in turn meant that carnivores would also have suffered from having less food available.

Breeding seasons would have been shorter and conditions harsher. All living things would have been affected in some way, both on land and in the ocean.

'There is a lot of discussion over the actual kill mechanism and how long that period lasted. There are still a lot of unknowns. But it was a massive event affecting all life on Earth, from microorganisms all the way through to dinosaurs,' says Paul.

"List the protections provided to plants by the Endangered Species Act in a comma-separated list. Please make your answer a complete sentence. 
This is the text to reference:

By being placed on the Endangered Species List, the twistflower is almost guaranteed to survive, since the rate at which species’ declines have been stopped after being placed on the ESL is 99%, the highest of any such national conservation program worldwide.

This protection was also doled out to the prostrate milkweed, which received 661 acres of critical habitat protection. It is illegal to cut, damage, harvest, or transport either flower under federal law.

“Protecting prostrate milkweed is a big deal for the monarch butterflies who lay their eggs on these plants as they fly through Texas after spending the winter in Mexico,” said Tierra Curry, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity.

Unlike the bracted twistflower, the milkweed is found at the moment exclusively in the terrain surrounding the banks of the Rio Grande, in Starr and Zapata counties.

Monarch populations in Mexico were counted as having increased several years in a row, vaulting the theory that it was simply a single boom year.

"Rewrite this song into a letter, to John, from Taylor. Not all of the lyrics have to be included and can be made literal, just get the point across and have it be like a breakup letter.

Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known

[Verse 2]
Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I should've known

[Bridge]
You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known

Many places in Arizona have interesting modern art, especially in the Phoenix and Scottsdale areas.  Here are some ideas for you to visit in May: \n\n1. The Phoenix Art Museum, which is not far from Scottsdale, has over 17,000 modern and contemporary works of art. The plus is, if you go with someone who likes other types of art as well, there will be something for everyone. \n2. The Eye Lounge might be perfect for you if you like eclectic places where budding contemporary artists can show off their talent. Featuring many new artists, this is a space that exhibits conceptually stimulating artworks, which inspire discussion and introspection. \n3. If you also like photography, a good option for visiting could be MonOrchid.  It's a split gallery exhibit space, which has the Bokeh Gallery and the Shade Gallery.  The Bokeh Gallery is mainly photographic artwork and digital collages. The Shade Gallery, however, is a significant space containing static and modular walls that can adapt to a variety of exhibitions. This is an ever-changing art space and is well-known by modern art enthusiasts. \n4. Perhaps you should try going to Perihelion Arts, which is a cutting-edge contemporary art gallery/artist collective that was established by Amy Young. The gallery aims to reveal the very best of contemporary art to promote public interest in the arts, with a priority on art that pushes boundaries. This includes folk, surrealism, pop surrealism, outsider, and erotic art.\n5. Another option is Oblique Art, a contemporary urban arts space and pop-up gallery located in downtown Phoenix. Obliq Art was established in 2012 intending to showcase exceptional contemporary paintings, photography and mixed media created by local Arizona artists.\n\nThese options are some of the most popular options for modern art, but there is more where that came from.  Depending on how long you'll be staying in Scottsdale, you may want to visit even more exhibits. "", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

"Rewrite this article to sound like a caveman wrote it:

People suffering from life-changing physical conditions, like losing a limb or paralysis caused by a stroke, often have a long, slow journey to regain function. But advances in digital therapies, using games and virtual reality, can make rehabilitation easier and are encouraging patients to make faster progress.

Amputees can suffer from severe phantom limb pain as well as coordination problems caused by losing an arm or leg. To address this, neurotechnology company MindMaze created a virtual reality experience that fools the patient’s brain into thinking their severed limb is still attached, helping them to manage the pain.

The company also develops games using body motion capture cameras and movement sensors to rehabilitate patients and restore movement. Thousands have received MindMaze gaming therapy in clinics around the world. And crucially, VR and games are an injection of fun into what could be an uncomfortable, difficult and tiring process.

Stroke patients struggling to recover movement, fine motor skills, and cognitive function can work their way back to fitness with the help of an animated dolphin character in ‘MindPod’. The game uses an anti-gravity vest that lifts the arm and makes it easier to control the dolphin in its undersea environment, or even do backflips out of the water.

Games like MindPod are also being used to address degenerative brain conditions such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease, and dementia. The US Department of Defence has funded a trial to see how it can prevent dementia for war veterans with traumatic brain injury.

Serious physical and neurological disorders mean that therapeutic games need to be built on solid foundations. University of California San Francisco (UCSF) video game research showed that games could be used to help older people improve their cognitive control and multitasking skills.

NeuroRacer was a simple 3D racing game developed at the university that showed how, in just hours, games training could reverse certain negative effects of aging, and might also help with disorders like ADHD and depression.

Now it seems the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the uptake of gaming therapies. Remote treatments make more sense when there is already reduced contact with doctors. In June 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration approved its first game-based therapeutic device for children with ADHD, the EndeavorRx, based on the UCSF’s groundbreaking research.

Gaming companies have been looking to develop games for the health and fitness market for more than a decade. Commercial entries, from Kinect and Xbox to Nintendo Ring Fit, show how seriously the video console and gaming industry wants to be involved.

DeepWell Digital Therapeutics has unveiled plans to build on existing games research into ADHD and depression to release its own range. While these games are unlikely to be a replacement for medication or in-person care, they can certainly help fill in gaps in care.

Boston Children’s Hospital certainly takes the digital therapy trend seriously. Clinicians worked with the Harvard Medical School to create the gaming company Mightier and road test its strategies. The result was gaming technology that showed kids how to handle stressful situations and change their behavior.


The hospital now uses gaming in family therapy and mental health sessions, showing doctors’ commitment to digital therapies. And the games industry is happy to follow suit to make gaming for wellness another option for inpatient treatment.

"Find and list the types of toilet paper for sale:

Strong and smooth
So maybe you're wondering... 

What makes this toilet paper so eco-friendly?

Great question! Did you know traditional supermarket toilet paper is made from cutting down trees? It’s one of the main causes of deforestation worldwide. That’s why we make our plastic-free rolls with only 100% recycled fibres or bamboo (a grass, not a tree).

Do they feel weird?

Not at all. We’ve made our rolls as luxe as possible – after a wipe and half, you won’t even remember what the other stuff feels like. Besides, helping reduce deforestation feels pretty great, if you ask us.

Ok, but I'm scared of subscriptions.

We’ve all been burned before. But we promise (like double dog pinky promise) we’re incredibly flexible and make it easy for you to cancel at any time. Almost too easy - it’s kind of bad for business.

"I've been hired to develop a line of eco-friendly packing materials. I need potential ideas for sustainable, eco-friendly packaging materials. Can you provide a detailed list of ideas?

I need potential ideas for sustainable, eco-friendly packaging materials. Can you provide a detailed list of ideas? "", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'Sure! Here are some ideas for eco-friendly, sustainable packaging material: \n\n1. Edible Packaging:  Develop packaging material made from edible substances, such as seaweed, starch, or fruit peels. This would eliminate waste and provide an eco-friendly alternative to traditional packaging. This idea aligns to reduce waste and offers an innovative solution where packaging can be consumed along with the product, minimizing the effects on the environment.\n\n2. Biodegradable Packaging: Create packaging materials that can easily decompose in natural environments, reducing environmental impact and waste accumulation.  Biodegradable materials break down naturally, reducing waste accumulation in landfills and oceans, while promoting a circular economy. \n\n3. Plant-based Plastics: Explore the use of bioplastics derived from renewable resources like corn, sugarcane, or algae. These materials have a lower carbon footprint and can be recycled or composted. Using renewable resources for plastic production decreases reliance on fossil fuels and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. \n\n4. Mushroom Packaging: Investigate the use of mycelium, the vegetative part of mushrooms, as a sustainable packaging material. It is biodegradable, requires fewer resources to produce, and can be molded into various shapes. Mushroom packaging is a biodegradable and sustainable alternative to traditional packaging materials, utilizing agricultural waste as a resource.\n\n5. Minimalist Packaging: Design packaging that minimizes the use of materials and focuses on the essential aspects of product protection. This approach reduces waste and promotes a more sustainable supply chain. By focusing on essential packaging elements, waste is minimized. \n\n6. Reusable Packaging: Develop a system that encourages consumers to return packaging for reuse, similar to how glass milk bottles were collected and refilled in the past. This approach reduces waste and engages consumers in the sustainability process. This option promotes a circular economy and reduces the overall demand for new packaging materials.\n\n7. Smart Packaging: Explore the integration of sensors or indicators on the packaging that can monitor food freshness, temperature, or quality. This would help reduce waste by providing accurate information to consumers. Providing real-time information about quality and freshness helps prevent food waste by enabling informed decisions.  \n\n8. Upcycled Packaging: Investigate the use of upcycled materials, such as recycled paper or discarded textiles, to create unique and eco-friendly packaging solutions. Using discarded materials for packaging reduces waste and repurposes resources that would otherwise be sent to landfills.', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

The mere hint of a change to it sends the best of the best of them into a tailspin. It's a machine-learning, traffic-eating, complex set of codes that knows how to solve problems. On its own. And Zuc has invested a lot of cash into making sure it does a good job.\n\nNaturally, it's pretty smart, too. Way smarter than us. And over the past few years, it's gotten smarter. So smart that it has reduced the effort needed to manage and optimize ads, targeting, bids, and budgets. Can it find you the best audience for targeting your ads? Yes, it can. It just needs data from you.\n\nFeed the Machine.\nBy far, the easiest and best way to find the perfect audience is to give Facebook your customers and let them figure it out for you. Who better to start with than your existing customers, right? The most effective customer data to feed Facebook is your website traffic generated from Facebook. As you know, you'll need the Facebook Pixel installed on your site to capture this. From there you can create Custom Audiences and use those audiences to create Lookalike Audiences that best mirror your existing customers to find new customers. \n\nYou can also upload your CRM data (emails, phone numbers, etc.) and Facebook will create a custom audience off of that. You can also build a custom audience off of your Facebook page. You can also make a custom audience off your engagement. You can also segment a custom audience by triggered events to better move your customers through your funnel. You can also use a custom audience to retarget. You can also... get the point? There are a lot of options here. And all of them can be used to make lookalike audiences which will broaden your reach.\n\nCustom and lookalike audiences are Zuc's gift to you to make your Facebook ad life easier. They are a potent tool that can help you to specify, segment, and develop the perfect audience that will yield the best results."", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Generation

One day, an older, mysterious woman stayed behind. She saw beyond the forced smiling faces and saw how all the animals cowered in fear when he was around or when they heard his booming voice. She knew there was something wrong with this circus, and she aimed to find out what it was. \n\nAs she quietly snuck around the tents, she heard the ringleader screaming at his employees. Her suspicions were founded, and she continued to watch and listen. When she saw him kick a skinny, starved dog chained outside his tent, she knew she had to take action. She wasn't going to report him to authorities, though; she had another plan. She knew dark magic. The way to teach this horrible man a lesson is to turn him into what he despises the most. The old woman waited until he went to bed, then she started her chant. She watched as a dark mist entered his tent. It glowed briefly to let her know the magic was successful. \n\nWhen the ringleader woke up the next morning, he found he was chained to a post outside. He was cold, tired, and hungry, and when he tried to speak, there were no words. Only barks, whines, and whimpers exited his throat. The ringleader had been turned into a dog and now would live the rest of his life as a poor, mistreated animal. "", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Generation
"What are some ways I can eliminate trash being littered in my community? I don't want to tackle this issue alone so the proposed ideas shouldn't be solo solutions I have to do by myself. FYI, I live in a condo community, within a suburban metropolitan region.",b54a5e8fae12129c01aba577a8137e5e617ada969bbd8e450c55e135278a0e22,"[{'content': ""What are some ways I can eliminate trash being littered in my community? I don't want to tackle this issue alone so the proposed ideas shouldn't be solo solutions I have to do by myself. FYI, I live in a condo community, within a suburban metropolitan region."", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'Trash littered within a community is unpleasant and can be hard to prevent if the culprits are unknown. Here are some ways to prevent trash from being littered in your community.\n\n1) Engage the HOA\nHOA groups often create and enforce policies for the residential communities they manage. Most likely, you are not the only resident observing the trash being littered around your neighborhood and there is a high chance that other neighbors share the discontent. If your townhouse community has an HOA, bringing this issue to their attention at the next HOA meeting may be a good way to start. With enough support from other residents and approval from the HOA board, guidelines can be set restricting any trash to be littered. HOA often also have the power, written into the contractual agreements signed by residents before move-in, to enforce rules they set. Penalties for residents refusing to comply with rules may range from thousands of dollars in fees to eviction. If new HOA rules making improper disposal of trash can be set, then residents will have to eventually comply, assuming the root cause is from within the community. HOAs may even help lead preventative strategies attempting to proactively address the problem. Some strategies include the installation of waste baskets for general use, increasing the frequency of waste management services, installing street signs, and/or employing third-party street cleaning services. \n\n2) Establish a Neighborhood Watch Group\nA neighborhood watch, also called a crime watch is an organized group of civilians devoted to crime and vandalism prevention within a neighborhood, including littering. Similar to HOA organizations, members of watch groups are often intrinsically motivated to maintain a clean neighborhood and share the same common goals. Neighborhood watch groups can be as informal or formal as one would like, although informal methods may be easier to start if your community does not have such a group in place already. Typically, informal watch groups involve select community residents patrolling and monitoring the community looking out for any suspicious activity, crime, or other behavior breaking rules. A schedule is usually shared between volunteers listing out availabilities, procedures in case of emergencies, and contact information, including local law enforcement. Having an active neighborhood watch group monitoring the community will likely deter the culprits. Although the initial purpose of starting a watch group may be to catch and deter litterers, it is possible that the group also inadvertently encounters more serious and dangerous criminals who have gone unnoticed in the past. Depending on the danger of the threats, and if the watch group volunteers are inexperienced or untrained in handling more threatening situations, then risks can quickly escalate beyond what was anticipated. Therefore, the safety of the volunteers within the group is an important concern and should remain a high priority. \n\n3) Contact local law enforcement\nLaw enforcement will likely be able to assist in preventing trash to be littered in your community. Law enforcement is a public service and it can be argued that trash is impeding the well-being of the local public. A big advantage of involving law enforcement over creating a local neighborhood watch group is that the former has extensive experience and training in dealing with a wide range of threats, while the latter may not. For example, if the litterers also coincidentally happen to be wanted fugitives then law enforcement would be prepared to apprehend the criminals safely away from the community residents. Another advantage of involving law enforcement to eliminate trash being littered in your community is that they can adjust their levels of engagement depending on the severity of the issues. If the trash being littered is largely immaterial or non-threatening, then they may elect to install street signs warning culprits of the consequences of littering or occasionally patrol the street in marked police cars. Law enforcement may even leave a marked police car in plain sight within the community since the sight of a police car is known to reduce the chances of criminal activity in most cases. However, if trash being littered is significantly harming the residents (e.g., hazardous materials, food waste, heavy items, etc.), then law enforcement will likely elect to increase their engagement and may even dedicate an officer present at all times. As illustrated, some of the benefits of contacting law enforcement are the flexibility of engagement, the depth of their expertise, and nearly unlimited resources in combatting the littering issue.', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm
"Rewrite this news article in the form of a prose-based short story from the 3rd person point of view of Dennis. You'll have to take some creative liberties in Dennis's inner thoughts but make sure they feel authentic based on the article. Include the term ""American Dream"" somewhere. 

Dennis C. would rather retire than return to the office full time — and that's exactly what he did.

The Alabama-based 65-year-old, who verified his last name, former employment, and salary range with Insider, but asked that they be withheld to protect his privacy, got a taste of working from home years ago. In 2018, higher-ups at his job handed a day of remote work out as a reward. By 2019, he was working two days remotely, and three days in the office. He said that schedule was ""fantastic,"" and he thought he'd never retire: ""This is perfect, this is heaven.""

But as 2020 rolled in and sent everyone home, he discovered he loved full-time remote work even more. 

""We went to five days a week and it was like, 'Oh, I thought two was good, five is the sweet spot,'"" Dennis said. ""There's no reason to go back to the office.""

He loved remote work for the same reasons he thinks other people do: more time to concentrate, and fewer meetings. He could turn off his camera, mute, and still plug away. His commute went from 20 minutes to five minutes. 

""If I wanted to do something and it wasn't time constrained, I could stop work and pick it up later that evening,"" he said.

He's not alone in that: Some remote workers are living like college kids again, using their afternoons for leisure activities or errands, and then picking work back up later in the day.

""The more choice we have, the more autonomy we have, I think, the happier we are,"" Dennis said.

But then, in April 2021, Dennis was called back to the office. The company wanted him to come in for three days a week. Dennis, who was technically eligible to retire and had already been looking for new roles, said it was the straw that broke the camel's back.

""When they said that I was going to have to come back, I sent them an email saying I'm retiring,"" he said.  

Dennis had already secured a job offer elsewhere as a defense contractor. With the new role, he'd be taking a slight pay cut, bringing his salary from six figures to a little less. But since he receives new monthly retirement benefits from his old federal job, he's still technically bringing in more than he was before.

His new role is also fully remote, a must-have for him. He said that it's been, in a word, ""fantastic."" 

Bosses are made obsolete by remote work
Dennis isn't alone. Felicia, an administrator in Arizona, previously told Insider that she too was leaving behind a six-figure salary over a forced return to the office. Her bosses were suffering from productivity paranoia and could not believe that people working from home were actually working.

Dennis said that he thinks the only people who fully fail at remote work are those who went to meetings in person, walked around with a piece of paper, and looked busy — but weren't actually getting much done. But self-starters and motivated people with goals can excel with remote work.

But remote work also calls into question the purpose of a boss, he said. A boss's model, whether they voice it aloud, is to make sure their employees get work done. And so those employees have to be there, in front of them, so the bosses can ensure they're working.

""It's almost, 'If I don't see you working, then I don't have anything to do. What's my purpose?'"" Dennis said. ""So, I think that's the main driver of bringing people back.""

With the pandemic, the remote-work genie is out of the bag, Dennis said. At his old job, higher-ups once doled out remote work as a reward. Now, there's a ""bunch of people"" who know they don't need to be in the office to do productive work.

And that's going to lead to a reckoning for bosses. 

""The managers, especially the mid-level managers, still are going to want to see people. That's kind of justification for their job,"" he said. ""If everybody can work remote, it's a new model for the manager.""

Even as remote work has fallen off slightly in the near term — the Bureau of Labor Statistics recently found that nearly 73% surveyed of companies offered little to no telework in September, compared to 60% surveyed in 2021 — Dennis still thinks it will slowly take over, especially as office leases expire.

""I'm a baby boomer, so we're starting to die out,"" he said. He added that as baby boomers ""leave the scene, so to speak,"" so will some of their traditions.

""I think a lot of people that have exposure to remote work will say, 'Hey, that worked,'"" Dennis said.",62b847e122c2548e4758b6bbce1e208bd0432193275dd88d277034b12ba58f9d,"[{'content': 'Rewrite this news article in the form of a prose-based short story from the 3rd person point of view of Dennis.

Forty years in the workforce had come and gone as he worked his way up the corporate ladder, and things never really changed. Not until 2018, when his Alabama employer began to offer a brand new benefit: As a reward for good work, employees would be offered one day of remote work. Though the concept was foreign, it intrigued Dennis, and he worked towards gaining as many remote days as possible. \n\nAs his first day of work at home passed, he felt like this was something he could get used to. The convenience was unmatched -- who wouldn't prefer a five-minute commute to the home office over twenty minutes in traffic? \n\nDennis continued to strive towards earning more of this reward and by the next year, his work week consisted of two days at home and three days in the office. Settled into the new routine, he felt he could do this forever. If he could always experience this much flexibility, maybe he didn't even have to retire... \n\nThe split allowed him the flexibility to run errands before the stores closed while picking his work up again at a time that felt more convenient. Things couldn't possibly be better. \n\nThen, in 2020, his work became fully remote. Five days of work at home seemed too good to be true; it improved his concentration and productivity, and there were far fewer meetings. For the first time since joining the workforce, Dennis had autonomy over his schedule. Working remotely for two days was fantastic, but he quickly realized that five days was the sweet spot. There was no reason to return to the office now. \n\nWhen talking with other people, Dennis seemed to notice a pattern. All of his coworkers that failed at remote work were the types of people that would attend meetings with paper and pen, pretending to look busy the entire time. But anyone who was a self-starter, who could find their own motivation, seemed to be thriving. \n\nStill, there was one more group of people he had yet to consider: The bosses. What was a boss's purpose, anyway? Did they actually do anything but micromanage their underlings? He couldn't help wondering what all of the bosses and higher-ups were doing during their remote working time, since there was nobody for them to watch or manage. If they don't see people working... what's their purpose?\n\nSure enough, another year came and went, and Dennis learned the answer. The managers and bosses needed employees back in person so desperately that they drove everybody back to the office. Well, everybody who didn't quit. \n\nAfter he had a taste of full-time remote work, Dennis knew he could never go back. When he got his call to return to his 2019 schedule of two days home and three days in-office, that was the final straw. The camel's back broke. He knew it was time to move on. \n\nSending an email back to the company, Dennis announced his retirement and decided to accept another job offer. Even though this new offer had a smaller salary than his previous position, it didn't matter. A fully remote position made up for that. Not to mention, his old employer would be paying out his monthly retirement benefits now, bringing his income to a higher level than before. \n\nThis was the new American Dream.

"Turn these paragraphs into a casual email meant for a friend named Bowen curious about the Legend of Faust.

Faust or Faustus is a scholar who sells his soul to the Devil. Although fictional in literature, the legend is based on an astrologer and alchemist who lived in the area of northern Germany in the fifteenth century.

Trained in theology, he turns to magic and makes a perilous deal with the Devil in which he commits his soul to eternal damnation in return for power and knowledge in this life. But he is only human, and arrogant and reckless. Can Faust — or anyone — wield the powers of God or resist the temptations of the Devil?

The legend has inspired many great writers, musicians, and other artists. The earliest known published sources for the legend are the Wolfenbüttler manuscript dated about 1580-1587, and a printed chapbook (the Spies edition), intended for popular sale dated 1587. Two famous literary works on the Faust theme are Christopher Marlowe’s The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus, and Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe’s Faust.

While Goethe’s Faust has been called the definitive Faust, there is no one Faust story, instead, there are hundreds or thousands of variations on the theme in theatre, music, film, poetry, art, and literature including classics and favorites: The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, The Picture of Dorian Grey, The Phantom of the Opera/Paradise, The Devil and Daniel Webster, Damn Yankees, The Little Shop of Horrors and many more.

"Explain this same concept, but do so in a way that a 5th grader can understand.

Melissa Murray: Let’s start with the elephant in the room: the mifepristone rulings. A judge in the Amarillo division of the northern district of Texas has issued a decision that stays the FDA’s approval of mifepristone. Another competing ruling in the western district of Washington requires the FDA to continue making mifepristone available to those in a number of blue states which have filed a challenge of their own to maintain mifepristone access. We have governors in states like California and Massachusetts stockpiling both mifepristone and misoprostol. Is it chaotic by design?

Jessica Valenti: Yes. The point is to sow so much uncertainty that even in places where abortion is legal, people don’t know if they can get the care they are legally entitled to. Doctors will be afraid. Pharmacists will be afraid. And because this is all changing so quickly, that feeds into that chaos too.

Melissa Murray: In June 2022, the Supreme Court issued its much-anticipated decision in Dobbs, which upheld by a 6-3 vote a Mississippi law that banned abortion at just 15 weeks—and by a 5-4 vote, overruled both Casey and Roe. The Court insisted that its decision did no more than return the fraught and vexed question of abortion to the democratic process and to the people, who were rightfully the ones to decide this question. So, is Judge Kacsmaryk “the people”?

Jessica Valenti: We always knew that it was never about state’s rights. It was always about banning abortion in every single state in every possible way.

What has been really frustrating to me in Kacsmaryk’s ruling is this idea that they’re doing something for women’s health, that they’re protecting us. It just adds salt to the wound. It makes me a little more furious than usual because it’s so offensive, so insulting and so obviously false.

Melissa Murray: What Jessica is referring to is the plaintiff, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, arguing that mifepristone is unsafe for women despite the FDA’s approval that has been in place for over 20 years. What is this about? Is this a backlash to women’s progress? Is this an effort to put us back into a particular box? I mean the women’s rights movement has been in place since the 1970s. Ruth Bader Ginsburg helped to read women into the Equal Protection Clause. Abortion rights is only part of that. Again, this is the question this symposium asks: Is there more to come, and how will we as women fit into a society that purports to be democratic without necessarily taking into account the voices of women?

Jessica Valenti: I think so much of this is about punishment. I don’t think it is a coincidence that they went after abortion medication specifically. Abortion medication completely changed the way that people were able to get abortion care. You can have an abortion in your home while watching Netflix privately. We took away their ability to publicly shame us at clinics, and that made them angry. They don’t want abortion to be easy and safe and that is part of the big hypocrisy.

Melissa Murray: Punishing women but for what? What are we doing?

Jessica Valenti: Existing. Having our own lives and making our own decisions. And I think with abortion specifically that is very much you controlling your body, the trajectory of your life and of your family.",296608e44a27e9e76a83b0bf390bfeac4cde60d7cf6d0854e7c5995fcb96c2fc,"[{'content': 'Explain this same concept, but do so in a way that a 5th grader can understand.\n\nMelissa Murray: Let’s start with the elephant in the room: the mifepristone rulings.

I don’t think it is a coincidence that they went after abortion medication specifically. Abortion medication completely changed the way that people were able to get abortion care. You can have an abortion in your home while watching Netflix privately. We took away their ability to publicly shame us at clinics, and that made them angry. They don’t want abortion to be easy and safe and that is part of the big hypocrisy.\n\nMelissa Murray: Punishing women but for what? What are we doing?\n\nJessica Valenti: Existing. Having our own lives and making our own decisions. And I think with abortion specifically that is very much you controlling your body, the trajectory of your life and of your family.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': ""Melissa Murray and Jessica Valenti are talking about some recent decisions and changes regarding a medicine called mifepristone and the availability of abortion. They mention different rulings from judges in different parts of the country, which are causing confusion and uncertainty about whether people can get the care they need. This is making doctors and pharmacists worried too.\n\nThey also mention a decision by the Supreme Court in 2022 that allowed a law in Mississippi to ban abortion after just 15 weeks and overruled previous decisions protecting abortion rights. The Court said it was giving the power back to the people to decide. However, Jessica believes that the real goal has always been to ban abortion in every state.\n\nThey discuss a group called the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine that argues mifepristone is unsafe for women, even though it has been approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for a long time. They question if this is a backlash against women's progress and an attempt to control and limit our choices.\n\nJessica believes that a big part of this is about punishing women for simply existing and making their own decisions. Abortion medication has made it easier and more private for women to have abortions, and some people don't want that. They want to make it difficult and unsafe, which is unfair and hypocritical.\n\nOverall, they raise important questions about how women's voices and rights are being considered in our society, and how we can navigate a democratic society that may not always prioritize women's perspectives."", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Rewrite

"Reframe this discussion about the perceived effectiveness of supplements, with a particular focus on Vitamin D, into a conversation between two health-conscious friends debating about the validity of supplements in their daily routines.

These are dark days for supplements. Although they are a $30-plus billion market in the United States alone, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, beta-carotene, glucosamine, chondroitin, and fish oil have now flopped in study after study.

If there was one supplement that seemed sure to survive the rigorous tests, it was vitamin D. People with low levels of vitamin D in their blood have significantly higher rates of virtually every disease and disorder you can think of: cancer, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, heart attack, stroke, depression, cognitive impairment, autoimmune conditions, and more. The vitamin is required for calcium absorption and is thus essential for bone health, but as evidence mounted that lower levels of vitamin D were associated with so many diseases, health experts began suspecting that it was involved in many other biological processes as well.

And they believed that most of us weren’t getting enough of it. This made sense. Vitamin D is a hormone manufactured by the skin with the help of sunlight. It’s difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities through diet. When our ancestors lived outdoors in tropical regions and ran around half naked, this wasn’t a problem. We produced all the vitamin D we needed from the sun.

But today most of us have indoor jobs, and when we do go outside, we’ve been taught to protect ourselves from dangerous UV rays, which can cause skin cancer. Sunscreen also blocks our skin from making vitamin D, but that’s OK, says the American Academy of Dermatology, which takes a zero-tolerance stance on sun exposure: “You need to protect your skin from the sun every day, even when it’s cloudy,” it advises on its website. Better to slather on sunblock, we’ve all been told, and compensate with vitamin D pills.

Yet vitamin D supplementation has failed spectacularly in clinical trials. Five years ago, researchers were already warning that it showed zero benefit, and the evidence has only grown stronger. In November, one of the largest and most rigorous trials of the vitamin ever conducted—in which 25,871 participants received high doses for five years—found no impact on cancer, heart disease, or stroke.",b902a4ca46da80b652b50f83a3f8bfeadb7de8ed05878d2bb08c25fa8fea6538,"[{'content': 'Reframe this discussion about the perceived effectiveness of supplements, with a particular focus on Vitamin D, into a conversation between two health-conscious friends debating about the validity of supplements in their daily routines.\n\nThese are dark days for supplements.

With Their Knowledge Combined, Two Scholars Are Deciphering a Long-Lost Native Language

When historian Alejandra Dubcovsky was in graduate school in the early 2000s, she decided to focus her research on the Indigenous cultures of the Americas. “I asked my professors, ‘Should I learn any Native languages?’” Dubcovsky recalled. “And they were like, ‘Why? You know Spanish, you know French—you’re set for life.’” Dubcovsky laughed. “And I went to Berkeley!”

Dubcovsky’s teachers were just repeating what their own mentors had told them: Native languages were too hard to learn, and most pre-Columbian cultures didn’t leave behind written records anyway. Some, like the Aztec and Maya, had hieroglyphic systems, but those symbols offered little insight into the spoken languages themselves. Why shouldn’t Dubcovsky, who was born in Argentina, just study the records of Spanish colonizers the way generations before her had done?

When she connected with Aaron Broadwell, a linguistics professor at the University of Florida, she found the missing puzzle pieces she had been seeking. Broadwell was an expert on the Native languages of the American Southeast—Choctaw, Creek and others that belonged to the Muskogee family. His most ambitious project was decoding a language, spoken by the Timucua people, that is unrelated to any other known tongue.

When Spanish colonizers arrived in the 16th century, Timucua was the most widely spoken language in large swaths of Florida and Georgia. Within two centuries, by the time of U.S. independence, its speakers had all been enslaved, felled by disease or absorbed into other language groups. Despite its diminishment, Timucua left a record—it was the first Native language within modern U.S. borders to be put into writing, albeit using the Roman alphabet. Rare book libraries hold Franciscan texts that display Spanish on one side and Timucua on the other. Most historians just read the Spanish side. But Dubcovsky wanted to know what the Timucua texts really said.

Since around 2000, Broadwell has been assembling the first comprehensive online Timucua dictionary, with the help of graduate students and computer programs that can search for patterns in grammar and meaning. Together, he and Dubcovsky have also made a number of startling new discoveries that challenge the usual narrative about how the Timucua language came to be written down.

Those of us at Smithsonian repeated a version of that narrative in our March issue, briefly crediting the Franciscan missionary Francisco Pareja with transcribing the Timucua language into the Roman alphabet. That version of the story, with Pareja at the center, has been widely promulgated for generations. As a catalogue entry at the Library of Congress puts it: “Timucuan is a dead language. Spoken by an Indigenous tribe that lived in northeast-north central Florida during the time of Spanish colonization, it was learned and recorded by Friar Francisco Pareja, a missionary and self-taught linguist. Thanks to his efforts, Timucua is now considered the best-attested language from a Native tribe in Spanish Colonial Florida.”",6183379ca8a7d38aad2f80300526bb5afa851fa728afba18151308fe1c2841a3,"[{'content': 'Rewrite this in a format a fourth grader would understand.\n\nWith Their Knowledge Combined, Two Scholars Are Deciphering a Long-Lost Native Language\n\nWhen historian Alejandra Dubcovsky was in graduate school in the early 2000s, she decided to focus her research on the Indigenous cultures of the Americas. “I asked my professors, ‘Should I learn any Native languages?’” Dubcovsky recalled. “And they were like, ‘Why?

They may think I'm mad, but I will give you the greatest coconut bundt cake recipe ever created!\n\nFirst, make sure that you have a bundt pan. This recipe is perfectly calculated for a 6-cup pan to make two cakes, but you can use one 12-cup pan to make one larger cake as long as you increase the overall cook time to an hour.\n\nHere are the ingenious ingredients that will make a cake so good the world will think you're an evil genius like me:\n\n1. Cake Ingredients\n    a. 2 teaspoons of coconut extract. This is the most important one!\n    b. 1 teaspoon of baking powder\n    c. 4 eggs\n    d. 2 1/4 cups of flour\n    e. 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract\n    f. 1/2 a cup of milk\n    g. 1 cup of sweetened shredded coconut\n    h. 2 1/2 cups of sugar\n    i. 1/2 a teaspoon of salt\n    j. 1 cup of butter (softened)\n2. Glaze ingredients\n   a. 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar\n   b. 1 teaspoon of coconut extract\n   c. 2 tablespoons of milk\n   d. 2 tablespoons of melted butter\n3. Topping ingredients\n   a. 2/3 a cup of shredded sweetened coconut\n\nNow that you have gathered the ingredients for your cooking experiment, it is time to begin bringing your creation to life! Mua ha ha ha ha!\n\n- Preheat your oven to 325 degrees F. Grease and lightly flour your bundt pans and set up your oven rack in the middle of the oven. Setting up all of this in advance separates normal scientists from true mad scientists!\n- Whisk your flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium mixing bowl and set it aside.\n- In a bigger mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until they are fluffy and light. Add the eggs and two types of extract and continue to beat this new mixture until it is smooth. Add the milk and beat again on low speed. Then add the flour mix from the other bowl and beat it until the two have become one. Stir in your coconut.\n- Pour this batter into your bundt pans and put them in the oven for fifty to fifty-five minutes. You should have plenty of time to plot your next experiment while you're waiting!\n- When your cake is finished, set the pan on a wire rack to cool for fifteen minutes. After this, place the cooling rack over the top of the pan and flip the whole thing over. The cake should drop out with no problem if you have followed my brilliant instructions correctly!\n- Now, the time of the glaze has arrived. Melt the butter in a glass bowl, then add the rest of the three ingredients and whisk it all together until it is smooth. Add more milk to thin it or more powdered sugar to thicken it.\n- Drizzle the glaze and sprinkle the coconut over the cake, and your experiment is finally alive!

"Rewrite this as if it's a speech being given by someone in a board meeting, looking for the team to get results.

It has been a little over a year since Batwoman was cancelled by The CW, bringing the fan-favorite superhero series to a close after three seasons. The second and third seasons of the show were led by Javicia Leslie, who brought the new character of Ryan Wilder / Batwoman to life, and charmed many fans in the process. In the time since Batwoman's cancellation, Leslie has gotten to reprise her role (with a twist) on the ninth and final season of The Flash, but it sounds like there's even more that she would love to tackle with regards to the character. While speaking to ComicBook.com about her role in the upcoming film Double Life, Leslie touched on what she would want to tackle if she got the opportunity to portray Ryan again.

""Definitely more stunts,"" Leslie explained. ""I think that Ryan's fighting sequences are really great, because she's not a superhero, so it's not really... I mean, she's a superhero. She doesn't have magic powers, so it's not like she's like, 'Da da da da.' It's fight scenes, and I love that. I love the fight sequences. I would just [want] more Gotham.

David being a curious kid, decided he was grown enough to \'challenge the almighty jungle\' not knowing what awaited him.\n\nAfter school on an odd Thursday afternoon, he ventured into the forest without telling his parents. As he entered, the atmosphere almost changed from thick fog to a more visible and bright environment. He suddenly heard loud voices, which sounded like they came from a human. He decided to check the sound out, thinking it was another group of kids who were also curious. He walked through the forest, being cautious and amazed by the scenery. \n\nAll of a sudden, he saw what looked like a monkey sleeping on the ground. Being curious, he decided to try to poke it with a stick. ""What are you doing,"" screamed the monkey. David had never seen a monkey before, especially not a talking monkey.

"Summarize for me in a few sentences what the release process for Toki will be like. 

Tokitae, or Toki, the oldest killer whale in captivity, will finally be released to her ""home waters"" in Puget Sound, off Washington State. The 57-year-old orca, nicknamed Lolita, was captured when she was four and sold to the Miami Seaquarium in Florida. She entertained park visitors for over five decades before retiring in 2022.

The 5,000-pound (2,267-kg), 20-foot-long (6 meters) orca has spent most of her life in a tiny tank. It measures 80 feet by 35 feet (24 meters by 11 meters) and 20 feet (6 meters) deep!
The news of the killer whale's release was announced on March 30, 2023. Toki will be reintroduced to the wild gradually. She will begin her new life in a netted 15-acre (6-hectare) whale sanctuary built in the waters around the San Juan Islands. The killer whale will initially be restricted to a smaller enclosure within that sanctuary and monitored closely.

If all goes well, the orca will eventually be reunited with her family. Toki is believed to be the daughter of the 89-year-old leader of the L-pod. This is one of three groups that make up the Southern Resident killer whales. The endangered orcas live in the Salish Sea between Washington State and British Columbia. As of July 2021, only 73 Southern Residents remain.

Though hailed as a victory by animal activists, Toki's former caregivers are not thrilled about the killer whale's release. They believe the animal is in poor health and the stress of the move, which could take multiple days, might kill her. She could also be susceptible to pollutants in the ocean waters.

Instead, they suggest keeping her in Florida. One option is to move her to SeaWorld Orlando. The marine zoological park has one of the largest killer whale habitats in the world. They also have the expertise to provide the care Toki needs. Additionally, the move would take only a few hours.

On April 1, 1970, President Richard Nixon signs legislation officially banning cigarette ads on television and radio. Nixon, who was an avid pipe smoker, indulging in as many as eight bowls a day, supported the legislation at the increasing insistence of public health advocates.
Alarming health studies emerged as early as 1939 that linked cigarette smoking to higher incidences of cancer and heart disease and, by the end of the 1950s, all states had laws prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to minors. In 1964, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) agreed that advertisers had a responsibility to warn the public of the health hazards of cigarette smoking. In 1969, after the surgeon general of the United States released an official report linking cigarette smoking to low birth weight, Congress yielded to pressure from the public health sector and signed the Cigarette Smoking Act. This act required cigarette manufacturers to place warning labels on their products that stated “Cigarette Smoking May be Hazardous to Your Health.”
By the early 1970s, the fight between the tobacco lobby and public health interests forced Congress to draft legislation to regulate the tobacco industry and special committees were convened to hear arguments from both sides. Public health officials and consumers wanted stronger warning labels on tobacco products and their advertisements banned from television and radio, where they could easily reach impressionable children. (Tobacco companies were the single largest product advertisers on television in 1969.) Cigarette makers defended their industry with attempts to negate the growing evidence that nicotine was addictive and that cigarette smoking caused cancer. Though they continued to bombard unregulated print media with ads for cigarettes, tobacco companies lost the regulatory battle over television and radio. The last televised cigarette ad ran at 11:50 p.m. during The Johnny Carson Show on January 1, 1971.
Tobacco has played a part in the lives of presidents since the country’s inception. A hugely profitable crop in early America, Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Madison and Jackson owned tobacco plantations and used tobacco in the form of snuff or smoked cigars. Regulation of the tobacco industry in the form of excise taxes began during Washington’s presidency and continues to this day. In 1962, John F. Kennedy became the first president to sponsor studies on smoking and public health.
Tobacco has not been the only thing smoked at the White House. In 1978, after country-music entertainer Willie Nelson performed for President Carter there, he is said to have snuck up to the roof and surreptitiously smoked what he called a big fat Austin torpedo, commonly known as marijuana.",8919c05a61f09bc53d01c574a15fbedd55cb52b1c19fcbff8b83c27813c43e64,"[{'content': ""Summarize this article by removing irrelevant information so that you only explain why cigarette ads allowed aren't on television and radio.\n\nOn April 1, 1970, President Richard Nixon signs legislation officially banning cigarette ads on television and radio.

"Use this to answer my question. What is the rating of the borrowers that advertised rates are generally for?

Nobel Prize recipient, Richard Thaler, in his research into seemingly irrational economic behaviors, ""found that consumers generally search too little, get confused while evaluating complex alternatives, and are slow to switch from past choices, even if it costs them."" ""Why are consumers leaving money on the table?""

Based on this behavior, a borrower securing a mortgage might depend on their existing banking relationship or a single referral from a friend or agent rather than shopping multiple lenders.

When shopping for a lower mortgage rate, consider that not all lenders share the same business practices. Some may lure unsuspecting borrowers to a rate, knowing full well that they cannot deliver on it. After making a loan application and supplying information necessary for approval, they reveal that the rate is not available for ""whatever"" reason.

They’re counting on the borrower wanting to get into the home because the closing date is near and they’ll compromise by accepting the higher than quoted rate.

Shopping for a mortgage rate can result in savings because rates are set by individual lenders. To get an apples-to-apples comparison, the terms of the mortgage being shopped should be consistent among the lender candidates.

a tiger got the coronavirus in the bronx
Tiger land we got the virus
You thought animals couldn’t get it
But a tiger got it and
He was from the Bronx zoo in New York
He got it from a zookeeper
Really that it is bad
That this tiger got the virus
We should watch out for his class
That this tiger could do more than
Bite if you annoy
To every girl and boy
He could give the virus to everybody around
And the tiger doesn’t have the knowledge to wash his hands
Like the humans do
But this tiger can spread the virus
To everybody here
If they touch body, nose and ear
Tigers can spread this virus
So how are we going to
Keep this tiger in isolation
He won’t perform on social media
Cause he is a cute tiger
And god knows if a tiger could get it
He could escape and do more than
Bite our *** to death
He could spread the virus for our deaths
I rhymed death with deaths
Who cares because a tiger has the virus
And hopefully they can keep this tiger
Safe and in quarantined forever and ever
Orange and black
Keep this tiger safe

"Rewrite this as if it's from a middle school student with a soccer game and a test tomorrow, who's talking to his friend about all the cool things he's learning about photosynthesis.

General characteristics
Development of the idea
The study of photosynthesis began in 1771 with observations made by the English clergyman and scientist Joseph Priestley. Priestley had burned a candle in a closed container until the air within the container could no longer support combustion. He then placed a sprig of mint plant in the container and discovered that after several days the mint had produced some substance (later recognized as oxygen) that enabled the confined air to again support combustion. In 1779 the Dutch physician Jan Ingenhousz expanded upon Priestley’s work, showing that the plant had to be exposed to light if the combustible substance (i.e., oxygen) was to be restored. He also demonstrated that this process required the presence of the green tissues of the plant.


In 1782 it was demonstrated that the combustion-supporting gas (oxygen) was formed at the expense of another gas, or “fixed air,” which had been identified the year before as carbon dioxide. Gas-exchange experiments in 1804 showed that the gain in weight of a plant grown in a carefully weighed pot resulted from the uptake of carbon, which came entirely from absorbed carbon dioxide, and water taken up by plant roots; the balance is oxygen, released back to the atmosphere. Almost half a century passed before the concept of chemical energy had developed sufficiently to permit the discovery (in 1845) that light energy from the sun is stored as chemical energy in products formed during photosynthesis.",dd1442b99828298f5f1510b6e240bbfb00ce7f302d2ff9d56b8df7d3add28d7f,"[{'content': ""Rewrite this as if it's from a middle school student with a soccer game and a test tomorrow, who's talking to his friend about all the cool things he's learning about photosynthesis.\n\nGeneral characteristics\nDevelopment of the idea\nThe study of photosynthesis began in 1771 with observations made by the English clergyman and scientist Joseph Priestley.

Sometimes, you just have to eat the right foods. Certain foods can target belly fat and support your weight loss goals. We’re discussing these foods today to help you get a flatter tummy.\n\n*Apples\nCrisp, juicy apples are a snack you can enjoy guilt-free. The high fiber content in apples keeps you feeling full longer. Its natural sugars provide a sweet treat that won't bust your diet.\n\n*Barley\nTry barley the next time you're in the mood for a grainy plate. It’s a nutty-tasting cereal grain that can reduce belly fat by keeping insulin levels low and stabilizing blood sugar.\n\n*Capsaicin\nCapsaicin is not a food per se. It’s a compound found in spicy peppers that can help boost weight loss. Capsaicin works by increasing thermogenesis. Thermogenesis is required for our bodies to burn calories and fat to generate heat. \nTry to spice up your meals and your metabolism with capsaicin. Cayenne and jalapeño peppers have this compound, for example.\n\n*Cardamom\nCardamom is a lot more than just a flavor addition to your chai tea--it's an aromatic and spicy powerhouse! Cardamom contains compounds that may help to boost your metabolism to increase fat burning while reducing inflammation in your body.\n\n*Flaxseed\nFlaxseed is an exceptionally underappreciated food. These seeds pack lots of fiber and omega-3 fatty acids. Fiber keeps you full for longer stretches of time. Omega-3 fatty acids can beat inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity, which means your body eventually stores less fat. \n\n*Oats\nMost consider them a humble breakfast staple but they're also an extraordinary source of soluble fiber. Oats keep you safe from hunger pangs and improve digestion. Oats also contain resistant starch that increases fat burning and improves insulin sensitivity.\n\n*Raspberries\nThese berries are easy on the stomach and a weight-loss gem. They also have a great dose of antioxidant compounds that can boost your health holistically while also targeting that stubborn belly fat.\n\n\nEat a diverse and balanced diet if you want to maintain a healthy weight. These foods that burn belly fat without sacrificing flavor and fun will fit perfectly in your weight management regimen."", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Generation

Our journalistic investigation has uncovered several potential causes for this alarming new phenomenon.\n\nFirst, many beans had gotten used to the safety hexes that allowed them to permanently avoid the rhinos. Now, with the disappearance of these hexes - rumored to have been locked away in a vault - their previous rhino dodging skills have gotten rusty.

However, now the rhinos won\'t let go until their attacks succeed in eliminating their target. Consecutive attacks are almost guaranteed now. And even worse, they\'ve even learned teamwork, with multiple rhinos forming pincer attacks against a single bean.\n\nFinally, the last theory is that there is a sinister conspiracy that makes Stomping Grounds a much more common map so that the rhinos can find more victims.

"Rewrite this into a bulleted list of key points that shed some light on how to interpret muscle soreness after exercise.

Here’s what muscle soreness can and cannot tell you according to science. Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is something we’ve all experienced and intuitively, you may think it means you had a good workout or that your muscles are growing. Indeed, soreness can be associated with muscle swelling, but that’s edema, water retention in the muscle, not contractile muscle growth. Most of my subscribers are probably aware now that being sore is not necessarily a sign you had a good workout. You can get big without getting sore and getting sore doesn’t guarantee you’ll get big.

However, many people still use muscle soreness as some indicator of recovery after a workout. This is also wrong. Muscle soreness correlates poorly with muscle damage, if it correlates at all. For example, here are the data from a study that measured muscle soreness and creatine kinase elevation, a measure of muscle damage, after a heavy leg day in weightlifters vs. untrained individuals. While the untrained individuals experienced far more muscle damage, soreness levels were actually a bit higher in the weightlifters. The difference in muscle damage was thus not reflected in different levels of soreness. The time-courses of muscle damage and soreness also didn’t correspond well. The untrained individuals were no longer sore at day 6, yet their muscles were still very damaged.

Below are the data from another study that measured muscle soreness vs. strength recovery after endurance vs. maximal eccentric exercise. After the endurance exercise, strength recovered rapidly with most recovery in 24 hours and nearly full recovery at 48 hours (no longer significantly different from baseline), yet this period was when soreness peaked. The eccentric exercise caused considerably more neuromuscular fatigue and strength loss than the endurance training, yet ratings of soreness weren’t that different compared to after the endurance exercise. Other research also finds that certain types of training, such as electrically stimulated muscle contractions, can inflict significantly more muscle damage than conventional strength training without increasing DOMS.

Perhaps the best evidence of the dissociation between soreness and recovery is that training through soreness often doesn’t make it worse. Many of my clients get very sore the first time they do their new workout routines, yet repeating them a few days later while they’re still sore often reduces the soreness. At this point their performance is already slightly greater, indicating that soreness can persist after neuromuscular recovery and even supercompensation have completed.

Soreness may not even be related to muscle damage at the cellular level. There’s emerging research that muscle soreness is more closely related to our connective tissues than our contractile tissues in the muscle. Wilke & Behringer (2021) concluded: “the findings support the hypothesis that DOMS originates in the muscle-associated connective tissue rather than in the muscle itself.”

Soreness also has a significant neural component. Soreness isn’t a direct reflection of muscle or connective tissue damage, as there’s significant modulation of how much we feel a given level of damage. The repeated bout effect majorly reduces the soreness you get from any type of exercise, so you mostly get sore from novel stimuli, even if your habitual workouts are still causing damage and fatigue.

Muscle soreness probably does mean there is some level of damage: you can’t get sore without damage. (Phantom DOMS?) However, the magnitude of soreness doesn’t correlate with the extent of muscle damage or neuromuscular fatigue and certainly not with the extent of muscle growth. You can have high levels of muscle damage or fatigue without soreness.

So basically all a sore muscle tells you is that muscle was involved in some exercise you did earlier. Some people and some body parts get much more sore than others. You mostly get sore after novel training stimuli, such as trying new exercises or higher training volumes. Don’t worry about soreness.

"Rewrite this article as a script for a  host of a children's program on PBS, explaining the four stages of the metamorphosis of moths or butterflies 

There are four stages in the metamorphosis of butterflies and moths: egg, larva, pupa, and adult.

monarch butterfly egg
Egg
Eggs are laid on plants by the adult female butterfly. These plants will then become the food for the hatching caterpillars.

Eggs can be laid from spring, summer or fall. This depends on the species of butterfly. Females lay a lot of eggs at once so that at least some of them survive.

Butterfly eggs can be very small.

monarch butterfly caterpillar
Caterpillar: The Feeding Stage
The next stage is the larva. This is also called a caterpillar if the insect is a butterfly or a moth.

The job of the caterpillar is to eat and eat and eat. As the caterpillar grows it splits its skin and sheds it about 4 or 5 times. Food eaten at this time is stored and used later as an adult.

Caterpillars can grow 100 times their size during this stage. For example, a monarch butterfly egg is the size of a pinhead and the caterpillar that hatches from this tiny egg isn't much bigger. But it will grow up to 2 inches long in several weeks.

monarch butterfly chrysalis
Pupa: The Transition Stage
When the caterpillar is full grown and stops eating, it becomes a pupa. The pupa of butterflies is also called a chrysalis.

Depending on the species, the pupa may suspended under a branch, hidden in leaves or buried underground. The pupa of many moths is protected inside a coccoon of silk.

This stage can last from a few weeks, a month or even longer. Some species have a pupal stage that lasts for two years.

It may look like nothing is going on but big changes are happening inside. Special cells that were present in the larva are now growing rapidly. They will become the legs, wings, eyes and other parts of the adult butterfly. Many of the original larva cells will provide energy for these growing adult cells.

monarch butterfly adult
Adult: The Reproductive Stage
The adult stage is what most people think of when they think of butterflies. They look very different from the larva. The caterpillar has a few tiny eyes, stubby legs and very short antennae. The adults have long legs, long antennae, and compound eyes. They can also fly by using their large and colorful wings. The one thing they can't do is grow.

The caterpillar's job was to eat. The adult's job is to mate and lay eggs. Some species of adult butterflies get energy by feeding on nectar from flowers but many species don't feed at all.

Flying comes in handy. The adult female can easily fly from place to place to find the right plant for its eggs. This is important because caterpillars can't travel far.

Most adult butterflies live only one or two weeks, but some species hibernate during the winter and may live several months.

These plants will then become the food for the hatching caterpillars.\n\nEggs can be laid from spring, summer or fall. This depends on the species of butterfly. Females lay a lot of eggs at once so that at least some of them survive.\n\nButterfly eggs can be very small.\n\nmonarch butterfly caterpillar\nCaterpillar: The Feeding Stage\nThe next stage is the larva. This is also called a caterpillar if the insect is a butterfly or a moth.\n\nThe job of the caterpillar is to eat and eat and eat. As the caterpillar grows it splits its skin and sheds it about 4 or 5 times. Food eaten at this time is stored and used later as an adult.\n\nCaterpillars can grow 100 times their size during this stage. For example, a monarch butterfly egg is the size of a pinhead and the caterpillar that hatches from this tiny egg isn't much bigger. But it will grow up to 2 inches long in several weeks.\n\nmonarch butterfly chrysalis\nPupa: The Transition Stage\nWhen the caterpillar is full grown and stops eating, it becomes a pupa. The pupa of butterflies is also called a chrysalis.\n\nDepending on the species, the pupa may suspended under a branch, hidden in leaves or buried underground. The pupa of many moths is protected inside a coccoon of silk.\n\nThis stage can last from a few weeks, a month or even longer. Some species have a pupal stage that lasts for two years.\n\nIt may look like nothing is going on but big changes are happening inside. Special cells that were present in the larva are now growing rapidly. They will become the legs, wings, eyes and other parts of the adult butterfly. Many of the original larva cells will provide energy for these growing adult cells.\n\nmonarch butterfly adult\nAdult: The Reproductive Stage\nThe adult stage is what most people think of when they think of butterflies. They look very different from the larva. The caterpillar has a few tiny eyes, stubby legs and very short antennae. The adults have long legs, long antennae, and compound eyes. They can also fly by using their large and colorful wings. The one thing they can't do is grow.\n\nThe caterpillar's job was to eat. The adult's job is to mate and lay eggs. Some species of adult butterflies get energy by feeding on nectar from flowers but many species don't feed at all.\n\nFlying comes in handy. The adult female can easily fly from place to place to find the right plant for its eggs. This is important because caterpillars can't travel far.\n\nMost adult butterflies live only one or two weeks, but some species hibernate during the winter and may live several months.\n\n"", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'Host: ""Hey kids! Today we are going to talk about the four stages of metamorphosis of butterflies and months. \n\nDoes anyone know what metamorphosis means? Well, let me tell you, it means a ""transformation or change in shape.""\n\nSo when a caterpillar evolves into a moth or butterfly, they go through metamorphosis. \n\nThe four stages in the metamorphosis of moths and butterflies are egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Let\'s talk about each stage, okay?\n\nThe first stage is the egg stage. The grown-up female butterfly lays her very tiny eggs on plants that then become food for the hatching caterpillars. She lays a lot of eggs to make sure a lot of them live, and depending on the kind of butterfly, eggs can be laid in Spring, Summer or Fall. \n\nCool, huh? \n\nOkay, let\'s move on to the second stage, the Larva Stage. This is also called the caterpillar stage if the insect is a butterfly or moth. In this stage, the caterpillar eats so much because the food is stored and used later as a grown-up moth or butterfly. \n\nDid you know caterpillars can grow up to 100 times their size in this stage? WOW!!! Amazing, right? \n\nThe third stage is the Pupa stage. \n\nWhen the caterpillar is fully grown and stops eating, it is called a pupa. \n\nA pupa may hang from a branch, hide in leaves, or bury underground. The pupa stage can last from a week to a month, or even longer. Some even last two years. WHAT?! \n\nThat can be a long time. \n\nNow kids, it may not look like a lot is going on from the outside, but inside so many changes are happening. Special cells in the larva are growing very fast. These special cells will become legs, wings, eyes, and other parts of the grown-up butterfly. \n\nSome of the cells in the larva will give the growing cells energy. \n\nThe fourth and final stage is the Adult Stage. The adults look very different than the larva stage. For example, look at this [picture of a caterpillar]. Caterpillars have a few tiny eyes, stubby legs and very short antennae. \n\nThe adults [show a picture of a butterfly] have long legs, long antennae, and compound eyes. Compound eyes are clusters of very small receptors that allow insects to see in multiple directions at the same time. Very different than our human eyes. \n\nAnother difference is that adults can fly using their large, colorful wings, but they can\'t grow. \n\nRemember when we said caterpillars can grow to 100 times their size in the larva stage? Well, adults can\'t do that. See, the caterpillar\'s job was to eat, but the female butterfly\'s job is to get pregnant and lay eggs. \n\nSome of the adult butterflies get their energy feeding on nectar from flowers, and some don\'t eat anything at all. \n\nAnother difference between caterpillars and adult butterflies is that adult butterflies can fly to find just the right plant to lay their eggs. This is important because caterpillars can\'t travel that far.\n\nFascinating isn\'t it, kids? Wow, we learned a lot today. Make sure you tell your parents and friends that you learned the four stages of the metamorphosis of butterflies and months. \n\nFirst comes the Egg Stage. \nSecond, is the Larva Stage.\nThird is the Pupa Stage.\nFourth is the Adult Stage. \n\nGood job, kids!

"Rewrite the article. Emphasize the importance of using Hubble for finding black holes.

Astronomers using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope have come up with what they say is some of their best evidence yet for the presence of a rare class of ""intermediate-sized"" black hole that may be lurking in the heart of the closest globular star cluster to Earth, located 6,000 light-years away.

Like intense gravitational potholes in the fabric of space, virtually all black holes seem to come in two sizes: small and humongous. It's estimated that our galaxy is littered with 100 million small black holes (several times the mass of our Sun) created from exploded stars. The universe at large is flooded with supermassive black holes, weighing millions or billions of times our Sun’s mass and found in the centers of galaxies.

A long-sought missing link is an intermediate-mass black hole, weighing in somewhere between 100 and 100,000 solar masses. How would they form, where would they hang out, and why do they seem to be so rare?

Astronomers have identified other possible intermediate-mass black holes through a variety of observational techniques. Two of the best candidates — 3XMM J215022.4−055108, which Hubble helped discover in 2020, and HLX-1, identified in 2009 — reside in dense star clusters in the outskirts of other galaxies. Each of these possible black holes has the mass of tens of thousands of suns, and may have once been at the centers of dwarf galaxies. NASA’s Chandra X-ray observatory has also helped make many possible intermediate black hole discoveries, including a large sample in 2018.

Looking much closer to home, there have been a number of suspected intermediate-mass black holes detected in dense globular star clusters orbiting our Milky Way galaxy. For example, in 2008, Hubble astronomers announced the suspected presence of an intermediate-mass black hole in the globular cluster Omega Centauri. For a number of reasons, including the need for more data, these and other intermediate-mass black hole findings still remain inconclusive and do not rule out alternative theories.

Hubble's unique capabilities have now been used to zero in on the core of the globular star cluster Messier 4 (M4) to go black-hole hunting with higher precision than in previous searches. ""You can't do this kind of science without Hubble,"" said Eduardo Vitral of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, lead author on a paper to be published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

Vitral’s team has detected a possible intermediate-mass black hole of roughly 800 solar masses. The suspected object can't be seen, but its mass is calculated by studying the motion of stars caught in its gravitational field, like bees swarming around a hive. Measuring their motion takes time, and a lot of precision. This is where Hubble accomplishes what no other present-day telescope can do. Astronomers looked at 12 years' worth of M4 observations from Hubble and resolved pinpoint stars.

His team estimates that the black hole in M4 could be as much as 800 times our Sun's mass. Hubble's data tend to rule out alternative theories for this object, such as a compact central cluster of unresolved stellar remnants like neutron stars, or smaller black holes swirling around each other.

""We have good confidence that we have a very tiny region with a lot of concentrated mass. It's about three times smaller than the densest dark mass that we had found before in other globular clusters,"" said Vitral. ""The region is more compact than what we can reproduce with numerical simulations when we take into account a collection of black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs segregated at the cluster's center. They are not able to form such a compact concentration of mass.""

A grouping of close-knit objects would be dynamically unstable. If the object isn't a single intermediate-mass black hole, it would require an estimated 40 smaller black holes crammed into a space only one-tenth of a light-year across to produce the observed stellar motions. The consequences are that they would merge and/or be ejected in a game of interstellar pinball.

""We measure the motions of stars and their positions, and we apply physical models that try to reproduce these motions. We end up with a measurement of a dark mass extension in the cluster's center,"" said Vitral. ""The closer to the central mass, more randomly the stars are moving. And, the greater the central mass, the faster these stellar velocities.""

Because intermediate-mass black holes in globular clusters have been so elusive, Vitral cautions, ""While we cannot completely affirm that it is a central point of gravity, we can show that it is very small. It's too tiny for us to be able to explain other than it being a single black hole. Alternatively, there might be a stellar mechanism we simply don't know about, at least within current physics.""",7ca7f60ad760821de5a944d6b1d9c50b8fc8d603ac140d5a79771b576806f083,"[{'content': 'Rewrite the article.

Yeah, I'm a north sider from Chicago and I bleed Cubby blue but Sosa is nothing short of a legend. He brought baseball back from the brink of obscurity and now baseball just wants to use him as a scapegoat.\n\nEvery baseball fan from the 90s remembers Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire chasing Roger Maris' record and finally eclipsing it. The year was 1998 and it captivated the whole nation. Two men from historic rival teams going all summer long trying to outlast and outhit the other. It was nothing short of epic and without Sosa's race, baseball would not be the popular sport that it is today.\n\nHis resume is impressive too. He hit over 600 home runs which not even 10 players in the entire history of the sport have done. He also won an MVP award in 1998 and numerous other awards like Silver Sluggers and was a perennial all-star. Sammy Sosa embodied baseball in the late 90s and early 00s. But now the industry is doing him wrong by trying to sweep him and all those other great hitters under the rug.\n\nYes, I know it was the steroid era.  But everyone was juicing and we all knew it. It was that unspoken compact that nobody ever brought up because it didn't need to be said. The league knew it and wanted to profit from all the eyes on the sport, we fans knew it but we were enjoying the competition too much to care, and the players knew it but were reaching new heights in their careers. I'm not saying it was okay but I am saying the players we loved shouldn't be the ones bearing the blame for it all. I, as a fan, share in the culpability and still want the best of that era in the hall. Players like Sosa.\n\nSo please don't let his legacy fade away. The numbers back it up and if you want to shave off 100 home runs he's still an amazing athlete. Plus you add on how much he helped revive America's past-time and it can't be denied that Sosa belongs in the hallowed halls of Cooperstown. "", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Generation

Holistic medicine may be the answer to the world’s growing addictions to powerful painkillers and anti-depressants. The dream of Holistic Medicine is to address illnesses with a natural cure. Below are 7 all-natural plants that are used in holistic medicine, with a brief description of each.\n\nArnica: An herb that grows mainly in Siberia and central Europe, as well as in temperate climates in North America. The flowers of the plant are used in medicine. Arnica is most commonly used for pain caused by osteoarthritis, sore throat, surgery, and other conditions. Arnica is also used for bleeding, bruising, swelling after surgery, and other conditions.\n\nTurmeric: Deep gold in color and used for thousands of years by ancient tribes for upset stomachs, wounds, and aching joints. This substance has powerful medicinal properties. It’s an anti-inflammatory that can heal oxidative damage, brighten the skin, and decrease brain fog.\n\nMyrrh: This compound was used by ancient Egyptians in the embalming process. It kills germs, bacteria, and microbes. Myrrh oil has been used for oral problems, to heal wounds, and to combat pain and swelling.\n\nCinnamon: Besides being a highly delicious spice, cinnamon is loaded with antioxidants. Studies have been done to see whether it can cut the risk of heart disease and reduce bad cholesterol. It can lower blood sugar and aid with neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nGreen tea: Not only delicious when drank hot with lemon, but green tea also boosts your heart health and may reduce your risk of cancer. It stimulates hair growth, prevents cavities, and helps with puffy eyes and acne. It even helps with stress and depression.\n\nGinger: A highly flavorful spice for any dish, ginger is well-known to curb appetite and aid with digestion. Ginger dates back to China and is known to help with muscle pain, soreness, and menstrual pains. It can lower cholesterol and improve brain function.\n\nHoly basil: This plant has been used in Indian medicine for centuries. Use its fresh flowers for bronchitis, and the leaves, and seeds, with black pepper, for malaria. Use the whole plant for diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The essential oil is used for insect bites and eczema.', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Generation

Recently, Derrick realized that the other four members had discussed a topic, but he had not been included. And they had given him meaningless tasks to complete, and then when they met, the four agreed among themselves not to use his work. \n\nThe members of the group were all very different.

"Give me a brief overview of what this article is about.

It’s easy to get lost on the dirt roads to John Hume’s place. Located in the open savanna of South Africa’s North West Province, the private land is indicated only by wired fencing along the road. A turn onto a path leading up to Hume’s house reveals a hulking gray mass, just as the blood­-red sun starts to descend across miles of roaming ground. It’s a bull rhinoceros, but he doesn’t look like anything you might find in a wildlife photo book. In place of the magnificent scimitar, the rhino bears a stunted, blunt block of gray nail atop its nose. It’s been cut to save his life and, perhaps, one day, make Hume incredibly rich.
A sturdy man with wire­-frame glasses and graying hair, Hume may be the largest private rhino rancher in the world—with a herd of over 900 and growing. He wakes up before dawn and drives out to sections of his land to check on certain rhinos. He helps his hired hands throw hay and pellets—dietary supplements—into large pits where the rhinos feed. And, when the time comes, he supervises a veterinarian and his workers as they dehorn the animals.

Hume has bred and kept rhinos for the past twenty-­three years, adding to the less than 25,000 black and white rhinos currently in South Africa. His goal is to breed an additional 200 over the next year. While South Africa is home to almost 75 percent of the rhinos in the continent, it also has a far higher rate of horn poaching than neighboring Botswana, where populations linger in the hundreds, or Namibia, where they linger below 2,300. Since a 2009 trade ban on rhino horn was imposed in South Africa, Hume has stockpiled all of the horns he routinely cuts from his herd. He keeps them in hopes of a potential future payoff, when the South African government lifts the ban, if it ever does. But the dehorning also helps ensure the animals’ safety. It’s a measure designed to make the rhinos less attractive to poachers, who are becoming more brazen in their attempts, straying from the relative isolation of large preserves to kill domesticated rhinos on private property.",d072c2b7c52121aed47f9911b852f8d4aad8e5bd0f3ad6d0e29df8fee32fbc2f,"[{'content': 'Give me a brief overview of what this article is about.\n\nIt’s easy to get lost on the dirt roads to John Hume’s place.

"Rewrite this short story from a third-person perspective as if observing the narrator and his behaviour.

True! — nervous — very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses — not destroyed — not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily — how calmly I can tell you the whole story.

It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture — a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees — very gradually — I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.

Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded — with what caution — with what foresight — with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it — oh, so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, so that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly — very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man’s sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! — would a madman have been so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously — oh, so cautiously — cautiously (for the hinges creaked) — I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights — every night just at midnight — but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he had passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.

He fidgeted and twitched with anxiety, noticing every flicker of a shadow as it danced in the twilight. At the faintest sound, like a branch brushing against the roof, the young man's pulse quickened. He would cock his head like a dog trying to pinpoint the exact source of a creak in the floor. At night, he chased imagined noises. He was confident that he could hear voices above and below his bed, but he couldn't quite make out what they were discussing. Was it him?\n\nIt wasn't always like this. For years, the young man was kind and neighbourly towards the old man who lived next door. The old man had been equally kind in return and lived modestly in his humble home. The two men had no qualms, but the young man began to feel unnerved by the old man's eye. One of his eyes was pale blue and with a film over it. Every time the young man felt the unseeing eye fall upon him, his blood ran cold. Over time, the dreadful sensation overwhelmed the young man until he decided that it, and the old man, had to be killed. \n\nThe young man knew that murder was wrong. He knew that the old man was not to blame for his horrible eye, and so was exceedingly kind to him. He did not wish to kill out of passion or madness but instead chose to methodically prepare for the eye's demise. For a week, the young man crept out of his bed at midnight, picked up his lantern and silently slipped into his neighbour's home. He stealthily made his way to the old man's bedroom and inch by inch pushed open the heavy door until he could fit his head inside the opening. Once able, he slowly slid open the sheath to his lantern until a beam of light struck the old man's eye. Night after night, the eye remained closed in sleep; and so the young man swiftly retreated from the room. After all, it was not the man he wanted to kill, but the evil eye. So every morning, the young man would greet the old man at his home with cheery warmth and faux concern about how the old man had slept. Not once did the old man suspect that his young neighbour was entering his bedroom midnight after midnight as the old man slept, awaiting the appearance of the terrible eye.

 Bruce Cassidy saw a lot of the Florida Panthers when he was coaching the Boston Bruins from 2016-22.

But the Vegas Golden Knights coach knows he'll see a different Florida team in the 2023 Stanley Cup Final, starting with Game 1 at T-Mobile Arena on Saturday (8 p.m. ET; TNT, TBS, truTV, CBC, SN, TVAS).

""Obviously we've got our hands full,"" Cassidy said Wednesday.

The Panthers won the Presidents' Trophy as the NHL's best regular-season team in 2021-22 and defeated the Washington Capitals in six games in the Eastern Conference First Round, winning a Stanley Cup Playoff series for the first time since 1996.

But after the Tampa Bay Lightning swept them in the second round, they made significant changes to become more of a playoff-style team this season, most notably hiring coach Paul Maurice on June 22 and acquiring forward Matthew Tkachuk in a trade with the Calgary Flames exactly one month later.

The adjustment was among the reasons they struggled the first half of the regular season. But after a 4-2 loss at Vegas on Jan. 12, which dropped them to 19-20-4, they went 23-12-4 and earned the second wild card in the East. In the playoffs, they have defeated three of the top four teams in the regular season standings: the Bruins (first), Carolina Hurricanes (second) and Toronto Maple Leafs (fourth).

""The biggest thing I've noticed is, the rush game used to kill you [against Florida],"" Cassidy said. ""If you could shut that down, you'd probably be able to outwill them to get to the front of the net, different areas like that.""

The Panthers now create more offense below the goal line, getting pucks deep, forechecking and going to the net front.

Tkachuk is a big part of that. He has 21 points (nine goals, 12 assists) in 16 games, second in the playoffs behind Dallas Stars center Roope Hintz, who had 24 points (10 goals, 14 assists) in 19 games. Tkachuk has four game-winning goals, tied for first in the postseason with Stars forward Joe Pavelski, including three overtime goals, most in the playoffs.

Cassidy said Tkachuk has a high hockey IQ and will challenge the Golden Knights on small-area plays.

""We have to find a way to take away his time and space, yet take away his options, because he moves the puck so quick, so that's going to be a delicate balance,"" Cassidy said. ""And you've got to get into him when he gets to the front of the net. We know that. He's got a great stick and nose for the net. We have some big 'D' that can do that.""

Tkachuk (6-foot-2, 201 pounds) will battle with Vegas defensemen Nicolas Hague (6-6, 230), Brayden McNabb (6-4, 215), Alec Martinez (6-1, 210), Alex Pietrangelo (6-3, 215), Shea Theodore (6-2, 197) and Zach Whitecloud (6-2, 207).",5a54efcd780263ea0d1993362b19ff2945c48e1e9569483a55c519811505fbcf,"[{'content': 'Rewrite this article in the form of several tweets.

"Rewrite this into an enticing episode description for my podcast that will cover the mystery:

Three years ago at the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office, a prosecutor stood over a table, cataloguing items in evidence bags.

“This right here is the shoe,” Assistant District Attorney Michael Sprinkel said in an internal video of the inventory session obtained by CNN through an open-records request. “This is the untested shoe that was believed to be worn in the hospital room on the night of James Brown’s death.”

The items were turned in by Jacque Hollander, a woman who said she could prove the Godfather of Soul was murdered at an Atlanta hospital in 2006. More than a dozen people who knew Brown have called for an autopsy or a criminal investigation.

“He was murdered,” Brown’s manager, Frank Copsidas, said in a 2022 interview. “That’s my interpretation, plain and simple. Somebody wanted him dead.”

After Hollander visited the DA’s office in 2020, prosecutors agreed to check out her story.

But the inquiry was closed in 2021 after a deputy district attorney determined there was “an insufficient basis for the initiation of a Grand Jury investigation,” and authorities took no action regarding Brown’s death.

And then something strange happened to the items in the evidence bags at the prosecutor’s office. They disappeared.

District Attorney Fani Willis has not publicly acknowledged the disappearance. Nor has she given any outward indication that she is trying to find out what happened. Several CNN inquiries on the matter have gone unanswered. The vanishing items in the evidence bags have become another of the many mysteries that still surround Brown’s life and death.

Cat Carrier: It's important to keep your cat safe during travel, so make sure to pick out an appropriate-sized carrier for bringing your kitten home and on future vet trips.\n2. Kitten Food: Kittens need nutrient-packed food to support their growth, unlike adult cats, so make sure to pick out an appropriate food.\n3. Bowls: Food bowls come in many different forms. You could choose an elevated bowl, slow feeder, or automatic feeder, and even treat your cat to a water fountain (which will encourage them to hydrate).\n4. Treats: Treats are one of the best ways to help your kitten bond with you!\n5. Nail Trimmer: Routine nail trims protect your cat from infections and ingrown nails, as well as protect your furniture.\n6: Cat Brush: It's important to keep your cat well-groomed to avoid mats, particularly if your cat has medium or long hair. Long-haired cats should be brushed every day, while shorter hair cats should be brushed around once a week. \n7. Toothbrush and Kitty Toothpaste: To keep your cat's teeth healthy and prevent gum disease, you'll want to introduce your kitten to teeth brushing as early as possible. This helps desensitize them in the future and makes the task easier.\n8. Toys: There are a wide variety of kitten toys on the market, so choose some that look fun and experiment with what your cat likes. Every kitten is different!\n9. Scratching Post: All cats scratch. If you don't give them an outlet, it might be on your couch! Consider spacing multiple scratching posts around the house.\n10. Cat Bed: Your cat may never use their bed, but it's nice to have it if they'd like their own space.\n11. Cat Tree: Cats feel safest in high spots, which means a cat tree can help them feel at home in their new place quickly. Choose one with lots of hiding spots and high-up places for your kitten to call their own.\n12. ID Tag and Collar: While you hope your kitten never sneaks out, if they do, it's critical anyone who finds them can identify them. Make sure their ID tag has your contact information.\n\n"", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

"Find and list the Bio Brite scents in alphabetical order with bullet points.

Bio Brite is also an aromatherapy experience! Available in all of our founder, Shyla's, favorite scentsations (all-natural essential oils of course), designed to improve your mood & help you relax while doing life's mundane. (We also offer scent free!)

Lavender: Known across the French country side for its natural antimicrobial and antiviral properties, lavender is a perfect cleaning companion. It is also used for its ability to calm the nervous system, reduce stress & anxiety, reduce inflammation, increase happy hormones, support restful sleep, and even lower blood pressure! (In one study, women who smelled lavender for 30 minutes a day during the first three days of their period had less pain after 2 months!)

Lemon Zest: Some people swear by lemon essential oil as an ingredient to fight exhaustion, help with depression, clear your skin, kill harmful viruses and bacteria (again, perfect cleaning companion!), and reduce inflammation. Research supports that it is a powerful calming and mood-improving agent. A 2006 study showed that lemon essential oil was actually more effective at relieving stress than other essential oils such as lavender and rose. A small 2016 study found that lemon essential oil reduced anxiety among people after undergoing orthopedic surgery.

Coconut Cream: Feel the warm sweet breezes of paradise whispering around you at first inhale. Be transported to exotic beaches & balmy nights. Unlike other scents that only give a short-term scent fix, the natural ingredients in this scent give you sustained relief from stress and anxiety as you take care of business.

Nag Champa: This earthy scent (which is actually a blend of sandalwood & magnolia) originates out of India. Nag chama is commonly used during mediation & mindfulness practices for its ability to improve mental clarity, reduce stress levels, and improve sleep quality. Channel your inner zen with Shyla’s favorite scent!",78d06ff490cc6943aeeb69c5c9fa4e3a3ff1b0b7b67bb04a983d845ad95e11e6,"[{'content': ""Find and list the Bio Brite scents in alphabetical order with bullet points.\n\nBio Brite is also an aromatherapy experience!

"Use less expressive or alternative adjectives than the source text provides.

It’s a bold move to title your first album Legacy, but by 2013 Kavain Space had earned the right. The Chicago producer, better known as RP Boo, was already legendary in his hometown, having spent the mid ’90s DJing for the House-O-Matics dance crew at parties across the South Side. In 1997, he released “Baby Come On,” which many view as the origin point of the frenetic footwork style. The track features syncopated drums churning around 160 bpm, the preferred tempo of footwork producers, and an Ol’ Dirty Bastard sample chopped and looped ad infinitum. Boo released the mixtape Dude Off 59th Street in 2007 and contributed two tracks to Planet Mu’s essential 2010 collection Bangs & Works Vol.1 (A Chicago Footwork Compilation). Legacy, though an archival release, was a complete statement of purpose, a crucial document of his madcap ability to sculpt snarky vocal taunts, jagged chunks of pop hits, and skittering drums into otherworldly club cuts.

A decade later, RP Boo offers us Legacy Vol. 2, a sequel equally worthy of the title. Vol. 2 returns to the beginning of the millennium, collecting pieces recorded between 2002 and 2007 (both “Eraser” and “Total Darkness” appear on Bangs & Works). Though he would later begin composing in Ableton, Boo made all of his early work with the minimalist arsenal of an Akai MPC and a Roland R-70 drum machine, and he leaves the songs’ seams visible, which can feel jarring at first. Some loops lope haphazardly, ending with the staccato click of a digital artifact; it often sounds like Boo is triggering samples in real time. He deliberately sets clashing sounds against each other, like the horror-movie drone and “Live and Let Die” vocal sample of opener “Eraser,” and adjusting to the lurching, hyperactive rhythms can take some patience. Though the music sprang from Chicago house, footwork deliberately deconstructs that genre’s quantized, four-on-the-floor grid—the guiding pulse just isn’t there in most cases.",2093437bfd07f63a59354c14ff7b0f3ca97e8fc8cc42c138a0f65f736829e262,"[{'content': 'Use less expressive or alternative adjectives than the source text provides.\n\nIt’s a bold move to title your first album Legacy, but by 2013 Kavain Space had earned the right.

"Rewrite this short story as if it were set in a magical world

A shoemaker, by no fault of his own, had become so poor that at last he had nothing left but leather for one pair of shoes. So in the evening, he cut out the shoes which he wished to begin to make the next morning, and as he had a good conscience, he lay down quietly in his bed, commended himself to God, and fell asleep. In the morning, after he had said his prayers, and was just going to sit down to work, the two shoes stood quite finished on his table. He was astounded, and knew not what to say to it. He took the shoes in his hands to observe them closer, and they were so neatly made that there was not one bad stitch in them, just as if they were intended as a masterpiece. Soon after, a buyer came in, and as the shoes pleased him so well, he paid more for them than was customary, and, with the money, the shoemaker was able to purchase leather for two pairs of shoes. He cut them out at night, and next morning was about to set to work with fresh courage; but he had no need to do so, for, when he got up, they were already made, and buyers also were not wanting, who gave him money enough to buy leather for four pairs of shoes. The following morning, too, he found the four pairs made; and so it went on constantly, what he cut out in the evening was finished by the morning, so that he soon had his honest independence again, and at last became a wealthy man. Now it befell that one evening not long before Christmas, when the man had been cutting out, he said to his wife, before going to bed, ""What think you if we were to stay up to-night to see who it is that lends us this helping hand?"" The woman liked the idea, and lighted a candle, and then they hid themselves in a corner of the room, behind some clothes which were hanging up there, and watched. When it was midnight, two pretty little naked men came, sat down by the shoemaker's table, took all the work which was cut out before them and began to stitch, and sew, and hammer so skilfully and so quickly with their little fingers that the shoemaker could not turn away his eyes for astonishment.

He possessed only a solitary piece of enchanted leather, capable of crafting a single pair of shoes. With a heavy heart, he carefully marked the leather in preparation for the next day's work. As the moon graced the sky, casting its ethereal glow, the shoemaker sought solace in dreams and whispered wishes.\n\nAs the sun heralded a new day, the shoemaker was greeted by a breathtaking sight. Resting upon his worktable were two exquisite shoes, woven with threads of enchantment. The stitches danced with vibrant energy, a testament to the mystical forces at play. Bewildered and grateful, he couldn't fathom the origin of this fantastical gift.\n\nNews of the extraordinary shoes spread across the magical lands, capturing the attention of a curious sorcerer. Eager to possess such extraordinary craftsmanship, the sorcerer offered a princely sum, surpassing all expectations. With the newfound wealth, the shoemaker procured enough magical materials to fashion two more pairs of shoes.\n\nNight after night, the magical ritual unfolded. The shoemaker would prepare the materials, retire to his bed, and awaken to find the shoes completed by unseen hands. The shoes held an undeniable allure, attracting patrons far and wide, each enamored by their otherworldly beauty.\n\nAs the shoemaker's prosperity grew, a notion took root within his heart. On the eve of the Winter Solstice, he shared his plan with his enchantress wife. They resolved to unravel the mystery, to witness the enchantment unfold before their eyes. With eager anticipation, they lit mystical candles and concealed themselves, eager to uncover the truth.\n\nWhen the clock struck midnight, the veil between worlds wavered, and two whimsical pixies materialized. Their tiny forms radiated with magical luminescence as they settled at the shoemaker's table. With nimble fingers and mischievous giggles, they wove spells into each stitch, infusing the shoes with enchantments that could captivate even the most jaded heart. The couple observed in awe, their spirits lifted by the sight of magic in its purest form.\n\nAs the last stitch was sewn, the pixies bid their farewell, vanishing into the night. The room brimmed with an aura of gratitude and wonder, for the shoemaker and his wife had been touched by the very essence of their mystical realm.\n\nEmbracing their newfound prosperity, the shoemaker and his wife became revered artisans, crafting shoes that whispered tales of magic to those who wore them. Their creations traversed kingdoms, bridging the gap between ordinary lives and extraordinary possibilities.\n\nAnd so, in the realm of enchantment, the tale of the shoemaker and his magical shoes became a legend, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, the spark of magic could ignite dreams and transform destinies."", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Rewrite

', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'Sure! \nHere are four ways that you can make eggs more fulfilling for breakfast without scrambling them! \n\n1. Add a “sunny side up” egg to a bowl of grits. \n\nWhen you have a heaping helping of grits in the mornings, put an over-easy egg on top. Then break the yolk and mix it around until bits of runny yolk and cooked egg whites are dispersed throughout the grits. The richness of the egg yolks combined with the buttery goodness of the grits will give your tastebuds an oomph of flavor and satisfying texture. \n\nAdditionally, grits are rich in iron while eggs are dense with protein and good fats. It’s a nutritious, tasty breakfast all around! \n\n2. Deviled eggs are quick, yummy on-the-go foods. \n\nTo make deviled eggs, you boil whole eggs, peel them, and cut them in half, then scoop out the semi-solid yolks. Mix the yolks with mayonnaise, salt, pepper, sweet pickle relish, and a hint of yellow mustard. Then spoon the yolk mixture back into the center of each egg half. Sprinkle with paprika and voila – a delicious, nutritious, more flavorful way to eat eggs!\n\n3. Poach an egg and put it over an English muffin with hollandaise sauce. \n\nThis method of eating eggs is called Eggs Benedict and it’s a savory way to enjoy a hearty breakfast. \n\nUsing water and a tablespoon of vinegar, crack an egg into the liquid and allow it to boil for 3 minutes, then scoop the egg out of the water with a slotted spoon. You can then place it on top of a toasted half of an English muffin with a spoonful of hollandaise sauce. To increase the flavor, you could also add smoked salmon between the egg and muffin before you spoon on the sauce. \n\n4. Toast, avocado, and eggs – simple, easy, and delicious. \n\nSometimes the best, most fulfilling breakfast is the simplest and easiest to prepare. Toast a couple of slices of bread to your liking and add sliced avocado on top. Then add an over-easy egg over your avocado. To spice things up, you could use a sprinkle of everything bagel seasoning on top of your eggs. Enjoy! \n\nSide note: Make sure you have a napkin handy since this play on eggs and toast can get a little messy when the egg yolks burst.  \n', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

The low intelligence of the stupid raccoon makes the animal easy prey for other animals that are normally considered docile and unprovoking, such as rabbits and turtles.\n\nThe stupid raccoon is a docile, furry little creature that has the same physical appearance and characteristics as that of regular raccoons, but with one notable exception: they are absolutely stupid. Where other animals have the situational awareness and survival skills to scavage for food and shelter, stupid raccoons are unable to feed themselves unless humans put scraps of leftover dinner into plastic garbage bags and put them into garbage receptacles for easy access and consumption. However, while some of these raccoons have easy access to these tasty morsels of leftover food, many of them can become trapped in larger trash bins, becoming stuck and unable to escape back to their natural habitats. These stupid raccoons eventually require human intervention - in the form of a passerby noticing the raccoons inside and lending a helping hand - or they will eventually be transported along with the trash within these receptacles and taken to a nearby landfill where they will die from suffocation underneath thousands of tons of human refuse.\n\nStupid raccoons are living beings that deserve our help, just like any other creature on our beautiful planet. Without intervention, approximately 32,000 are expected to die each year, resulting in a dwindling population that can impact the ecosystem and a lot fewer of these stupid (but cute) animals on the planet. While they are unbelievably dumb creatures, stupid raccoons are also important to our ecosystem. The raccoons provide such vital functions as entertainment for humans, emotional support for ants, and natural garbage disposals for trash.\n\nWith your donation of just five dollars a minute, we can help round up the stupid raccoon population and put them into safe living areas that will provide them with the opportunity to survive and thrive without falling victim to the harsh environment of the urban world.

', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': ""Here are five creative ways you can save money.\n\n1. Join loyalty programs.\nOftentimes, people shop at the same places for regular purchases. An example is shopping at the same grocery store every week. If you are doing this, determining whether the places you shop have loyalty programs that reward consistent customers is well worth your time. These loyalty programs will allow you to gain rewards for future shops. In the long run, this can save you lots of money. If your grocery store doesn't offer a loyalty program, it's worth checking the closest one that does. Weighing up the cost of extra fuel and time to get there will help you to decide if it's worth trying somewhere new. \n\n2. Use cash-back credit cards. \nIf you are responsible with money and do not have problems paying off credit cards, look into getting a high cashback credit card. Like loyalty programs, this will help you get extra rewards for simply doing what you are already doing. Extra money with minimal extra work is always good when trying to save money. Often times you will receive cashback on just about anything, so using your cash-back card for all your purchases and then paying the balance straight off could lead to great returns over a long period. It is essential to remember to pay off your card as the interest you gain through not doing so will likely exceed your cash-back, leaving you worse off. \n\n3. Cancel subscriptions you are not using. \nCheck your monthly outgoings and see if there are any subscriptions you are not using. If you find any, it would be best off to cancel them. This will mean a monthly bill is removed, which is excellent as these monthly bills can add up to a lot over time. The quicker you cancel, the faster you save. Many TV or Telephone will even offer a lower rate to customers considering leaving. This means that contacting and informing them of your plans to leave could mean they offer you a significant discount to stay. Doing this yearly can really help to keep your bills down in the long run. There is no harm in saying you will leave unless your bills go down. They can only say no. \n\n4. DIY where possible. \nDoing DIY instead of hiring a tradesman can really save you a lot of money. These days it couldn't be easier to find tutorials and how-to videos online for most DIY projects. Ensure you watch these videos before purchasing any materials or tools to ensure you are confident in completing the task to a high standard. If you have a lot of time on your hands, this is one of the best ways to save money as you also learn a valuable skill that you can use as a second income. DIY doesn't just mean working at home, though. It can even mean taking your own coffee or lunch at home instead of buying it out for a higher price.\n\n5. Set up automatic payments for bills. \nLife is tough, and it's hard to remember everything. You shouldn't be charged fees when you forget to pay a bill. But unfortunately, late fees are a fact of life, and sometimes they can damage your bank balance. By setting up automatic payments for your bills, you can ensure you never get charged late fees or accrue interest on any account you may have. An added bonus is that this will save you time meaning you have more to make money. "", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

Which is best for freelancers?\n\nWell, that depends on what your circumstances are. The main difference is that a Roth IRA is not taxable upon withdrawal; however, your contributions are not tax deductible. With a traditional IRA, you will be taxed upon withdrawal; however, you may benefit from tax deductions for contributions. \n\nYou could open both accounts, but be sure to keep total contributions below the IRS's annual limit of $6,500.\n\nTweet 4- \nFreelancers, open a SEP IRA! \n\nThe SEP IRA is tailored for business owners or the self-employed.

"Rewrite this information about the possible health benefits of anthocyanins found in fruits and vegetables into a rap song.

1. Lowers blood pressure

Anthocyanins may help reduce blood pressure, according to a review of 66 studies. Study participants with hypertension took a variety of extracts and preparations from anthocyanin-containing plants. The study found there was a consistent lowering effect on blood pressure. In other studies, however, researchers identified many factors that led to mixed results, such as:

    Dosage and type of anthocyanin (food, juice, freeze-dried powder or extract).
    Number of doses (single vs. long term).
    Patient characteristics (a person’s baseline blood pressure and other health conditions).

This study highlights the need for more research to establish a dosing regimen and determine who might benefit from anthocyanins.
2. Reduces risk of heart disease

Atherosclerosis is when plaque builds up on the inside of your arteries. This buildup can cause high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, peripheral artery disease or kidney failure.

The formation of plaque is a multi-stage process that depends on many factors. Prescott says that research shows that anthocyanins can intervene at different stages in the process by reducing:

    Cholesterol, a main part of plaque.
    High blood pressure, which can damage blood vessels and make them more likely to develop atherosclerosis.
    Inflammation, which leads to plaque formation.

3. Prevents neurological diseases

Research shows that anthocyanins can help protect and improve your brain function:

    One study found that a daily dose of cherry juice improved speech and memory in people aged 70 and over with mild or moderate dementia.
    Another study reported anthocyanins increased blood flow to and activated brain areas that control memory, language and attention.

Researchers believe that anthocyanins’ antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are responsible for these improvements. 
4. Slows cancer growth

Anthocyanins may act in many ways to slow or stop cancer. Studies suggest that anthocyanins might:

    Block the changes in DNA that cause cancer.
    Destroy cancer cells or stop their growth.
    Prevent tumors from becoming malignant (cancerous).
    Reverse drug resistance and increase tumors’ sensitivity to chemotherapy.

However, Prescott cautions that the research on anthocyanins and cancer has mainly happened in the laboratory. There are only limited data from clinical trials on people. Researchers need to continue to investigate these findings so they can determine exactly how anthocyanins affect cancer growth and treatment.",9b20635ff42e620b9087e47d46cf3cc4dd1e36e02570a8aeccaf6f395497eacc,"[{'content': 'Rewrite this information about the possible health benefits of anthocyanins found in fruits and vegetables into a rap song.\n\n1.

"Rewrite this text as if it's a narration for a dramatic space documentary.

Capable of both destruction and creation, space volcanoes are common on planets and moons throughout the solar system and beyond.

Volcanoes account for some of Earth's most interesting and violent geographical features, a force for destruction and creation. However, volcanic activity isn't limited to our planet and  space volcanoes are often found on other planets and moons. 

Within our solar system, the moon and Mars are rich with evidence of volcanoes and fiery volcanic activity, while other bodies possess volcanoes that spew ice from their frozen vistas. 

VOLCANOES ON THE MOON
Now volcanically inert, the surface of the moon once hosted spectacular eruptions that created lava flows that extended as far as 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) from their source, according to San Diego State University. 

A recent Chinese mission to the lunar surface — the Chang'e-5 lander — returned lava that seems to indicate Earth's primary natural satellite was volcanically active more recently than previously believed.

The sample collected from Oceanus Procellarum on the moon's near side,  previously associated with recent volcanic activity, suggests volcanism as recently as two billion years ago, a full billion years later than previous estimates.

VOLCANOES ON MARS
Aside from Earth, the planet humanity has studied the geology of most intensely is Mars. This has led to the discovery that the Red Planet is host to even more volcanic features than our planet, according to Arizona State University.

Primary among these is Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the entire solar system at twice the height of Mount Everest. It is surrounded by a plethora of other massive volcanoes.

In addition to this, Mars' other volcanoes includes Elysium, Syrtis Major, and a cluster of low-profile volcanic structures near the Hellas impact basin. This basin is the lowest point on Mars and the third- or fourth-largest known impact crater in the solar system.

Mars seems to be volcanically inactive, but when this happened is something astrogeologists are still attempting to figure out. 

The volcanoes in the Tharsis  — the location of Olympus Mons  —  show few asteroid impact craters, meaning they could be just a few million years old, which is fairly young in geological terms. 

Mars was clearly very active in its youth, with explosive eruptions petering out as it aged. The planet has no active volcanoes, according to the National Air and Space Museum, and it appears most of the heat once stored in the planet's interior has been lost. 

It is possible we are currently simply seeing Mars in a geologically quiet period and that volcanism could restart on the Red Planet. 

VOLCANOES ON OTHER PLANETS
Many other planets in the solar system have been linked with volcanic activity with most of these having occurred when the solar system was young and violent.

The closest planet to Earth, Venus, has lava flows that cover up to 90 percent of its surface. Venus has up to 1,600 major volcanoes and could have as many as a million smaller counterparts to these.

What isn't certain is if the planet is still volcanically active. Though we have yet to see a volcano erupt on any other planet, Venus is shrouded by thick clouds of sulfuric acid, meaning long-distance observations are difficult. Visiting the planet with a probe is complicated by its intense pressures and temperatures.

Images captured by the MESSENGER mission have shown that Mercury's surface was shaped by volcanic activity. Lava flows on the closest planet to the sun have been dated to be between one and two billion years old. This means that volcanic activity continued well after Mercury formed around 4.5 billion years ago.

For active volcanoes, one has to look beyond the planets of the solar system to its moons.

VOLCANOES ON MOONS
According to an article by NASA, the most volcanic body in the solar system is Io, one of Jupiter's moons, this activity is caused by the tremendous gravitational influence of the gas giant deforming the tiny moon. 

Not only does Io have volcanoes that spew blisteringly hot lava, but the Jovian moon also hosts cryovolcanoes. These ice volcanoes which occur on planets and moons located away from the sun erupt cold, liquid, or frozen gases like water, ammonia, or methane.

Io is punctuated with hundreds of volcanic vents, many of which blast jets of frozen gas hundreds of miles into Jupiter's atmosphere. 

Cyrovolcanoes were first observed on one of Neptune's moons, Triton when the Voyager 2 craft caught a glimpse of five mile-high plumes of nitrogen gas during its 1989 flyby of the Neptunian system.

These eruptions are caused when solar radiation heats nitrogen below Triton's surface, vaporizing it, causing it to expand and eventually erupt from the Neptunian moon's icy surface. Eventually, this material condenses and falls back to the surface of Triton, giving it a smooth snow-covered surface. 

In 2005, the Cassini spacecraft observed ice jets released from the southern polar region of Saturn's moon Enceladus. Cassini actually flew through one of these eruptions discovering it to be mostly comprised of water vapor with some nitrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide.",8382ba7ef3409dd65c95f90f544ddbb1600727356ea08f9f2a63a2c003b969c1,"[{'content': ""Rewrite this text as if it's a narration for a dramatic space documentary.\n\nCapable of both destruction and creation, space volcanoes are common on planets and moons throughout the solar system and beyond.\n\nVolcanoes account for some of Earth's most interesting and violent geographical features, a force for destruction and creation.

"Briefly summarize what this scientific news article says about the phenomenon of gravitational lensing caused by massive cosmic objects like galaxy clusters.

Here's the source text:
The 1915 theory, which is occasionally called Einstein's geometric theory of gravity, predicts that, as bowling balls placed on a trampoline create a depression, objects with mass cause the very fabric of space-time to warp. This curvature gives rise to the force of gravity. And the greater the mass of a cosmic object, the more extreme the warping of space it causes.

Light travels across the universe in straight lines, but when it encounters a warp caused by a truly massive object, its path is curved. When the warping object is between Earth and a background object, it can curve light in such a way that the apparent position of the background object is shifted.

But when the intermediate or ""lensing object"" is truly massive — like a monstrous cluster of galaxies, for example — light from the background source takes a different amount of time to reach Earth depending on how close it passes to the natural cosmic lens. 

This effect, called gravitational lensing, can make single objects appear at multiple points in the sky, often in stunning arrangements called Einstein rings and Einstein crosses. It can also cause background objects to appear amplified in the sky, a powerful effect that astronomers use to observe distant and early faint galaxies.

The distortion caused by massive clusters like eMACS J1823.1+7822 can also help astronomers study mysterious dark matter, which accounts for around 85% of the mass in the universe but is invisible because it does not interact with electromagnetic radiation. Because dark matter does interact gravitationally, however, the lensing of light by a galaxy or galactic cluster can help researchers map the distribution of dark matter.",a45cd509a67af11568e4080ed875900ccceec2ba9b02dc1cedb65b9f59e0ccd6,"[{'content': 'Briefly summarize what this scientific news article says about the phenomenon of gravitational lensing caused by massive cosmic objects like galaxy clusters.\n\nHere\'s the source text:\nThe 1915 theory, which is occasionally called Einstein\'s geometric theory of gravity, predicts that, as bowling balls placed on a trampoline create a depression, objects with mass cause the very fabric of space-time to warp.

You have a couple of months left before the beaches become the go-to destination to beat the heat. If you want to lose some of that extra weight or want to be able to fit in that bikini, here are some tips that will help you get there:\n\n1. Drink water - drinking enough water to stay hydrated through the day will not only keep you healthy, but it will also help to clean your system. Plus, it can fill you up and help curb your hunger.\n2. Cut out the excess carbs - carbohydrates (rice, sugar, sweets) are okay in moderation, but eating more than a candy bar a day will put extra sugar into your system that your body will not be able to burn off. This extra sugar will be turned into fat. Consider cutting down on the excess carbs and only consuming enough to get you through the day.\n3. Fast - fasting doesn't necessarily require you to go days on end without eating any food. Lots of studies show that intermittent fasting (16-hour fasts) can be more than enough to help your body burn off any excess fat, due to the body needing energy to continue running and borrowing from fat reserves to keep going.\n4. Exercise - get out and move about! Any exercise (even just walking 30 minutes a day) can burn calories and slim your body down.\n5. Portion control - here's a good rule of thumb: if you eat three meals a day, make sure each portion of your meal (carbs, protein, vegetables) are the size of your closed fist. This is a good measurement of how much food you should be eating per meal, and it is a quick way to judge how much you should have without needing measuring cups or scales.\n6. Cut out the fats - as with carbs, limit the amount of fat you eat. Too much fat in your mouth means too much fat on your hips.\n7. Lift weights - resistance training helps to boost your fat-burning capability and tone your body.\n8. Sleep - not getting enough sleep can stunt your metabolism while you are awake."", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Generation
"Rewrite this description of how to deal with negative thoughts and emotions into a set of instructions.

...we call these insistent visitors or difficult repetitive thought patterns the Top Ten Tunes. Normally when thinking arises, we can simple name it ""thinking, thinking,"" and in the light of awareness it will vanish like a cloud. However, the Top Ten Tunes, whether as words, images, or stories, will persist and return no matter how often they are noticed. They play like records, repeating a theme over and over. At first, to gain perspective, we can number them one through ten. ""Oh, that is three on the hit parade this week."" In that way, when we notice them, we don't have to play the record all the way through each time and we can more easily let them go. Or we can use a variation of the technique and give them a humorous name or title. I have given names to many now familiar aspects of myself, such as ""The Hungry Survivor,"" ""Mr. Achiever,"" ""Attila the Hun,"" ""Baby Jack,"" ""Fear of the Dark,"" ""The Impatient Lover."" In this way, the repeated patterns of fear, sorrow, impatience, or loneliness become more familiar, and I listen to their stories in a friendlier and openhearted way. ""Hello, nice to see you again! What do you have to tell me today?""

However, this is not enough. Suppose we encounter a repeated story about the divorce of our parents. It talks over and over about which children go to keep which possessions, and who said what to whom. Such a story can play many times. As it does, we must expand our field of attention: How does this thought feel in our body? Oh, there is a tightness in the diaphragm and the chest. We can name this, ""tightness, tightness,"" and stay meticulously attentive for some time. As we do, it may open to other sensations, and many new images and feelings will be released. In this way, we can first begin to release the physical contractions and bodily fear that we have held. Then we can expand the attention further to new feelings. What feelings arise along with this thought pattern and this tightness? At first they may be half hidden or unconscious, but if we sense carefully, the feelings will begin to show themselves. The tightness in the chest will become sadness, and the sadness may become grief. As we finally begin to grieve, the pattern will release. 

In a similar way, when we encounter a repeated physical pain or difficult mood, we can expand awareness to the level of thoughts, the story or belief that comes along with it. With careful attention, we may find a subtle belief about ourselves that perpetuates the pain or mood, perhaps a story about our unworthiness, such as ""I'll always be this way."" When we become aware of the story or belief, and see it as just that, often the pattern is released. 

Repeated thoughts and stories are almost always fueled by an unacknowledged emotion or feeling underneath. These unsensed feelings are part of what brings the thought back time and again. Future planning is usually fueled by anxiety. Remembering of the past is often fueled by regret, or guilt, or grief. Many fantasies arise as a response to pain or emptiness. The task in meditation is to drop below the level of the repeated recorded message, to sense and feel the energy that brings it up. When we can do this, and truly come to terms with the feeling, the thought will no longer need to arise, and the pattern will naturally fade away.",97a8c42a8db4f5540c863153ca0b9e269a08228ec9dfbc40c9ac3977e6c32459,"[{'content': 'Rewrite this description of how to deal with negative thoughts and emotions into a set of instructions.\n\n...we call these insistent visitors or difficult repetitive thought patterns the Top Ten Tunes.

No one knew where it came from, or how to stop it. But the world was soon sure of one thing, the Covid-19 pandemic had begun.\n\nAs the virus spread like wildfire across the globe, fear and panic gripped the nations. As governments struggled to contain it and medical professionals worked tirelessly to save lives, the world started to shut down. Travel bans, strict quarantines, and non-essential work shutdowns occurred to try to slow the spread. Still, the virus raged on relentlessly, and the death tolls rose higher and higher with every passing day.\n\nAs the world teetered on the brink of total collapse, a multi-national team of hero scientists raced against time to develop a vaccine. But vaccine creation is slow and viruses mutate and evolve each time they are passed to a new host. The virus became more deadly with each passing day.\n\nAmidst all of the international chaos, other heroes emerged - groups of ordinary people banded together to fight back against the virus and bravely help those in need. These front-line workers risked everything to help those in need and battled the virus with all they had.\n\nSadly, the virus had other plans for our world. Governments scrambled to implement new restrictive measures to contain the virus. Soon, we'd learn viruses can't be truly contained.\n\nAs the pandemic continued to drag on, the toll on humanity felt unbearable. So many losses and permanent injuries occurred. But a glimmer of hope emerged from the dark reality. The scientists developed a vaccine, and the world collectively held its breath as it was distributed to those in need. Would it be enough? Or would the disease continue to mutate and evolve and require boosters or yearly shots? \n\nFind out in the new reality thriller - *Pandemic*!\n\nIn a world where nothing is certain, one thing is clear: the Covid-19 pandemic is a thriller like no other, a fight for survival against a silent enemy that threatens to destroy us all."", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Generation

Felix Hernandez - No room to argue here - ""King Felix"" is the best pitcher in Mariners history. He spent 15 seasons in Seattle and was a fan favorite the entire time. He won the Cy Young Award in 2010 and was an All-Star six times. Hernandez is the Mariners\' all-time leader in strikeouts, wins, and innings pitched.\n\n2. Randy Johnson - Johnson played nine seasons at the start of his career with the Mariners, he is one of the greatest pitchers of all time. His youth and incredible size and pitching speed were combined with bouts of wildness in his first seasons. He was must-see television every start. He won the Cy Young Award in 1995 and 1997 and was an All-Star five times while a Mariner. More importantly, he was a pivotal piece of the 1995 team that was the first Mariners squad to make the postseason.\n\n3. Jamie Moyer - Moyer spent 11 seasons with the Mariners and won 145 games. It\'s amazing to think that the second-most-winning pitcher in franchise history is known more for consistency and preparation than ""stuff"". He threw slowly and deliberately with a knack for driving opponents crazy. He had two 20-win seasons and was an All-Star in 2003. He finished top 10 in Cy Young voting three times. Moyer also pitched a no-hitter for the Mariners in 1996.\n\n4. Mark Langston - Langston spent six seasons with the Mariners and was an All-Star in all six seasons. He had 1,074 strikeouts in 1,062 innings pitched with the team. Langston\'s dominance on the mound helped set the tone for the Mariners in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Plus, when he was finally traded the team received Randy Johnson as part of the package. A gift that kept on giving!\n\n5. Hisashi Iwakuma - Iwakuma is a bit of an under-the-radar selection given that he only played six years with the team. However, he had some incredible seasons with the team, including a 2013 campaign that saw him finish 3rd in Cy Young voting. His effort and loyalty to the team are fondly remembered during what was generally a dark period for the franchise.', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Generation

Some bosses are labeled in the game's files as bosses, and others aren't labeled bosses but are called bosses by people who play the game. Here is a list of bosses in Pikmin:\n\n1. Goolix - The Goolix is a Pikmin boss that looks like a blue amoeba. It fights by encapsulating Pikmin within itself, which will drown them. It is impossible to fight if you don't have blue Pikmin, but blue Pikmin can fight it without being injured. You can only find the Goolix after day 9 on odd-numbered days in the impact site,\n2. Burrowing Snagret - Snagrets are creatures that pop out of the ground and look like a mix between a snake and a bird. When they fight, they unburrow and eat several Pikmin and then burrow back down for safety. In the Forest of Hope, there are 3 Snagrets in the same location. The best way to fight a Snagret is to attack as they try to emerge from the ground. Then before it has a chance to shake them off, whistle them back.\n3. Beady Long Legs - Beady Long Legs - Arachnophobes beware, the Beady Long Legs is a massive spider. It stomps around, and Pikmin die as it steps on them. It also drops from the ceiling abruptly when you find it, which can immediately crush Pikmin. It helps to fight it with a smaller team of Pikmin, as large teams can more easily be crushed. It also helps to have Yellow Pikmin, as they can be thrown higher than others. This boss resides in the Forest Navel.\n4. Armored Cannon Beetle - The Armored Cannon Beetle is a boss that isn't labeled as a boss. This beetle has armor surrounding its body. It also has a blowhole that sucks in before it shoots out a boulder. The ball that rolls can crush several Pikmin and only stops when it hits a wall or other enemy. To fight it, you need to clog its blowhole, which will then make it expose its abdomen which can be attacked. Its blowhole can be clogged by Pikmin. You can find the armored cannon beetle in The Forest of Hope.\n5. Emperor Bulblax - This is the final boss of Pikmin. It looks like it's covered in sludge with moss growing out of it. The Emperor Bulblax waits in the ground for its prey and pops up as you pass by. To defeat this enemy, you need to use Yellow Pikmin to feed it bomb rocks. It fights by eating, and when it sticks out its tongue, you can throw the Pikmin with bomb rocks at it. This boss can be found in the area called The Final Trial."", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

"Rewrite this text as a Jeopardy-style Q&A in which all the answers are the titles of the films or theater projects starring Tom Holland.

Thomas Stanley Holland (born 1 June 1996) is an English actor. His accolades include a British Academy Film Award and three Saturn Awards. Some publications have called him one of the most popular actors of his generation.

Holland's career began at age nine when he enrolled in a dancing class, where a choreographer noticed him and arranged for him to audition for a role in Billy Elliot the Musical at London's Victoria Palace Theatre. After two years of training, he secured a supporting part in 2008 and was upgraded to the title role that year, which he played until 2010. Holland made his film debut in the disaster drama The Impossible (2012) as a teenage tourist trapped in a tsunami, for which he received praise. After this, Holland decided to pursue acting as a full-time career, appearing in How I Live Now (2013) and playing historical figures in the film In the Heart of the Sea (2015) and the miniseries Wolf Hall (2015).

Holland achieved international recognition playing Spider-Man/Peter Parker in six Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) superhero films, beginning with Captain America: Civil War (2016). The following year, Holland received the BAFTA Rising Star Award and became the youngest actor to play a title role in an MCU film in Spider-Man: Homecoming. The sequels Far From Home (2019) and No Way Home (2021) each grossed more than $1 billion worldwide, and the latter became the highest-grossing film of the year. He had another action film role in Uncharted (2022), and also expanded to play against-type roles in the crime dramas The Devil All the Time (2020) and Cherry (2021). Holland has additionally directed the short film Tweet (2015) and voiced roles in computer-animated features, including Onward (2020).",3492fab95892bfeab2425ec256a4c9d207e447e60e6bdc6c213537af7594bb58,"[{'content': ""Rewrite this text as a Jeopardy-style Q&A in which all the answers are the titles of the films or theater projects starring Tom Holland.\n\nThomas Stanley Holland (born 1 June 1996) is an English actor.

"", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': ""I can help with that! Here are some groceries to stock up on in preparation for oral surgery recovery:\n\n- Eggs: Scrambled eggs are easy to prepare and, as long they aren't overcooked, have a perfect texture for someone with sore teeth. They can be paired with lots of different flavors and can be suitable for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.\n\n- Oatmeal: Oatmeal makes a great healthy breakfast option for oral surgery recovery. It's extremely easy to prepare and can be mixed with cream, brown sugar, and cinnamon for a sweet treat. \n\n- Instant mashed potatoes: This is a staple for recovery from oral surgery. The texture is easy on the teeth, gums, and jaw, the flavor is mild and easy to pair with just about anything, and the carbohydrates in the potatoes help keep patients' energy levels up. \n\n- Yogurt: The soft texture of yogurt is easy on the mouth, but that's not the only reason to add it to your grocery list. While recovering from oral surgery, you may be prescribed painkillers and antibiotics. Both of these medicines can be tough on the digestive system, so the probiotics in yogurt can help prevent digestive discomfort if eaten daily. \n\n- Apple sauce: The texture of apple sauce makes it perfect for recovery from oral surgery. Plus, apple sauce makes a quick and easy snack at any time of day. It's healthy for a sweet snack, too, with a healthy dose of fiber and a relatively low calorie count.\n\n- Rice: If slightly overcooked, rice becomes very soft and easy to consume. You could add it to warm broth or soup for some extra texture, or make it into rice pudding for dessert.\n\n- Macaroni and cheese: Cook the pasta a little longer than the recipe advises to make this dish nice and soft. \n\n- Ice cream: You may not want to use ice cream to replace more nutritious meals, but the texture and temperature can be soothing to an inflamed mouth. Also, recovering from surgery can be quite unpleasant, so having some sweet treats in the freezer can help to keep patients' morale high. \n\n- Popsicles: Like ice cream, fruity popsicles can be soothing to the mouth due to their cold temperature. Popsicles may be a healthier alternative to ice cream, though.\n\n- Canned or jarred purée soups: You can find prepared soups in many different flavors, such as tomato, butternut squash, carrot ginger, cream of mushroom, and more. Just try to steer clear of soups with meat, whole beans, or large vegetable chunks in them. \n\n-Avocadoes: Once avocadoes are ripe and soft enough, they make a wonderful addition to other savory foods on this list like scrambled eggs or mashed potatoes. They are full of healthy fats, fiber, and protein. \n\n- Bananas: Let these fruits get a bit overripe and mash them before consuming. You can mix mashed bananas with yogurt or cottage cheese for a snack.\n \n- Tofu: Tofu is soft enough for oral surgery recovery, but can add a little extra texture to dishes like scrambled eggs, as well as extra protein.\n\n- Soft-cooked vegetables: Most vegetables, when overcooked, become soft enough that they can be mashed like potatoes. Some popular choices for oral surgery recovery are mushy peas, overcooked zucchini or squash, caramelized onions, roasted tomatoes, and sauteed spinach. Add these softened veggies to mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, soft cooked rice, or macaroni and cheese for a full and nutritious meal. "", 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm

He then took Drogon, the last living dragon, and flew to King’s Landing. There, he faced the Unsullied and the Dothraki, who were loyal to Daenerys and wanted revenge for her death. Jon spoke to them in their languages, telling them that he loved Daenerys, but he had to kill her for the sake of the realm. He also revealed his true identity as Aegon Targaryen, the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. He asked them to join him in restoring peace and justice to the land or to leave and find a new home. Some of them agreed to follow him, while others chose to sail away.\n\nJon then entered the Red Keep, where he was greeted by Tyrion Lannister, who had been imprisoned by Daenerys for treason. Jon freed him and asked him to be his Hand. Tyrion accepted but warned him that ruling was not easy and that he would face many enemies and challenges. Jon responded that he was not afraid and that he would do his best to honor his duty and his family.\n\nJon then summoned a council of the lords and ladies of the seven kingdoms. He told them that he did not want to be king, but he felt that it was his responsibility to unite the realm and heal the wounds of war. He asked them to swear allegiance to him or to choose someone else. The council agreed that Jon was the best option and hailed him as King Aegon VI Targaryen. Jon thanked them but said that he would not rule alone. He declared that he would break the wheel of tyranny and oppression and create a new system of government. He said that from now on, the king or queen would be elected by a council of representatives from each kingdom, and that each kingdom would have more autonomy and rights. He also said that he would rebuild the Night’s Watch and send some of his men to guard the Wall and protect the North from any future threats.', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Generation

He is a new father, so these presents will be his first fathers Day presents ever.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '1. Sleep Aid Devices: As a new parent, sleep may be more challenging to come by than ever before in his life. Consider giving your husband a sleep aid device – like a white noise machine – that will help him fall asleep quickly when he has a few minutes to a few hours before the next feeding.\n\n2.\tCoffee (Or tea/hot chocolate) Gift Baskets: If the sleep aid device is insufficient and he still needs extra caffeine create a gift basket of flavorful caffeinated beverages. This can include coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. You may want special mugs, stirring spoons, and a new coffee maker or kettle. If he spends much time away from home, you can also include gift cards to his favorite coffee houses.\n\n3.\tPersonalized Father Keychain: Personalized gifts are always a fantastic idea. Whether money is tight or you want to get him one more small gift, a keychain that says Father or Dad is a great idea. You can also get one from your child that says something like Daddy, I love you and the child’s name.\n\n4.\tA daddy/baby matching outfit. This could be a t-shirt or t-shirt or sweatshirt for dad and a matching onesie or sleep-and-play for the baby. It is super cute when they go out or spend time together.\n\n5.\tMatching sports jerseys for daddy and baby. If daddy wants to watch football with their baby every Sunday, you should encourage him and get them matching jerseys. But them Brady, Mahomes, Allen, or Rodgers jerseys (or whoever his favorite quarterback or other player is). Of course, suppose your husband prefers hockey, baseball, basketball, soccer, or another sport. In that case, you can also get those types of matching jerseys.\n\n6.\tApple Air Tags: Becoming a parent can have many confusing or frazzled moments. This can include forgetting where you put essentials like your keys, phone, or wallet. Apple Air Tags are the answer to that issue! If he is not an Apple customer, you can get him Tile Mates, instead.\n\n7.\tFood Gifts: Most dads will not say no to chocolate and snacks like mothers. Create him a gift basket of his favorite treats, or get him a nice box of chocolates.\n\n8.\tA Book of Dad Jokes: Now that he is a father, it is time to learn the secret language of dads and master the dad joke.', 'role': 'assistant'}]",Brainstorm
