We consider how farmed animals might benefit from reforming laws around animal transport. We compare transport campaigns to other campaigns that the movement can pursue instead (e.g. on-farm welfare reform and slaughter reform). Overall, we expect that transport reform will benefit animals far less than other types of campaigns - animals experience transport for only a very short period of their lives (less than 1% of animal-years). Of course, we always find it emotionally challenging to recommend that a particular group of animals should not be a focus of campaigns, but it is important that the animal advocacy movement's limited resources go towards doing as much good for animals as possible.",1

For example, animal advocacy organisations may occasionally have the opportunity to push for higher-welfare transport regulations with only a small investment of time and energy. Transport could form one part of an overarching welfare campaign that also focuses on other parts of the animals' lives. If you are aware of particular transport reforms that could be costly to the farming industry, this could help make farming less profitable (though we haven't yet seen any examples of this). Also, there may be opportunities to improve transport regulations when existing standards or regulations come up for public consultation and review, or when animal transport catastrophes are publicised in the media. For organisations that are nevertheless keen to campaign to improve animal welfare during transport, we provide links to some resources that can help you to develop new welfare asks in your own country or jurisdiction.",2

We chose these case studies to illustrate the problems with live animal transport across a variety of species, industries, and countries. All three of these case studies arrive at similar conclusions: there are numerous welfare challenges facing the animals, and suffering appears to be common. However, transport accounts for a very small proportion of the lives of farmed animals. In all three cases, when you account for the animals who are farmed but not transported, less than 1% of the lives of farmed animals are experienced during transport. This means that the benefits of reforming animal welfare during transport, while potentially meaningful for the animals affected, would only prevent a very small amount of the suffering imposed on animals by farming. This supports our general case that improving animal welfare during transport should not currently be a priority for animal advocacy organisations.",4

In countries with existing animal welfare regulations during transport, further animal welfare reforms would typically bring about minor improvements (60% confidence). This claim may not apply in contexts where there are no animal welfare regulations during transport (e.g. fish in China).

Most of the suffering experienced due to transport is minor or moderate pain, rather than extreme pain (55% confidence). For argument's sake, if we imagine that all of the suffering experienced during transport is extreme pain (which is highly unlikely), transport reform could still only prevent a few hours of extreme pain per animal at most. This might make transport appear more competitive than slaughter reform, but not more competitive than cage-free reforms or the Better Chicken Commitment. (Some people believe that it is most urgent to prevent suffering that is extreme, which makes slaughter reform appear even more competitive.)",10

When regulations or standards come up for review, there is often an opportunity for the public and organisations to submit their views. This is a relatively low investment of energy (i.e. preparing and submitting a single document), but it can nevertheless encourage the government or other body to consider improvements to animal welfare standards in transport.

Occasionally, there are high-profile events relating to animal transport that are publicised in the media. For example, a ship from the EU that capsized in 2019, killing 14,000 sheep (4), and there have also been multiple instances of highly-publicised animal welfare catastrophes in the Australian live export industry (5). (Sometimes these media stories are the result of investigations or publications by animal advocacy organisations.) When these events occur, they naturally generate a lot of public outrage, and it makes perfect sense to focus this outrage on achieving reforms for animals in transport. At this time, animal advocacy organisations could encourage policymakers or corporations to adopt higher animal welfare standards, given the public attention.

It is possible that there are some ways that transport reform could be costly to the farming industry. We haven't seen any examples of this, but it is possible that there are particular policies in any given country that could impose large costs on producers and farming companies. This could help make the farming industry less profitable, which might lead to the industry farming fewer animals. If you have specific ideas for how transport reform could accomplish this in your jurisdiction, then this would be one reason why you might consider campaigning for transport reform.",15

Improve temperature limits: We believe that this ask could be considered for a campaign. Data is scarce, which means that the impact of this ask is highly uncertain and risks being small or negligible. But it is possible that this ask could reduce suffering from heat and cold stress on some journeys. This would only affect animals who are transported during extreme temperatures and only for the duration of those journeys, and this would only prevent suffering for some of those animals.

Decrease journey lengths: We believe that this ask would be promising for a campaign. There is strong evidence that shorter journey lengths improve the welfare of transported chickens. However, even if this ask resulted in relatively strict limits on journey durations, the total effect would mostly be to shave a couple of hours off of the end of 20-30% of journeys. Again, this might be a small, meaningful improvement for the animals affected, though it would only benefit those animals for a couple of hours each.",38

Of course, the asks would apply to other farmed animals too (e.g. pigs, cows, and so on). However, considering only one group of animals makes the calculations much more straightforward for the third ask (""Decrease journey lengths""), as each different group of animals have different journey lengths. It is important for our calculations to be comparable across the three asks, so we consider only chickens across all three asks. We do not think that explicitly adding other groups of farmed animals to the calculations would add much more information in terms of decision-making. Chickens account for roughly 97% of farmed land animals transported in Poland, according to the report commissioned by Otwarte Klatki (27). This is also true across the EU in general (7,28).

Chickens transported each year

1.2 billion (lower, moderate estimates). According to the report commissioned by Otwarte Klatki, 1.2 billion is the number of chickens transported domestically in Poland (27).

1.44 billion (upper estimate). According to the same source, 1.44 billion is the number of chickens transported domestically in Poland plus those chickens imported or exported (27).

Current rate of non-compliances on transport

0.24% (lower estimate). This is the rate of non-compliances recorded in official data from inspections of Polish animal transport from 2007 - 2016, according to Wasilewski et al (29).

2.95% (moderate estimate). This is the rate of non-compliances recorded in official data from inspections of Polish animal transport from 2015 - 2019, according to the report commissioned by Otwarte Klatki (27).

20.69% (upper estimate). This is the rate of non-compliances recorded in official data from inspections of Polish animal transport from 2012 - 2017, according to Tereszkiewicz et al (30). The sample size is very small, so we do not think this estimate is as sound as the lower and moderate estimates. Notably, this figure is similar to 20.9%, which is the rate of non-compliances found in an academic analysis of official data of cow transports from France to Italy (31).

Decrease in rate of non-compliances due to additional inspections/CCTV

5% (lower estimate); 10% (moderate estimate); 30% (upper estimate).

We do not have strong evidence about this parameter. We have used these three numbers as rough guesses, based on our informed judgement and previous research on animal welfare inspections.

All anecdotal evidence suggests that additional inspections / installing CCTV does reduce the number of non-compliances, so this percentage should be above 0%. A meta-analysis found an average 13% reduction in crime in public places after the installation of CCTV (not specific to animals) (32). Further context on the effects of surveillance cameras is provided in Animal Ask's report on CCTV in slaughterhouses, available here.

We have previously conducted research on the effect of inspections on non-compliances with farmed animal welfare legislation (not publicly available). Given that research, we would forecast that additional inspections could plausibly reduce the number of non-compliances by roughly 5 - 30%.

Average journey time (hours)

3.5 hours (lower, moderate estimates). This is our best guess of the average journey time for journeys within a single EU state. This is simply two-thirds of the 5.5-hour figure used in the upper estimate (see next dot point), since that 5.5-hour figure corresponds to a journey between two EU member states.

5.5 hours (upper estimate). This is a rough estimate of the duration of a journey between two EU member states, based on data reported by the EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (7).",61

There have been some studies on the rates of mortality and different behaviours of chickens transported at various temperatures (34,35), but it is not immediately clear how these translate to heat stress or cold stress.

Secondly, what is the actual pattern of journeys (e.g. most common times of day or times of year) in which animals are transported in Poland?

We roughly estimate the number of journeys that take place during existing temperature limits in Poland. We then roughly estimate the number of journeys that take place during plausible, stricter temperature limits in Poland. This allows us to roughly estimate the number of journeys, and thus the number of animals, that would experience more moderate temperatures due to this ask.

We assume that temperature limits apply to external temperatures. In fact, the EU legislation considers internal temperatures (temperatures inside the vehicles), not external temperatures. However, we do not have data on internal temperatures. Also, the UK is moving towards regulating the external temperatures rather than internal temperatures, so the EU could possibly follow suit.

We assume that journey times are randomly distributed throughout the day (e.g. equally likely to take place at 12pm vs 12am) and throughout the year (e.g. equally likely to take place in summer vs winter, etc). This is a necessary assumption because we don't have any data on when journeys actually occur. In fact, it is likely that journeys are non-random and more likely to take place at some times of day than others, and at some times of year than others - companies might tend to avoid transporting on days with extreme temperatures anyway, due to increased mortality and practical difficulties, though we're speculating here. Together, these first two assumptions allow us to use historical temperature data from Poland to make approximate guesses about the percentage of journeys that would be restricted by any particular temperature limit.

Chickens transported each year

1.2 billion (lower, moderate estimates). See ask #1.

1.44 billion (upper estimate). See ask #1.

Rate of compliance with temperature limits

82% (lower, moderate, and upper estimates). This is approximately the compliance with temperature limits observed in a small study of temperature during EU animal transport (36).

Plausible reformed temperature limits

5 - 25 degrees (lower, moderate estimates). These are the limits planned for chickens in the UK's new transport policy (8). It might therefore be reasonable for the EU and its member states, including Poland, to follow suit.

-10 to 30 degrees (upper estimate). These are the limits that were initially suggested to us as part of this ask. These are less stringent limits, and the government and industry might be more supportive of these limits than the above, stricter limits.

Percentage of chickens transported outside of these temperature limits who would experience temperature stress

60% (lower estimate). We simply do not have sufficient data to make an informed estimate of this value. This is our best guess for the percentage of chickens transported outside of -10 and 30 degrees who would experience temperature stress.

30% (moderate, upper estimates). Again, we simply do not have sufficient data. This is our best guess for the percentage of chickens transported outside of 5 and 25 degrees who would experience temperature stress.

We can guess that the average journey length would then be a little bit below 8 hours, as the industry's response may involve building new slaughterhouses around the country.

For the 16% of journeys of greater than 12 hours, these journeys might also be reduced to 6 - 8 hours. The total effect of this new limit would therefore be something like: the journey time of 11% of chickens is reduced by about 3 hours, and the journey time of 16% of chickens is reduced by about 7 hours.

We set a plausible duration limit to which journeys could be limited in Poland. For journeys above this limit, we calculate a rough average journey time. We do the same for journeys below this limit. This allows us to roughly estimate how the average journey time would be reduced as a result of implementing a new duration limit. By incorporating information on the percentage of journeys currently above the new, hypothetical limit, we can calculate the number of animals who would experience a shorter journey.

We assume that this ask could reduce journey times for adult chickens, but not new chicks. In the strictest transport policies that we're aware of (e.g. the new UK policy), adult chicken journeys can be limited to very short times (4-8 hours) but the journeys of new chicks are only limited to 24 hours, which is the same as current EU legislation.

Adult chickens transported each year:

Note that this differs from the ""chickens transported each year"" in the above two asks, as our assumption (above) is that this ask only reduces journey time for adult chickens.

In the EU, about 58% of chickens transported across member states are adult chickens (7). We assume that 58% of chickens transported in Poland are adult chickens. This results in the following estimates:

700 million (lower and moderate estimate), which is 58% of 1.2 billion (see ask #1).

840 million (upper estimate), which is 58% of 1.44 billion (see ask #1).

New journey limit (hours):

8 hours (lower and moderate estimate). In the RSPCA Assured standards, journeys for hens are limited to 8 hours (9). In practice, if this limit were established, the average journey might end up being a little bit below the new limit.

4 hours (upper estimate). In the new UK policy and RSPCA Assured standards, journeys for broilers are limited to 4 hours (8,44).

Percentage of chickens transported for longer than these journey limits who would experience suffering:

25% (lower estimate). We simply do not have sufficient data to make an informed estimate of this value, so we have used a plausible stand-in value for each scenario. 

50% (moderate estimate).

75% (upper estimate).

Percentage of current journeys that exceed the new limit:

18% (lower estimate). Data provided by the EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare shows that 27% of journeys between member states involving chickens are longer than 8 hours. Since we're actually interested in journeys within a single member state, the 27% is probably an overestimate. So, we multiply the 27% by two-thirds to very roughly account for this, resulting in 18%.

33%. Data provided by the EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare shows that 49% of journeys between member states involving chickens are longer than 4 hours. Since we're actually interested in journeys within a single member state, the 49% is probably an overestimate. We multiply the 49% by two-thirds to very roughly account for this, resulting in 33%.

We calculate the reduction in journey time as: average journey time for journeys that do exceed the new limit minus average journey time for journeys that do not exceed the new limit. 

For journeys that do exceed the new limit, average journey time (hours):

12.37 hours (lower and moderate estimates). This is an approximate estimate based on data provided by the EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare.

9.51 hours (upper estimate). This is an approximate estimate based on data provided by the EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare.

For journeys that do not exceed the new limit, average journey time (hours):

8 hours (lower estimate). This conservatively assumes that the average journey time will be reduced to exactly the new, 8-hour limit.

6 hours (moderate estimate). This is a guess, assuming that the average journey time will be reduced to a bit below the new, 8-hour limit (which we believe is more likely).

2 hours (upper estimate). This is a guess, assuming that the average journey time will be reduced to a bit below the new, 4-hour limit (which we believe is more likely).",96

This Regulation contains provisions on: the fitness of animals for transport; suitable means for transport; loading and unloading; training and handling; and space, food and water. Journeys over 8 hours are subject to further provisions. The Regulation also applies to animals being exported from the EU, even after leaving the EU (46). 

The EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare recently published a detailed report of the welfare of chickens during transport in the EU (7). The Panel found that the major welfare consequences facing adult chickens during transport are '(i) handling stress, (ii) injuries, (iii) restriction of movement, (iv) sensory overstimulation, (v) motion stress, (vi) heat stress, (vii) cold stress, (viii) prolonged hunger, and (ix) prolonged thirst'. For day-old chicks during transport, the major welfare consequences are '(i) handling stress, (ii) sensory overstimulation, (iii) motion stress, (iv) heat stress, (v) cold stress, (vi) prolonged hunger and (vii) prolonged thirst'. The Panel's report contains a literature review on each of these welfare consequences, including prevalences for some.

When it comes to animals transported in the EU in general, the main welfare issues are the transport of unfit animals; loading and unloading; and overcrowding and temperatures during transport (46). There have been a number of reports - written by the government, animal advocacy organisations, or academics - showing that Regulation 1/2005 is not properly enforced (46). The main breaches involve the transport of unfit animals and the failure to meet requirements on stocking density, temperature, rest, feed and water, and bedding (47,48). Independent analysis of official data shows frequent non-compliance with requirements for rest and limits on journey durations (31).

There appear to be major welfare challenges caused by live export in particular. Official reports concluded that 'most transporters do not meet applicable EU rules after leaving the Union' (49) and that, at the EU-Turkey border specifically, lengthy border delays and heat stress mean that 'there is a high risk of causing unnecessary pain and distress to animals transported on this route during hot days' (45).",107

These Standards regulate the sourcing of animals, animals' on-farm preparation, land transport, vessel preparation and loading, and on-board management of animal health and welfare (59). Specific areas of health and welfare that are covered include space requirements, temperature limits, feed requirements, and veterinary medicines, as well as the thresholds at which mortality levels must be reported.

There have recently been a few government reviews of animal welfare during live export. The Technical Advisory Committee reviewed the ability of the previous version (2.3) of the standards to ensure the welfare of animals (59). The Committee suggested a number of changes relating to sourcing and preparation of the animals, space requirements, heat stress, and on-board management (e.g. bedding, fodder, personnel). The McCarthy Review was  a more specific, shorter review on the health and welfare of the sheep during the Northern Hemisphere summer (60). McCarthy concluded that a number of changes were needed, mainly relating to space requirements, heat stress, and enforcement of the Standards.

A number of academic publications have reviewed the state of animal welfare during live export from Australia. Phillips (51) lists the numerous factors that harm animal welfare before, during, and after the ship voyage - these include mustering, shearing (for sheep), transport to feedlots, reduced food and water intake, road and rail transport, loading, unloading, and several changes of environment that can cause fear and anxiety. On the ships, the major stressors are likely to be disease, heat stress, high stocking densities, high ammonia levels, food availability, stress, noise, and disturbance to lighting patterns. The whole process, beginning on farms in Australia and ending with slaughter in the importing country, can last 1-2 months during which the animals can be handled 5-6 times. Phillips and Santurtun (61) concluded that 'there are significant risks to the welfare of livestock caused by transporting them in ships, especially over long distances'. And Foster and Overall (50) point out that, compared to other live-exporting countries, Australia's live export involves much longer distances and journeys. They also discuss the poor enforcement and problems with the regulatory regime. 

There have also been some major incidents publicised in the media. In 2017-18, the media published undercover footage, taken on voyages from Australia to the Middle East and provided by Animals Australia, that showed sheep on the voyages experiencing severe suffering (60,62). This motivated the government to commission an independent review into the standards of sheep exported to the Middle East and to accelerate the review timeline for the broader standards that apply to the entire live export industry (see above reviews). There were similar publicised incidents in 2011 when Animals Australia conducted an investigation into conditions in slaughterhouses in Indonesia, and 2012, when a shipload of allegedly diseased sheep were slaughtered en masse in Pakistan. Following the 2011 incident, the federal government attempted to place stricter regulations on the industry, though this was later ruled unlawful in a court decision (63,64).",114

For this period of the animals' lives, the animals' welfare would be governed by the laws in the importing country, not Australia. It is possible that the importing countries have weaker animal welfare laws than Australia does. But Australia's animal welfare laws are not great (65,66), so this is not certain and could be worth investigating further. Abolishing live export from Australia would mean that the animals spend their entire lives in Australia with their welfare governed by Australia's laws, rather than part of their lives in the importing country. Likewise, if animals experience injuries and psychological trauma from transport, a longer period between transport and slaughter might increase the suffering that is caused by these problems. Both of these factors could provide additional benefits of banning live export. Merely reforming the conditions on live export ships, as opposed to banning live export entirely, would not have this effect.",117

The evidence suggests that almost all fish farmed in China are transported live, as customers typically have a preference for live or freshly killed fish (70,71). Notably, around 7% of fish produced in China die during transport3 (71,72).

Most pond loaches farmed in China appear to be sold locally, though some are exported to Korea or Taiwan (76).

Yang et al (71) conducted interviews with stakeholders involved in live fish transport in China. Fish are typically transported in sealed tanks or, for small-scale transport, plastic bags or foam boxes. Before transport, fish are often captured manually using dipnets, or sometimes with pumps or cage traps. Loading can occur a few hours before transport starts, and there may also be a wait between transport and unloading. Customers may take fish home alive in sealed plastic bags. Live transport typically happens in winter rather than summer, as summer temperatures can cause poorer fish health and lower survival rates. The use of anaesthetics is uncommon. Some respondents believed that aquatic animals were not sentient, or that animal welfare is only relevant to land animals, though others believed that welfare should be considered for fish as it is for land animals.

Jia et al (75) reports on the transport of three species: Chinese perch, largemouth bass, and longsnout catfish. Together, these species account for about 3% of fish farmed in China. Jia et al's study examines transport from production in Guandong province to wholesalers in Beijing. Wholesalers report mortality with reports varying from very low (e.g. 0%) to very high (e.g. 60% or even 100% in some cases). Before transport, fish are captured on farms and moved to containers filled with pond water and equipped with oxygen cylinders. These containers are taken via truck to company processing plants where fish are unloaded and sorted into tanks before being anaesthetised with carbon dioxide and kept in holding tanks for 3 - 12 hours. During the main journey, fish are transported in water and ice in styrofoam boxes, which are connected to an oxygen cylinder. Each box is about 26 litres and can hold 10 - 25 kg of fish (roughly 15 - 30 individuals). Each truck carries up to 600 boxes. The journey is 2,300 km, which takes 30 - 48 hours. Fish can be offloaded directly to wholesalers or transferred to another truck for transport to other markets. When the fish arrive at the market, it can be 1 - 3 hours until the customer receives the fish.

Nie et al (77) give an overview of live fish transport in China. There are many different transportation methods and packaging methods, depending on the journey distance, the volume of fish being transported, the customer (e.g. wholesalers vs restaurants), etc. While other countries often use specialist transport vehicles, Chinese fish transport instead involves modified trucks. This makes it more difficult to control the environment during transportation, which contributes to the low survival rate of fish. The use of anaesthesia can improve the survival rate and increase the transport density. The authors discuss the development of ""less water"" and ""no water"" transportation techniques, which first originated in Japan. This involves inducing a state of dormancy in the fish and transporting the fish in containers with very little or no water, before awakening the fish at the end of the journey. This technique is being developed in China, though it has not yet seen widespread uptake in China.

It has been estimated that 7% (by weight) of fish produced in China die during transport (71,75). This high mortality has been attributed to inappropriate transport procedures and monitoring.

There is a code of practice for the transport of live fish in China (78). This code outlines practices for packaging, the environmental conditions of the fish, food safety, and so on.",123

Food retail is very concentrated, and retailers have lots of power over prices (5).

Livestock markets are well-integrated across the country, so changes in production volume and price in one part of the United States will trigger responses in other parts of the country (6).

Fish and crustaceans markets are complicated. Different seafood products can be substitutes or complements, and this can change for different regions within the United States (7,8).

The stated intent of this policy is to reduce the market power of meat packing companies, which the Biden administration hopes will reduce the price of meat (11). However, meat packing companies, despite being large, don't actually have much market power—retailers do (10). Therefore, the Biden administration's policy of breaking up large meat packing companies might increase, not decrease, the price of meat.

The United States exports the meat from around 1.6 billion broiler chickens each year (around 20 percent of domestic production), though the country only imports the meat from roughly 60 million broiler chickens each year (less than 1 percent of domestic production). This includes both meat and live chickens. Most of the chicken exports from the United States are destined for Canada, Mexico, China, and other countries in Asia and Central America. Notably, the United States competes with chicken producers in Argentina and Brazil for access to the Chinese market (16). This means that policies that affect chicken production in the United States can also have knock-on consequences on chickens farmed in these other countries.",43

The supply chain is dominated by very large companies called integrators (17,18). Integrators control multiple segments of the supply chain, supplying the birds and the feed to farmers and then processing the chickens during and after slaughter (19). The farmers, who sign contracts with the integrators, supply the land, facilities, and labor (17). These contracts can require the farmers to build barns to particular specifications, which often requires a large up-front investment from the farmer (20). Given this large investment and the fact that most areas only have a handful of integrators, it can be very difficult for many farmers to switch to a different integrator or leave chicken farming altogether (20,21). This means that the integrators have a very large amount of power, and the farmers very little (20).",44

This is despite the fact that there are around 43,000 actual chicken farms in the country. The reason is two-fold—a small number of these farms produce most of the chickens, and each large integrator holds contracts with many farmers. Chicken companies have occasionally been involved in price-fixing, and the past 50 years have seen numerous lawsuits against this (21).",45

The states have lots of power over the lives of animals, and most of the animal welfare reforms in the United States happen at the state level. It is possible to speak to legislators in a particular state (state representatives) and ask them to introduce particular regulations. These regulations can involve animals produced in that state or, as in the case of California's hen welfare legislation, animals produced in other states but sold in that state.

Ballot initiatives. In many states and cities, it is possible to propose new regulations for direct vote—this has been a very successful strategy in securing hen welfare reforms in many states (15,23). Also, ballot initiatives and state-level legislative lobbying can support each other (23,24). For a detailed look at ballot initiatives, see the report by Jason Schukraft and the report by Aashish Khimasia.

Corporate campaigns. It is possible to ask retailers and food businesses to only buy meat farmed to specific welfare standards. This has been an overwhelmingly successful strategy over the past few decades (25–27). However, since corporations are often hesitant to speak with more than one animal advocacy organisation at a time, there are now fewer opportunities for new organisations to conduct corporate campaigns.

University or caterer campaigns. It is possible to speak with the people who oversee university dining halls and catering businesses, and encourage them to switch some of their ingredients to plant-based foods (28).

Environmental campaigns. The United States has many environmental regulations, but animal agriculture businesses do not always obey these regulations. Poorer environmental conditions are often observed around feedlots, which can harm people living in the area (29). It is possible to get the federal government to enforce regulations that are already on the books, thereby increasing the costs for some businesses. This strategy was used in a grassroots campaign in Iowa, utilising a ""not-in-my-backyard"" mentality among residents (30). On the other hand, this might just cause the production to shift to another location, rather than actually decrease.

Lobbying the Office and Management and Budget (OMB). The OMB, an office housed under the executive branch of the federal government, holds a large amount of power over how regulations are implemented and enforced in practice (31,32). If an organisation is aware of when the OMB is reviewing a particular regulation, it is usually straightforward to obtain a meeting with the OMB (31).",50

Over the past 50 years, it has been very rare for Congress to pass new animal welfare laws—this is partially because of lobbying by agricultural interests and partially because Congress has been happy to leave animal welfare regulation to the states (33,34). More recently, due to the Congressional gridlock over the past decade or two, it has become difficult for Congress to pass new laws on any topic. Of all the bills proposed in Congress, only ~1 percent actually get passed into law, and these tend to be the non-controversial, bipartisan bills (35). Due to the reluctance of Congress to touch animal welfare and the dysfunction of Congress in general, it would be more fruitful to focus on the other routes to change outlined above.",51

This study tested the effect of two types of CCTV cameras (in-aisle CCTV public view monitors and in-aisle CCTV domes) on the rate of shoplifting of razor blades, a valuable, frequently shoplifted item. The results showed that both types of CCTV cameras caused a notable and statistically significant decrease in the rate of shoplifting. The authors suggest that this decrease occurred because the CCTV cameras increased the perceived risk of detection.",42

This study involved CCTV schemes that had been implemented to address violent crime, social disorder, and narcotics activity.

In England, CCTV cameras were only required by law after a large proportion of slaughterhouses had already installed them. The use of CCTV in slaughterhouses was required by most major food retailers and by RSPCA's Freedom Food certification scheme, and it was recommended by other certification schemes and associations (4). In 2010, around 7% of slaughterhouses had installed CCTV (4). This number increased gradually until 2016, when around 50% of red meat slaughterhouses and 70% of poultry slaughterhouses had adopted CCTV for animal welfare purposes (29). Requirements by certification schemes and retailers encouraged slaughterhouses, particularly those belonging to larger businesses, to adopt CCTV, which in turn may have reduced opposition to the subsequent legal regulations. In fact, when large producers voluntarily adopt new animal welfare practices, those large producers often lobby the government to make those practices legally binding to avoid other producers having an economic advantage (32).

Another is reducing provocation, which may involve reducing frustrations and stress, avoiding disputes, reducing emotional arousal, neutralising peer pressure, and/or discouraging imitation (1,37).

This can be both through direct material consequences from the tactics, such as economic damages, or through indirect societal pressure.

Attention: This represents how salient the tactic makes the issue in the public mind, and particularly in the minds of important officials.

Convincingness: This represents the proportion of people who are won over as a result of the tactic (as opposed to just acquiescing to the demands through pressure).

Contextual action logic: This represents how much this tactic makes sense in the context of animal advocacy with particular attention to its action logic. Action logic refers to how much the action itself directly or symbolically implies the goal of the action. Tactics with high action logic will be more easily scrutable to the public and could be more likely to elicit sympathy rather than confusion (Beautiful Trouble n.d.).

High action logic in the context of animal advocacy would include open rescues where the goal and the method align.

Low action logic would be cases where the action does not transparently relate to the goal, such as throwing soup at a painting.

The value of action logic has not been studied in the literature on social change. Though it is implicitly valued by many of those carrying out actions as well as experts on the topic. Özden et al. (Özden, Rogers, and Wouters 2023) finds that, of the 40 experts surveyed for the question, 88% believe that actions with strong action logic are more likely to be effective than those without strong action logic.

Risks/negative externalities:  This represents the possible risks as well as expected negative consequences, such as harm to activists, financial risks, legal risks, reputational risks, and risks of repression.

Two staff members were subsequently dismissed and convicted of animal cruelty charges.” If an investigative documentary was able to accomplish this much, we would have hoped that a further 17 years of campaigning against the company, including the use of very risky and costly tactics, would accomplish significantly more.",132

This survey measures reputation through the ratings of companies on nine criteria, from investment value and quality of management and products to social responsibility and ability to attract talent by a large sample of executives, directors, and securities analysts (Belanger 2022). The average of these was considered the overall strength of a company's reputation for Cole’s model. This information was run through multiple iterations and refinements. Cole’s model suggests that company reputations accounted for close to 26% and 32% of the total market capitalisation of the S&P 500 and FTSE 250 respectively. The variation in reputation contribution is even higher between individual companies, with a high of almost 58% (Apple) to a low of –39% (Sears Holdings).

The average estimate was 63% of a firm's market value, but this was as low as 47% in the UK and Hong Kong, and as high as 76% in Brazil. On an individual firm level, about two-thirds of executives attributed over half their company’s value to their reputation and a third over three-quarters of its value. These figures are much higher than the estimates produced by reputation analysis, suggesting that executives might overvalue their company’s reputation.

Schurman (2004) argues that ‘industry structures confer particular strategic openings and closures on social movements and render firms and industries more or less vulnerable to social movement actions’ (Schurman 2004). These include broader structures of the whole industry, such as the level of competition in an industry. More competition incentivises companies to seek to enhance their market positions or maintain them by mimicking the capitulation of other firms. In a similar vein, industries in which brand name and/or reputation is important to competition should be more vulnerable to attack (Debora L. Spar 2008; Mac Sheoin 2014). These include industries with more concentrated pressure points in their commodity chain such as a small number of buyers, particularly if these buyers have weaker social and economic relationships with the suppliers. For example, if a country's retail market is dominated by four firms and the product targeted is only a minor motivation for consumers to shop at that retailer such as goats cheese. This allows them to dissociate from the primary target in response to a campaign, putting significant pressure on the target (Schurman 2004). ",43

In some farms, cages may be enriched, such as by providing mink with a nest box (European Commission, 2001). However, these additions are unlikely to prevent most welfare issues. Due to confinement and lack of activity, animals become frustrated and frequently exhibit stereotyped behaviors, like repetitively moving in a certain way for no apparent reason (Hansen, 1998). The proportion of animals that engage in fur-chewing, a behaviour indicative of poor welfare, varies depending on the farm and season. This ranges from less than 5% to more than 60% in a survey of Dutch mink farms,(Harris, 2015) and from less than 20% to more than 60% in a survey of Swedish mink farms(Olofsson and Lidfors, 2012) Confinement in mesh flooring in cages can also lead to sore hocks (ulcerative pododermatitis), which cause infections and abscesses. Research has shown that up to 40% of rabbits in one European country showed discomfort due to paw injuries (Drescher, 1996). Injury and disease can ultimately result in death. Pre-weaning mortality for mink in fur farms in Canada has been reported as around 20%,(Compo et al., 2017) while mortality between weaning and pelting was found to be around 1-2% in a Danish study, though this may not be representative of a typical fur farm since the study was performed on a research farm (De Rond and Van Willigen, 2012).",5

In Europe, mink are usually killed using CO or CO2. The minimum concentration of CO2 allowed by EU law for killing mink is 80%. This concentration of gas can take an average of 4-5 minutes to kill mink and there is evidence that mink find high levels of CO2 aversive (Harris, 2015). There are similar concerns about the time to death and aversiveness of CO when killing mink. A 2008 report from the working group to the Scientific Advisory Committee on Animal Health and Welfare in Ireland concluded that the use of CO2, or CO from filtered exhaust gases is not acceptable (Harris, 2015). Meanwhile, foxes are usually killed by electrocution while restrained with neck-tongs. When tested with sedated foxes, this method brought about an immediate and irreversible state of unconsciousness. However, animals are not sedated on fur farms, and there is potential for poor welfare if there is incorrect application of electrodes (Harris, 2015).",6

Beyond the country of origin, an important consideration for the welfare of frogs consumed in Switzerland is the percentage of these that are farmed versus wild-caught. The Federal Council does not track the origin of these frogs (Maya, 2009) so it is necessary to look at broader trends to estimate the farmed frog percentage. The FAO estimated that aquaculture has grown from 3% of the global frog market in 1980  to 15% in 2002, an increase of 500%(FAO, 2005) Given the similar trends we have seen in the broader aquaculture market over between 1990 and 2018 (a growth of 527%)(Food and Agriculture Organization, 2020), we expect that between 20-50% of frogs are now produced in aquaculture. However, these broader trends are not entirely applicable to Swiss frog imports as most Indonesian frogs are wild caught (Kusrini, 2005) and Indonesia alone makes up 88% of Swiss imports (Frog import origin Switzerland 2001-2006, 2021).",9

The Animal Welfare Institute describes a slightly different slaughter process, which appears to be equally cruel: “They are often skinned, and have their snouts and rear legs cut off with scissors or a blade while still alive. Their torsos are then tossed aside in a pile of other bleeding frogs and they endure a slow, agonizing death”(Animal Welfare Institute, 2011).",10

According to a Federal Council Opinion submitted in 2010, around 450,000 live frogs (mainly from Turkey) are imported into Switzerland each year (Maya, 2009). This suggests that about 10% of frogs consumed in Switzerland experience slaughter in-country rather than abroad. Owing to stronger Swiss regulations, this may inflict slightly less pain than slaughter methods abroad, though the welfare issues are still significant. For instance, there are no specific transport regulations for frogs, so they are only covered by general transport regulations. Frogs are usually cooled down before being beheaded, to comply with the Swiss requirement that vertebrates are anaesthetised before slaughter. However, it is not clear to what extent frogs lose consciousness during the cooling process, meaning that they may experience the slaughter process while still fully conscious. Occasionally, frogs are beheaded after an electrical stun. If the electrical stun is performed appropriately and full consciousness is lost, this may be a more humane slaughter method (Maya, 2009).",11

One source mentions that the techniques for collecting and harvesting frogs are the same as those used in capturing wild frogs. These methods include nets, hand capture, spearing, and fishing with a hook and line (Louis A. Helfrich, Richard J. Neves, James Parkhurst, 2009). However, in addition to these issues, farmed frogs must live in factory farming conditions for up to three years before they are slaughtered(Louis A. Helfrich, Richard J. Neves, James Parkhurst, 2009) Mortality on these farms is incredibly high at almost 50% (FAO, 2005). In an economic analysis, Henriques et al. (2013) found that this broke down into 20% mortality in the spawning phase, 10% as a tadpole, 35% in the imango phase, and 10% in the fattening phase (Moreira et al., 2013). However, it is unclear at what stage of their life cycle frogs gain consciousness, or what intensity of valenced experience is felt (Schukraft, 2020) at different stages of a frog’s life cycle. Broadly speaking, we should expect frogs to suffer from many of the same issues found in other factory aquaculture farms, including overcrowding, disease, poor water quality, and lack of enrichment (Warfield, 2018).

This is generally pellets composed of fly larvae (Musca domestica),(FAO, 2005) although frogs have a preference for live prey (agricfarming, 2020). Frogs given automatic feeders have been found to have feed conversion ratios of between 1.08-1.52 (Castro et al., 2017) and for frog legs 80% of the frog is then thrown away. From our cost-effectiveness analysis, we estimate that this would require about one million kilograms of feed which would use almost six billion fly larvae. Rethink Priorities provide a good overview of farming practices for these insects. In brief, they are typically raised in netted boxes in hot, humid conditions. They are fed food waste which they then burrow into, which can lead to early deaths if the temperature gets too high. They are harvested when fully grown and then shredded or freeze-dried for slaughter (Rowe, 2020).",13

An average of about 210,000 kg of foie gras has been imported into Switzerland over the past three years. This requires the death of 600,000 ducks and geese each year to meet demand. Roughly half of these are males who are stuffed before being slaughtered (so their livers can be sold for foie gras) and the other half are female chicks who are shredded or gassed shortly after hatching because their livers are not suitable for foie gras (Four Paws, 2020b). 85% of this is imported from France, with the rest coming from other EU countries including Hungary, Bulgaria, Belgium, Germany, and Italy.

The process involves giving ducks or geese a large quantity of feed through a tube that is put down the animal’s throat two to three times a day, for around 10 seconds each time (CIFOG, 2015). The amount of feed in each meal is considerably greater than any normal intake and is increased over the force-feeding period. Mortality during the force-feeding period is typically over 4% in geese and over 3% in ducks. This compares to a mortality rate of just 0.2% for age-matched, non-force-fed drakes (male ducks) (Skippon, 2013). The birds experience fear and distress during catching, restraint, and force-feeding. The swelling of the liver caused by the force-feeding also causes discomfort, more frequent injuries, and severely impaired movement (Compassion in World Farming, 2010).",16

However, generally they do not have access to a sufficient quantity of open water to allow them to perform much of their natural behaviour. During the force-feeding period, the birds are confined in pens or group cages. Ducks may be kept in individual cages that are so small that the birds cannot turn around, stand erect, or stretch their wings. The slatted or wire mesh floors of the cages can cause foot injuries, while the birds may be kept in near darkness during the force-feeding period, except when being fed (Compassion in World Farming, 2010). Once sufficiently fattened, ducks and geese are then slaughtered according to the country’s laws. In the EU, this usually involves stunning then bleeding, or neck dislocation with no stunning (Clarke, 2011).",17

A PETA investigation of an alligator farm in Texas found “alligators kept in fetid water and dank, dark sheds without sunshine, fresh air, clean water, or even basic medical care.” The investigator also witnessed some alligators being shot several times during slaughter and cut while still conscious (PETA, 2014).",21

The item likely to have the strongest support for an import ban is fur as ‘83% of Swiss consider it unjustifiable to keep and kill animals for fur for the fashion industry’(Fur free alliance, 2016) and a further ‘90% are in favor of an import ban for fur items, which are not produced according to the Swiss animal welfare standard’(Fur Free Alliance, 2016). Other controversial products such as foie gras also have majority public support for an import ban with 60% in favour of an import ban and 76% viewing it as cruelty to animals.(CDE, no date) This lower figure is likely due to a higher percentage of the population who consume foie gras (30%)(‘La réalité du foie gras en Suisse’, 2019) compared to fur. However, as expected, the level of support for a ban and consumption levels varied between language regions of the country. Fortunately, the consumption of foie gras, and therefore likely opposition to a ban on the product, is low in the majority of cantons. ",39

Some sources show that a slight majority (56%) of the Swiss population surveyed do not  view it as cruel to kill frogs to eat them (Bradley, 2014). For other cruel products in Switzerland, a similar proportion of the public tends to view the product as cruel to the proportion in favour of a ban or import ban. This suggests support for a ban would be around 44%. However, we are unable to gain access to the original survey so it is not clear if explanations were presented that could raise this number in a campaign, such as the legs being cut off while alive. The survey was also conducted prior to 2009 so public opinion may have changed since then. Another consideration is that we expect consumption and therefore support for a ban to differ between language regions. This means that a cantonal majority may be an additional barrier to success. Overall, a frog legs ban seems less likely to succeed on its own and will likely be the weakest element from a campaigns perspective.  ",40

A 2011 report ‘Canapés to Extinction’ laid out details about the world trade in frogs’ legs and the ecological impacts it has.(Sandra Altherr, Alejandra Goyenechea, D.J. Schubert, 2011) One obvious impact is a decline in the populations of certain species of frogs. One recent study found that the population of the Anatolian water frog was declining by 20% each year, warning that over-harvesting could wipe out frogs in parts of Turkey if capture is not reduced (Clare, 2020). Decline in frog populations also has knock-on effects on populations of insects, as they are able to multiply more easily. This can cause issues for farmers due to crop destruction and lead to the use of more pesticides (Osterath, 2017). The collapse of frog populations and a subsequent increase in agriculturally disruptive animal populations led India and Bangladesh to ban the export of frogs in the 1980s (Sandra Altherr, Alejandra Goyenechea, D.J. Schubert, 2011). A further issue is the potential for the spread of disease among frogs that are kept in cramped and unsanitary conditions after capture (Dalton, 2020).",41

However, we can make some weak inferences from their farming alongside products such as fur and the actions of big retail brands. Here we can see various luxury brands have already dropped exotic leathers and down from their supply chains after pressure from PETA (Chua, 2020; Uk, 2020). These commitments tend to be framed alongside fur or as a logical next step to removing fur (BBC, 2019; The New York Times, 2020; Conti, 2021). Though we can be far less confident in the level of public support than for other products, the broad impression from retailers and the media suggests public opposition to exotic leather and down is likely somewhere between the opposition to fur and frogs.

For instance, 88% of the British public view cages as cruel to farm animals,(Compassion in World Farming, 2020) a finding we expect to generalise to the Swiss context. There is also the widely successful End the Cage Age campaign which successfully acquired around 1.4 million signatures, resulting in the European Commission agreeing to phase out cages for farmed animals across Europe (CIWF, 2021).

They typically suggest that product declaration and proper labelling should be used instead (Lukas, 2019). Indeed, a paper published in 2006 states that import tariffs or bans for animal welfare reasons conflict with WTO rules (principally because trade law considers two animal products which are identical in their finished form to be ‘like products’, even if they were made using different production methods) (Grethe, 2007).

Some products such as shark fins, live-plucked down, and exotic leather are imported in low enough quantities that the combined effect of a ban on these products makes up less than 1% of the value of a cruel products ban. Other products, such as frogs’ legs, fur, caged eggs, and foie gras make up 73%, 10%, 13%, and 3% respectively.  This makes the inclusion of some products in the import ban much higher priority than others. Another element the cost-effectiveness analysis highlighted is the importance of flow-through effects for different products. For example, frogs’ legs would have a large direct impact given the number of frogs that are imported, while also reducing the number of insects used in their feed. The sheer number of insects involved (~6 billion), means that this effect has the potential to dwarf most other products, depending on one's views on the importance of insects and their welfare during farming. Some areas that could improve this cost-effectiveness analysis include a more in-depth examination of how demand for the by-products of other industries, such as leather or cheese trimmings, affect the production of the main product and modelling the effect of price changes on supply and demand. These effects have been ignored or modelled only simply as we do not expect additional research into these areas to significantly affect the value of the import ban.",70

Therefore, they claim that implementing such an import ban would be practically impossible. However, for some items such as frogs’ legs or shark fins, enforcement would be significantly easier than the Federal Council has previously suggested since all examples of these products can be considered cruel. Previous instances of such bans, such as on seal products or the ban on cat fur, are examples of enforcement on individual products being largely successful. For other products, analysis of previous instances of lower welfare bans or tariffs would be beneficial (such as the EU-Mercosur trade agreement which has successfully placed conditional tariffs on egg imports that are not raised to EU standards would be beneficial) (Busby, 2019).",73

To rectify this issue, the process of determining cost of compliance and equivalence requirements must be allocated to an institution independent from producer interests. Another issue comes in the determination of equivalence, since it is difficult to unambiguously assess different husbandry systems with respect to their degree of animal friendliness. For example, a production system may be superior to Swiss standards on one metric (e.g. space) but inferior on another (e.g. provision of enrichment). Therefore, any system of enforcement needs to be limited to significant differences in animal welfare standards for which some consensus can be reached. The report points to international organic certification standards as an example of how a ‘process standard’ can work across borders.  In Europe, the report found compliance with these standards is ascertained at a relatively low cost, usually less than 1% of product value (Grethe, 2007).",74

For foie gras, 38% of consumers indicated willingness to travel to France or elsewhere to circumnavigate the ban (‘La réalité du foie gras en Suisse’, 2019). Given the lack of information available for other cruel products, we should take this as a rough prior for the percentage of consumers who would travel abroad for less frequently purchased luxury products. However, for items such as fur, exotic leather, and live-plucked down, faux or replacement products are more difficult to distinguish from the genuine product. One would expect this to reduce the desire to travel abroad for the real product. Again, there are also reasons to expect caged eggs to differ significantly, as consumers are typically willing to pay more for cage-free vs caged eggs (Lusk, 2019) and the two products are virtually identical. This means cross-border shopping will be largely determined by the potential cost savings of doing so (Leal, López-Laborda and Rodrigo, 2010). Therefore, we expect a greatly reduced motivation for cross-border shopping for these goods.",75

The arguments that would be most persuasive in encouraging people to divest from animal agriculture highlight its environmental impact. This is also currently the most widely-used argument encouraging people to divest from animal agriculture. However, this framing could pose an animal welfare problem. The farming of large animals, especially cows, has a much larger environmental impact than the farming of smaller animals. Therefore, a divestment campaign that was not careful to avoid this might well disproportionately affect the farming of large animals. This in turn risks shifting consumption to smaller animals, increasing the total number of animals farmed for food, since many more small animals must be raised to produce the same amount of meat as a large animal.",13

Debt financing is particularly important because it provides more cashflow to most companies than equity (Gan, 2019). For the oil and gas sector, it is estimated that debt financing provides 9.5 times as much financing as equities (CNN, no date). The market for debt financing centres on a small number of large banks (amounting to 40% of the market) and is generally less liquid (less trading is done) than equity financing (Ansar, Caldecott and Tilbury, 2013; Quigley, Bugden and Odgers, 2020).

However, when discussing alternative approaches for achieving stigmatisation available to the animal advocacy movement, they generally agreed that there was nothing particularly special about divestment for achieving this effect. Instead, other vegan outreach, undercover investigations, or corporate campaigns could achieve similar effects. The exception came from those more familiar with maximising media coverage, an important step to achieving stigmatisation. They thought that financial news outlets would be more likely to cover divestment announcements than the wider media would cover any other campaigns. One expert outlined the mechanisms they had used to maximise the stigmatisation effect of an institution they convinced to divest, explaining that similar institutions achieved much less media coverage even when they were as or more trusted.

Moreover, there is evidence that the direct effects from divestment on the cost of capital are minimal.

Within animal advocacy, there are already existing campaign types that involve the stigmatisation process but have stronger direct effects. The stigmatisation process does appear to cause real harm to the industry, but unlike in other cases like apartheid-era South Africa, there are other ways of achieving this in relation to animal agriculture.

More so than in other divestment movements, there is some risk of divestment from animal agriculture causing harm. This is because companies that farm larger animals will likely be more damaged by environmental arguments used to achieve divestment.

This reduces the host's appetite and growth, increases stress (Bowers et al. 2000; Ross et al. 2000), and causes external wounds. All of these factors reduce the vitality of the salmon, making them more vulnerable to infections and disease (Abolofia, Asche, and Wilen 2017). Therefore, although sea lice themselves are unlikely to directly cause the death of the fish, they compromise its immune function, potentially indirectly leading to its death. The more severe the sea lice infestation, the greater the compromise in the function and welfare of the host - ultimately leading to higher mortality rates (Vollset 2019; Morton 2005). These consequences can be sufficiently extreme that moderate to severe sea lice infestations would probably factor as the dominant cause of suffering in those salmon afflicted and sufficient to make their lives not worth living.

While cleaner fish are also commonly used, these will be covered in a different section. One common method of sea lice removal is the thermolicer, a heat-based treatment⁶. This machine pumps salmon through a system that exposes them to 30-34C water, removing the lice. The process lasts about 30 seconds before the salmon are pumped back into their pens (SSPO n.d.). Other than the thermolicer, other treatments include the Optilicer (thermal) and Hydrolicer (mechanical). From information reported by Scottish farms about sea lice and the treatments used, we can establish that between 29/03/2021 and the date of writing this (28/05/2021), 34 mitigation measures were put in place to deal with sea lice. Of these, nine involved the use of a physical treatment (usually reported as the hydrolicer, although it is not clear if some of these were also thermolicers). This implies that roughly a quarter of responses to sea lice involve physical/thermal treatments. The rest of the measures were reported as bath only (6), bath and harvesting (3), cleaner fish only (6), cleaner fish and harvesting (3), or harvesting only (7) (FHI 2021). ",40

These are fish that have an extra set of chromosomes, achieved by applying a heat or pressure shock on newly fertilised eggs. This means triploid fish are sterile and so cannot interbreed with the wild population. However, triploid salmon have been shown to have reduced welfare compared to normal diploid salmon. One study found that triploid salmon have an increased prevalence of spinal deformities (between 2-3% are deformed, compared to 0-1% of diploid salmon) (Fjelldal and Hansen 2010). Triploids are also more vulnerable to temperature stress, though they may also be less aggressive (Fraser et al. 2012). They can also have a higher mortality rate than diploids (Cotter et al. 2002; Benfey 2001).

The interaction between stocking density and welfare is a complex one since stocking density can have knock-on effects on other parameters, such as water quality and spread of disease. One study examined welfare indicators in Atlantic salmon in cages on a commercial marine farm, at densities ranging from 9.7 to 34 kg/m3. The authors found that stocking density did not affect welfare up to an inflection point of 22 kg/m3, at which point welfare then began to deteriorate (Turnbull et al. 2005). Another study examined salmon welfare at 15, 25, and 35 kg/m3. This study found that welfare was best at 25 kg/m3, suggesting that welfare can also be compromised at lower densities (Adams et al. 2007). ",95

There have been attempts to directly improve the quality of the water in cages, most notably with dissolved oxygen (Berillis et al. 2016).

The composition of their diet varies throughout their life stages, with younger freshwater salmon eating more insects while adult salmon subsist on other marine animals. In aquaculture, salmon feed is carefully formulated for each life stage by varying protein, lipid, and nutrient content (“FAO: Feed Production” n.d.). This provides the salmon with the nutrients they need to grow and develop into the next stage. The ingredient composition used to achieve these goals has changed in recent decades. One recent study has produced estimates of the ingredients used in salmon feed in Norway (Aas, Ytrestøyl, and Åsgård 2019). In the figure below you can see the general trend, with the percentage of marine oil and protein sources reducing dramatically over the past 30 years. Although this data is from Norwegian salmon farms we expect this to generalise to the Scottish context.",172

The most straightforward benefit this has to wild fish is sparing them the experience of capture and slaughter. As there are no protections for wild-caught fish, this is usually a very stressful process culminating in death by asphyxiation - a process that can take more than 30 minutes for some species. This is likely to be one of the worst ways to die as a fish. However, it is important to consider the counterfactual cause of death for the fish if they had not been caught. They could die of starvation, disease, or predation, all of which are unpleasant ways to die. Beyond this effect, there are additional considerations about the effect of fishing on wild populations. If the industry is overfishing, reducing demand for wild-caught fish could increase wild fish populations. The quality of a wild fish’s life, as well as the effect of this population change on the rest of the food chain, could dramatically change the positive or negative direction of this effect, without even considering any other ethical considerations beyond utilitarianism. This means that modelling the benefit of reducing marine ingredient use to wild fish populations is complicated and something we can’t achieve in the short review here. ",174

If managed properly, the growth of the salmon will be unaffected. However, if too little is used this could be detrimental for productivity, and more importantly the health and welfare of the fish. Some compositions can cause differences in growth rates even at higher percentages of fish meal. Bransden et al. (2001) compared the effect of replacing some of the fishmeal in their diet with dehulled lupin meal (LPN), hydrolysed poultry feather meal (FTH), or a mix of both for salmon. All feed mixes had fishmeal contents above 30%. They found that the highest weight gain was achieved on the mixed or conventional fish meal diet. Importantly for the welfare of the salmon, they found no difference in immune function between the diets (Bransden, Carter, and Nowak 2001). Pratoomyot et al. (2010) examined four diets consisting of gradually lower fish meal contents at lower marine ingredient usages closer to what we currently see used in Norway and likely in Scottish salmon aquaculture. In the study, they replaced fish meal with plant protein in diets containing compositions of 25%, 18%, 11%, and 5% fish meal. They found that with each reduction in fish meal content, there was a reduction in the growth rate of the fish. The authors suggest this was due to the decreased palatability of these compositions to the salmon (Pratoomyot et al. 2010). However, at these lower levels it appears that supplementation with fish protein hydrolysate can offset the negative effects on growth - such as with 10% supplementation when reducing fish meal content from 35% to 5% (Egerton et al. 2020).

Given that the industry has already reduced its fish meal usage significantly, additional improvement is likely to be more difficult and may occur on its own regardless of any additional guidance or legislation.

One of the biggest concerns is that, with a reduction in the potential for disease and an increase in control over water quality, farmers could increase their stocking densities. This would mean that salmon would suffer from an even greater reduction in living space and the likely stress and aggression that would accompany this. Existing certification schemes may mitigate this threat. Furthermore, closed containment systems require water to be continuously moving in one direction. This means that salmon that are ill cannot rest as they are pulled by the water movement. Another concern raised by Compassion in World Farming is that these systems will be completely reliant on the continuous operation of powered machinery and any backup systems. This means that any lapse in power supply, or human error, can have catastrophic consequences for the salmon. An example of this occurred in 2019 when 1.5 million juvenile salmon died at a hatchery⁹ owned by Mowi Scotland Ltd because of a human error that resulted in the recirculation pump stopping (CIWF 2021). Still, this risk may be acceptable given the other benefits of the system. ",191

Each of these could potentially significantly improve the quality of life for any fish who benefits from them.

Sea lice data from Marine Scotland shows that monthly average sea lice levels exceeded six per fish 17 times, and two per fish 472 times, on farms between 2018 and 2020 (“Sea Lice Count Data 2018-2020 - Historical Sea Lice Data for Scottish Salmon Aquaculture 2010 - 2020” n.d., “Sea Lice Count Data - 2018-2020” n.d.).

No advisory notices were sent in 2018 but 8 breaches were recorded which would require enforcement notices (“Fish Health Inspectorate: Sea Lice Information” n.d.).

This is also an important thing to consider as these schemes already exceed existing regulation and the CoGP in many areas. This means that compliance here will reduce the number of animals affected by an improvement in regulations. The RSPCA assurance scheme is the most widely subscribed to scheme in UK aquaculture, with around 70% of Scottish salmon certified (“What Is RSPCA Assured?” n.d.). The RSPCA provides statistics about their regular assessments of farms: ‘Of the 3,173 assessments completed in 2019, 44% had one or more non-compliances recorded. The vast majority of those were very minor, however 17 (0.5%) had severe animal welfare related non-compliances which resulted in immediate suspension from the scheme and subsequent investigation.’ (“RSPCA Assured Annual Review 2019” n.d.) The average number of infractions was 2.3 per assessment but, given that the RSPCA have 368 standards per species on average, this is a small proportion.

Another source tells us that rainbow trout are often harvested at between 1.5 and 5 kg (Seafish n.d.). Assuming an average harvest weight of 3kg, this would mean that approximately 2.5 million rainbow trout were raised that year. If we assume a lower average weight of 1.5kg, this would be 5 million individuals.

The current state of fish welfare in Scotland suggests that the Scottish Government must step in to improve standards. Creating a new official Code of Practice would be one step towards doing so. However, the fact that over 70% of Scottish salmon farms are accredited to the RSPCA or the Soil Association Organic standards - which often go beyond legal requirements - makes us more sceptical of the impact that an official Code of Practice might have for many of these problems. This concern is especially strong if the official Code of Practice were to contain a lot of vague or ineffectual guidance, as is currently the case with the industry CoGP.

Uganda currently has a mix of intensive, semi-intensive, and free range farming (more details below). Intensive and semi-intensive farming have been predicted to grow substantially as Uganda develops. This would cause many more animals to suffer, and it could cause animal welfare to deteriorate. This ask would involve advocating for the government to prevent the growth of intensive and semi-intensive farming, and to instead favour extensive and/or free-range farming. This ask would improve the lives of numerous animals in the short-term and in the long-term, and it would provide critical information for animal advocates in other developing countries. This ask would also allow Uganda to avoid many of the public health and environmental problems that have been caused by intensive farming in other countries.

Umbrella animal welfare regulations. Many countries have legally binding regulations that improve animal welfare on farms and ban farming practices that cause animals extreme suffering. This ask would involve advocating for the government to establish a similar set of legally binding regulations in Uganda, possibly building on the draft standards that do exist in Uganda. This would improve the lives of numerous animals now, allow animal welfare standards to become stronger over time, and provide legitimacy for future animal welfare campaigns.

Fish welfare improvements. Fish are the most numerous group of farmed animals in Uganda. Intensive, commercial-scale fish production is growing in Uganda, and this type of production typically causes fish to suffer throughout their lives. This ask would seek to improve the lives of farmed fish. Specifically, this ask could be achieved by: campaigning for the government to establish an overarching fish welfare standard; working with farmers to improve fish welfare on farms; and strengthening biosecurity and disease prevention policy.

Chicken welfare improvements. Chicken are the second most numerous group of farmed animals in Uganda. Intensive, commercial-scale chicken production also causes chickens to suffer throughout their lives, and this type of production is expected to expand in Uganda. This ask would seek to improve the lives of farmed chickens.

The specifics of the policy would determine which exact practices are banned or prevented. In contrast, extensive animal farming involves natural environments, where animals can express natural behaviours, such as exploration, grazing, and exercise (20).

Firstly, farmed animals would likely experience conditions that are better for their welfare. Intensive animal farming involves confining animals in large, densely populated buildings. This usually stops animals from experiencing freedoms and natural behaviours that are essential for their welfare, and there are many specific harms involved with industrial production systems (e.g. painful mutilations or health problems caused by using fast-growing breeds) (24,25). Indeed, the major animal welfare campaigns currently taking place in developed countries focus on phasing out the worst practices of industrialised farming, like keeping hens in cages (26).

Likewise, there are 43 million chickens being farmed in Uganda, almost half of which are farmed in semi-intensive or intensive systems (5). The FAO predicts that there could be up to 187 million chickens farmed for meat by 2050, compared to 37 million today (not including layer hens), with up to 90% in semi-intensive or intensive production (compared to 45% today) (5).

Fish are highly neglected by animal advocacy organisations in Africa, almost all of which focus on land animals (33). This would suggest that advocating for farmed fish may have a particularly large impact - there may be some policies that could improve fish welfare for relatively little effort, simply because fish welfare has not received attention in Uganda. Likewise, the first organisation to conduct work on fish welfare in Uganda could inspire other organisations, policymakers, and farmers to give this issue greater attention, thereby increasing the impact of a campaign even more. However, there is basically no precedent for work on farmed fish welfare in Uganda, which might make a fish welfare campaign less likely to succeed. As we have illustrated in the flow chart at the beginning of this report, the key question is whether policymakers, fish farmers, and other stakeholders would consider taking measures to improve fish welfare. This is not a question we can resolve through our own research. So, if you are looking to carry out an animal advocacy campaign in Uganda, a wise first step would be to conduct some initial scoping research to answer this question (and the others in the flow chart at the beginning of this report). This could involve speaking with policymakers and fish farmers to develop a sense of whether these people are willing to consider policies that improve fish welfare.",50

This is discussed in detail above, and many of those strategies also apply here - this campaign would simply narrow the focus to fish, rather than including other animals. This campaign would involve identifying the major welfare problems experienced by farmed fish in Uganda, then campaigning for the government to implement an overarching regulation or other policy to address these welfare problems. A regulation would involve a collection of welfare considerations, perhaps covering water quality, space requirements and stocking density, feed composition, stunning and slaughter, and environmental enrichment (29). A broad regulation like this would enable the campaign to improve the lives of fish, even if the evidence is murky for any one welfare consideration.

Assisting farmers with farmed fish welfare. In principle, this is similar to an overarching regulation for farmed fish welfare, except with a stronger emphasis on direct work with farmers rather than government lobbying. For example, this campaign could involve building relationships with farmers and then working with those farmers to improve fish welfare standards on farms. Improving fish health and welfare would improve growth and survival and reduce problems like disease and stunted growth (32,34), which could encourage farmers to participate in this programme. Work very similar to this is being conducted by Fish Welfare Initiative in India and the Philippines, which could provide useful lessons to help begin this work in Uganda. This campaign could also build support for fish welfare among farmers, which could lay the groundwork for future policy lobbying campaigns.

Improving fish biosecurity policy. Preventing and controlling diseases can prevent both unnecessary suffering in fish and financial losses to farmers. Uganda's policies for fish biosecurity do not include sufficient provisions for disease control and management (4). There are significant biosecurity lapses in regulatory frameworks and in practices on fish farm (4,16). As commercial-scale aquaculture expands, mass mortalities are becoming more common (4). This campaign would involve strengthening the regulatory frameworks for fish biosecurity and disease control and providing farmers with the knowledge and tools necessary to improve on-farm practices.",53

However, the top welfare improvements are likely to include choice of breed (avoiding fast-growing breeds), stocking density, litter quality, environmental enrichment, and stunning and slaughter. Other factors that could also be improved include air quality, lighting, and outdoor access. For layer hens, regulations would likely focus on banning cages, reducing stocking density, providing environmental enrichment, and improving feed quality.

Another option is to work directly with farmers. This campaign would be most effective if it focuses on the largest farms -  particularly those transitioning to, or expanding, intensive production - rather than smallholders with only a few chickens. This work would encourage farmers to implement some of the specific welfare improvements (listed in the dot point above) by pointing out how these improvements can also benefit broiler health and productivity. (Some improvements, like slower-growing breeds, would not benefit productivity.) Working with farmers would build support for higher-welfare farming systems and would therefore be a useful tactic towards achieving broader regulations.

Ensure industrialisation is focused on higher-welfare systems. This intervention would require close coordination with large-scale investors and banks to influence the development and intensification of the broiler industry. One type of this campaign involves working with shareholders - 'shareholder activism' is discussed in detail in this article, and it seems like a promising approach for advocacy. The aim would be to direct investment or require that investments are only made to farms that plan to adopt higher welfare practices, such as those outlined above. The poultry sector in Uganda appears to be constrained by insufficient capital investment (36). This suggests that attaching welfare conditions to investments and loans would indeed encourage farmers to follow those welfare conditions. If successful, this could influence the development of the poultry sector in a direction that involves higher animal welfare from the beginning. This could also make future calls for welfare regulations more likely to be successful. For this campaign, it is important not to accidentally encourage any additional capital investment or loans in the poultry sector, as this could inadvertently cause poultry farming to expand; rather, the campaign should focus on attaching welfare conditions to investments and loans that would have been made anyway.",66

This type of campaign is highly scalable, and the necessary talent is available (37). Public/individual outreach can build support for animal advocacy in Africa, possibly making institutional campaigns (like government outreach) easier in the future. This campaign type might risk causing negative reactions among the public (37), though we do not think that this risk is high.

Direct help involves providing direct, on-the-ground assistance to animals themselves, such as by conducting vaccination programmes or installing stunning equipment in slaughterhouses. Direct help is generally weaker across multiple measures, though it does have a lower risk of causing no or negative impact (37).

Capacity building involves building the skills, abilities, and resources of farmers, veterinarians, and other community members to better understand and support animal welfare. Capacity building is generally weaker across multiple measures, and it is particularly difficult to measure its success (37). For Uganda specifically, research by the Animal Welfare Competence Centre for Africa found that there has been a programme aiming to build animal welfare capacity among veterinary inspectors and veterinary officers. This programme, led by Bam Animal Clinics, has reached more than 200 professionals, but the overall impact on animal welfare has been limited. This suggests that capacity building campaigns targeting veterinarians in Uganda would need to first require an understanding of why previous campaigns have been unsuccessful. Campaigns targeting other community members, like farmers, could still be promising.",72

However, this type of campaign depends on leveraging public opinion to place pressure on large-scale, industrial producers and farmers. Public support for animal welfare campaigns is a little lower in African countries than in the developed countries where producer pressure campaigns have been successful (38). For this reason, producer pressure campaigns are unlikely to work well in Uganda.

Retailer/food service outreach involves campaigning for retailers (e.g. markets) and food service providers (e.g. restaurants and hotels) to only sell food produced to high welfare standards. This type of campaign has been successful in developed countries (39). However, this campaign depends on a relatively concentrated retail sector, with a small number of companies each controlling large volumes of trade. As such, this type of campaign is poorly suited to Uganda, where most farmed animals are either consumed by the family that raised them or sold locally on informal markets (5). As an exception, many farmed fish (particularly those farmed in large-scale, commercial operations) are exported to neighbouring countries like Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, and South Sudan (4,16). It could be possible to campaign for retailers in those countries to adopt higher welfare standards for these farmed fish, though the advocacy work necessary for this campaign would need to take place in those countries, rather than in Uganda. This campaign would be more likely to succeed if any of those countries had concentrated retail sectors, ideally with a few large retailers in tight competition with each other, as this dynamic encourages retailers to adopt animal welfare standards for their products.

Certifier campaign is similar to retailer/food service outreach, except that companies are asked to adopt welfare certification schemes. The certification schemes may also be pressured to improve their animal welfare standards, if necessary. This type of campaign is poorly suited to Uganda for the same reason as retailer/food service outreach.",74

Reducing antimicrobial resistance. The Strategic Plan also recognises the links between animal health and antimicrobial resistance (44). Animals with higher welfare can be raised with fewer antibiotics, thereby reducing the risk of antimicrobial resistance and improving community health (31,42).

Increasing food safety. When animals harbour harmful bacteria like Salmonella and Campylobacter, people who eat the animals' meat can become sick. Healthier, less stressed animals are less likely to harbour these bacteria. This improves food safety and people's health (40,42,44).

This report seems to be one of the major drivers behind the push to pass a new unified fisheries regulation bill by the end of 2023. The FAO is also one of the main authors of the proposed fisheries bill: “A team of legal experts from the legal division of the attorney general’s office and the FAO’s legal division will assist in collecting views and compiling the draft bill, prior to validation by the stakeholders” (12).

The second ask is to advocate for the bill to require fish welfare training. Specifically, it would be good for the bill to require people who handle and slaughter fish to undergo training in humane handling and fish welfare indicators. The training could involve consultation with aquaculture training institutes and educators, or online courses (e.g. the welfare indicator model here). In the interests of not imposing additional burdens on smallholder farmers, much of the welfare impact of this ask could be preserved by requiring training only for farms that produce more than a particular volume of fish. Even if training is only required for LHA staff, the ask would still retain much of its welfare impact.

Due to the variety of welfare needs associated with tilapia at different life-stages and in different production systems, a single density requirement is not appropriate. The stocking density goals for pond and cage systems used by Pedrazzani et al (16) are a good starting point. However, before trying to introduce these as benchmarks for Zimbabwean producers, further consultation with experts in Zimbabwean production systems or tilapia welfare would be beneficial. Additionally, because of the centralization of the industry in cage systems with Lake Harvest and the difficulty of enforcing regulations on informal pond systems, starting with regulations on cage systems could be sensible.

The second ask relevant to both cage and pond production systems would be limiting the amount of time fish can spend out of water before slaughter or stunning. The shorter this time, the better as fish are asphyxiating and otherwise greatly suffering while out of water. Moreover, it has not been established that putting fish on ice in these cases solves this problem, indeed it may make it worse (18). However, in the interests of feasibility, the specific time limits would have to be partly determined by how easy compliance would be for producers.",32

Environmental enrichment in ponds. The most important aspect of environmental enrichment is the provision of substrate in artificial ponds.

Industrialised animal farming uses intensive production methods like battery cages and gestation crates, and this system is generally designed to maximise profits and minimise costs (1). The specifics of the policy would determine which exact practices are banned or prevented. In contrast, extensive animal farming involves natural environments, where animals can  express natural behaviours, such as exploration, grazing, and exercise (2). The pastoral and free-range systems that are used by small-scale households in Zimbabwe are examples of extensive production systems.",40

This could help the government avoid the public health and environmental problems that have been caused by industrialised animal farming in developed countries (see Appendix 2: Animal Welfare and One Health).

Likewise, this could enable the government to position themselves as a leader in sustainable agricultural policy on both the regional and global stage, especially considering the progress being made on animal welfare on the level of the African Union (3,4).",41

Intensive animal farming involves confining animals in large, densely populated buildings. This usually stops animals from experiencing freedoms and natural behaviours that are essential for their welfare, and there are many specific harms involved with industrial production systems (e.g. painful mutilations, health problems caused by using fast-growing breeds) (5,6). Indeed, the major animal welfare campaigns currently taking place in developed countries focus on phasing out the worst practices of industrialised farming, like keeping hens in cages (7). If Zimbabwe did not pursue intensive animal farming, and instead favoured extensive or free-range farming, then the conditions that cause immense suffering to animals would be averted.

Secondly, this campaign in Zimbabwe would be extremely valuable for animal advocates in other developing countries. If this campaign is successful in Zimbabwe, then it would be a watershed moment - the campaign could be replicated in other countries around the world, magnifying its impact substantially and improving the lives of hundreds of millions or even billions of animals worldwide.

Thirdly, there may be fewer animals farmed overall. Industrialised farming systems were developed to farm a very large number of animals very cheaply. Extensive or free-range farming would produce a smaller number of animals, which could mean that fewer animals are born into lives of suffering. This would depend on whether Zimbabweans' demand for meat remains relatively low, or whether the demand increases but is met by free-range production or even imports from other countries. ",43

Framing this policy in terms of win-wins will be critical to attracting the support of government and other stakeholders. These win-win options include overlaps between animal welfare objectives and objectives around environmental concerns, human health, economic profitability, food security, and employment. The One Health concept captures some of these overlaps, and Zimbabwean stakeholder’s familiarity with the concept makes it an excellent frame for promoting these win-win options in conversation with policymakers. The following paragraphs will identify a number of these overlaps.",52

If Zimbabwe wants to target export markets that have stricter regulations on animal product imports, then domestic producers have an incentive to meet these regulations. These regulations can either directly require certain standards of animal welfare from producers, or indirectly benefit animals by requiring the products to be disease-free. While regional African export markets may have less strict regulations, if stakeholders eventually want to target wealthier export markets they have an incentive to eventually bring their production standards in line with these more demanding import regulations. 

A good example of these economic incentives leading to improved animal welfare outcomes is the Farm Assured Namibian Meat scheme. If stakeholders within a particular industry have exports to stricter markets as a medium or long-term goal, they may be receptive to piloting higher welfare production methods as early trials, or simply requiring higher-welfare production methods from the beginning.

At smaller scales, it seems plausible that many of the gains in productivity associated with larger-scale, more intensive production may actually be a result of the improved market access available to larger firms. This suggests that many of the economic goals that push producers to larger-scale, more intensive production can actually be met by programs that improve the market access of small-scale producers. Since smaller producers are also often better from an environmental and public health perspective, improving the market access of small producers can satisfy a number of overlapping goals. Snyder et al. (2020) (8) and a report by UNIDO analysing Tanzania red meat value chain (9) make a convincing case that this model is true in Tanzania:

Other overlaps between animal welfare and other goals are often more specific to particular contexts and particular stakeholders. These can include a focus on the negative environmental or land-use effects of intensive animal agriculture, the increased risks of zoonotic diseases, or the improvements in food security smallholder farming with indigenous breeds can often provide. If there are stakeholders such as NGOs whose goals align with these, collaborating with these organisations can be a win-win option for both animal welfare and other goals. ",53

Create a new animal welfare team, under the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate.

Cover the major welfare problems experienced by farmed animals.

This reflects a failure to respond to scientific information about the sentience of animals and increased moral awareness of their welfare, since the writing of this Act over 60 years ago and its last update 20 years ago.

Invertebrates are also excluded from the Act, meaning that the farmed bee population in Zimbabwe has no protection. This is despite many recent studies strongly suggesting that bees can feel pain, meaning that we are responsible for the welfare of bees under our care (45).

The Act lacks specificity. For example, the Act establishes that an offence occurs when somebody “cruelly or unnecessarily ties up or confines any animal or causes or permits any animal to be tied up or confined”. While this seems reasonable on the face of it, “cruelty” is not defined. Anyone wishing to excuse their own behaviour or the behaviour of others could interpret the term in a narrow light. Adding more specificity makes it harder for people to rationalise bad behaviour as meeting the standard set in the Act.

Further, “confined” is not defined or elaborated on in the act. A reasonable interpretation of this might prohibit some specific practices, including perhaps the use of cages for egg-laying hens, but there is no further elaboration in the Act. Greater specificity could resolve these ambiguities and lead to higher welfare on farms.

Greater specificity is often achieved through the writing of codes of practices for the major groups of animals used in a particular country. Zimbabwe does not have any codes of regular codes of practice for animals, and the development of these codes should be a legislative aspiration for the country. We see this as the most important legislative goal for animal welfare in Zimbabwe.",88

Reducing environmental problems. Better husbandry systems are more productive. This means that fewer resources like feed and water are wasted and that fewer environmental pollutants are released into the atmosphere and the water. This reduces environmental problems (51).",98

The on-growing stage involves growing the fish to around 250 - 350 g on freshwater farms. A small number are subsequently grown further, to around 3 - 4 kg, on sea farms.

The harvest stage involves slaughter and sale. Around 100 million fish are harvested from freshwater farms each year, and around 3 million from sea farms. Stunning and slaughter are not regulated, but the industry voluntarily stuns 70% of fish before slaughter, so stunning and slaughter may also be less of a priority. Around 80 - 90% of fish are exported, mostly to other European countries and to Asia. Only around 10 - 20% of fish are consumed domestically.

Legislative lobbying involves working with policymakers, such as politicians and ministry employees and politicians, to establish new, legally-binding welfare standards. This type of campaign can be cost-effective, as it is possible to communicate with policymakers and establish impactful policies with a relatively small team. Furthermore, producers that adopt voluntary standards often have an incentive to advocate for those standards to become legally binding (10,25) - since there is already a lot of interest in voluntary standards in Denmark (e.g. ASC), it is possible that there is already some sufficient industry support for stronger legal regulations.",71

For example, this could involve developing a new industry code of practice with the cooperation of the industry. This approach may not be well-suited to Denmark - it has tended to work best in contexts where farmers are being inefficient in some way (e.g. Indian carp farms), which is not the case in Denmark. In Denmark, this type of campaign has one advantage: most trout are produced by only a small number of enterprises, so targeting just the biggest few producers could benefit a large number of animals (see above, 'Most trout are produced by a small number of farms'). Also, these large farms would have greater financial and technical ability to implement new practices. The challenge with producer outreach would be getting industry stakeholders to agree on meaningful welfare improvements that improve on existing standards (e.g. ASC standards).

Corporate campaigns, which involve campaigning for retailers (e.g. supermarkets) and food service providers (e.g. restaurants and hotels) to only sell food produced to high welfare standards. This type of campaign depends on leveraging public opinion to place pressure on retailers, who in turn choose to supply only higher-welfare products. The biggest weakness of this approach is that it would probably conflict with the Better Chicken Commitment (BCC) campaign in Denmark - since the BCC involves corporate campaigns, this would mean that the BCC and this campaign share many of the same target retailers. Retailers may be less keen to meet with animal advocacy groups about multiple welfare asks at the same time and will struggle with the workload to transition multiple supply chains at the same time. On the other hand, retailers of Danish trout have already demonstrated a willingness to sell products of higher ethical standards - this might mean that further corporate campaigns targeting retailers of Danish trout are tractable. Certification schemes provide an existing collection of higher-welfare practices that are bundled into a collection. Many major retailers of Danish trout already appear to have adopted certification schemes, and about half of Danish trout production is certified by ASC (see above, 'Certification schemes'). We do believe that there is room for encouraging retailers to select more welfare-friendly certification schemes (see above, 'Smaller campaigns').",73

An electrical stunning machine (e.g. manufactured by Ace Aquatec) costs around 100,000 EUR (740,000 DKK).

Consumers would probably not switch from large-size trout to small-size trout as large- and small-size trout are perceived as different products. On the fish market, consumers' substitution between different fish products appears to be based on characteristics like flesh and processing rather than the species of the fish (24). Sea farms produce large-size trout with pink flesh, and these large-size trout are generally used for smoking or sold fresh (18). In contrast, freshwater trout farms produce portion trout with mostly white flesh, and these portion trout can be sold whole, sold as fillets, or used for smoking (18,44). (Note that most of Denmark's trout are exported to other countries, like Germany and other countries in Europe and Asia.) Shutting down sea farms would reduce the amount of large-size trout on the market. Since portion trout and large-size trout are considered different products, we expect that consumers would not substitute toward portion trout. Rather, we expect that consumers could substitute toward products like salmon, which are a similar product to large-size trout (pink flesh, large-sized, and sold whole or smoked) (45). It has been shown in both the German and Japanese fish markets that large-size trout compete with salmon (44,45).

The import or export of shark fin products was also recently banned in the UK and the practice of removing the fins from live sharks has been banned in UK waters for some time (DEFRA, 2021b). The main reason for this ban seems to have been conservation, but note that the animal welfare minister, Lord Goldsmith, also defends the ban on the grounds that the practice is “indescribably cruel and causes thousands of shark to die terrible deaths” (DEFRA, 2021b).

Passive methods including hanging nets, hook and line fishing, and traps make up the remaining 13% (Marine Management Organization, 2020).

The oxygen debt incurred by this worsens the asphyxiation that fish are subject to when brought on board (Mike Breen, Neil Anders, Odd-Børre Humborstad, Jonatan Nilsson, Maria Tenningen, and Aud Vold, 2020). In addition, both stress and exhaustion are particularly dangerous for fish. Fish will normally spend 15% to 20% of their energy budget on maintaining osmotic homeostasis. When they are stressed or exhausted, they may be unable to maintain this energy expenditure and begin to lose water. This can become lethal, as one experiment found that 40% of trout perished from six minutes of exhaustion (Gregory and Grandin, 1998).",33

Fish rely on a gas-filled swim bladder in order to stay buoyant in the water. When fish are quickly brought to the surface from deeper water, this swim bladder can rupture, forcing gas through their bodies and in some cases forcing their internal organs out through their mouths (Mike Breen, Neil Anders, Odd-Børre Humborstad, Jonatan Nilsson, Maria Tenningen, and Aud Vold, 2020). These injuries commonly occur when fish are caught at depths of 25m or more (Veldhuizen et al., 2018). This risk may be reduced by bringing fishing gear to surface more slowly (interview proceedings), though this would have to be weighed against the increased time fish would spend suffering in the net or on the hook. Fish capture depth can also be reduced in some cases, which would improve welfare, but is normally constrained by the depth range of the species (Veldhuizen et al., 2018).",34

These animals could therefore be the poster children for a campaign to reduce bycatch. However, the interests of dolphins are not always aligned with the interests of other animals. For example, using floating objects in purse seine fishing will attract fish but not dolphins and therefore lower the relative proportion of dolphins caught. However, other potential bycatch animals are attracted to the floating objects and so the strategy may raise the total proportion of bycatch (Mood, 2010).

Reducing ‘ghost nets’ – abandoned nets that continue to catch animals and contribute significantly to the amount of garbage in the world’s oceans – is another possible environmental campaign angle with a significant animal welfare benefit as well (AAA, no date a). 

Targeting larger fish rather than smaller fish (whether of the same species or different species) will also have important welfare benefits while potentially having environmental benefits (increasing fish population sizes) that could support a campaign. 

Dredging, beam trawling and demersal trawling rip up ocean floor habitats, so there is a strong environmental case for preventing them. There may also be a significant animal welfare reason for doing so because of the large amount of bycatch that they generate (Billington and Kirsch, 2021). Fishing fleets account for 1.2% of global oil consumption, though this is a lower total than other forms of animal agriculture (Mood, 2010).",145

Acute stress immediately prior to slaughter has been found to reduce meat quality in a variety of species (Mike Breen, Neil Anders, Odd-Børre Humborstad, Jonatan Nilsson, Maria Tenningen, and Aud Vold, 2020). This is why the meat of large, expensive fish is sometimes slaughtered in a more humane way, such as through spiking.

Along with purse seines, these methods are associated with increased mortality more than other capture methods, which is one of the best proxies we have for the relative suffering associated with them (Veldhuizen et al., 2018). Fishing depth is also associated with increased mortality, perhaps because of barotrauma among other injuries, and bottom trawling and dredging is typically done at deeper depths than other forms of fishing (Veldhuizen et al., 2018). Having said this, data to inform comparisons of the amount of fish suffering associated with different methods are lacking, and so we cannot be very confident that they are associated with more suffering than alternatives. However, given the evidence of high rates of bycatch, increased mortality, and a judgement call based on how bad the capture method sounds, we believe that it is worse than the capture methods that would counterfactually replace it if it were banned. Bottom trawling is also a common method for catching shrimp, which is a type of fishing that both results in a disproportionate number of animals being killed and results in high rates of bycatch (though bycatch rates are lower than in tropical shrimp fisheries) (Gillett, 2008).

Secondly, if the fishing industry adopts practices that incidentally improve both fish welfare and meat quantity – for example, by reducing the amount of fish flesh that is too damaged to be consumed as meat – this could lead to an overall lower catch and, therefore, reduce the fishing mortality of the targeted fish species. This might also cause an increase in the population numbers of the target fish species.

Also, if the industry adopts practices that improve fish welfare, such practices might change the industry's broader fishing patterns. For example, there might be changes in fishing methods, technologies aboard the vessels, and the distribution of fishing effort in space and time. These changes might cause the overall catch to increase, decrease, or change in species composition.

This would suggest that the rise of aquaculture might not be such a detriment to wild caught fisheries. However, fish meal may be imported from elsewhere rather than produced domestically: according to Seafood Source, in 2010, 135,400 tonnes of fishmeal were used in the UK, with 97,400 tonnes of these being imported and the remaining 38,000 tonnes produced in the UK (Seafood Source, no date). Exports to Peru are responsible for the bulk of UK fishmeal imports at 33,600 metric tonnes, followed closely by Demark at 29,700 tonnes, then Germany at 14,900 tonnes, Ireland 10,900 tonnes, Norway at 3,600 metric tonnes, and finally Iceland at 2,800 metric tonnes (Seafood Source, no date). 

Ultimately, the biggest bottleneck is a collapse of commonly fished wild fish populations (Gregory and Grandin, 1998). Therefore, if the number of fish killed by the fishing industry decreases, the populations will increase accordingly, incentivizing more fishing. This suggests that if there is not a further precipitous decline in wild fish populations, we should not see precipitous declines in fish catches.",221

The author compares states' positions in GPIs to the speed with which those states ratify various treaties. Since treaties come with a clear ""adopted / not adopted"" signal, the author is able to provide counterfactual evidence about whether GPIs increase the probability of policy change. The author concludes that ""states in the mid-range of the indicator are faster to ratify than states that are not ranked, whereas the other categories are statistically insignificant. These findings imply that indicators matter for those in the middle, but not as much for those at the extremes.""

In a book edited by Malito et al. (7), there are many cases of GPIs that have become very powerful (e.g. Human Development Index). There is even mention of ""a civil society organisation (Human Rights and Displacement Consultancy, CODHES) that does activism by producing indicators on internally displaced people and then confronts the national governments with the figures.""

The book edited by Kelley and Simmons (9) reviews the evidence of the effects of GPIs. The evidence is limited to a few policy domains, but there are some general insights. As the authors conclude: ""We have shown that GPIs can influence how an issue is discussed and understood and that some GPIs have ultimately altered the content or speed of reforms in the policy areas targeted [...] Sometimes specific laws and practices change as a result of GPIs."" The authors argue that GPIs ""can have very real effects on the targeted state through a status mechanism"". Policymakers ""know that their state is being ranked"", and that ""their performance will be splashed across the internet"", and so ""they experience social pressure to conform"". The authors point out that ""the media is particularly fond of reporting relative rankings"", so GPIs can help gain media attention for an issue. Finally, the authors emphasise the importance of the GPIs being produced by organisations that are perceived as having expertise.

One specific chapter in that book deals with the Aid Transparency Index, created by an NGO that was ""small, with nine staff members and a 2017 budget of less than £600,000"", ""housed in a modest one-room office above an Italian restaurant on London’s South Bank"", and had ""no direct material power"". Nevertheless, this NGO ""used its political independence and first-mover advantage to establish the gold standard for funding transparency"" (9).

Schleicher (17) reviews international GPIs with a focus on the education system. The author concludes that GPIs are a ""powerful instrument for policy reform"". GPIs can show what is possible; set policy targets and identify policy levers; establish trajectories for reform. GPIs transform a specialised/technical debate into a public debate. The author also gives examples in education where international GPIs have raised public awareness, engaged stakeholders in support of policy reform, and created political momentum - in many cases leading to concrete reforms. Notably, reform has typically occurred when countries score poorly, but reform has also occurred when the scores revealed specific problems that stakeholders were not already aware of (e.g. socioeconomic disparities in learning opportunities in Germany). The author does warn that ""policymakers tend to use them selectively, often in support of existing policies rather than as instruments to challenge them and explore alternatives.""

Kelley (18) focuses on ""scorecard diplomacy"", where GPIs are embedded in traditional diplomacy. In other words, Kelley focuses on GPIs that are created by governments to place pressure on other governments. Kelley argues that GPIs have ""the power to shape the reputations of states."" The author provides evidence that policymakers do become upset when they receive scores that are worse than those of their peers. However, evidence that GPIs actually affect policy remains mixed, largely due to the confounded variables involved in this question.",29

When the people in a country feel shamed by outsiders, there may be public and political backlash: ""a strong, negative, public, and often angry societal reaction"" (14). A negative emotional reaction can cause policymakers to become more resistant to policy change, which might actually make policy change more difficult than it was in the first place. As Snyder (8) writes, there is a ""well-established risk that backlash of shaming can produce outcomes that are counterproductive for rights"". This is most relevant in jurisdictions that receive a negative score. This is probably a big risk, and there is strong evidence that this does occur (8,13,20–27).

Trade-offs. Increasing the amount of attention for specific animal welfare reforms could take attention away from other important issues (within or outside of animal advocacy) (14). This is probably not a huge risk.

Counteraction. When policymakers do indeed reform policy, they may strategically weaken policy in other areas at the same time (14). This can allow the policymaker to meet the specific demands placed on them while compensating in other areas (e.g. keeping the industry happy overall). This is probably not a huge risk.

The tortoise and the hare. If a jurisdiction performs well on a GPI, the policymakers in that jurisdiction may be incentivised not to adopt any new animal welfare policies (15,28,29). However, there is not much evidence that this would actually decrease the probability that jurisdictions would adopt new policies, relative to the scenario where that jurisdiction was not ranked at all.",32

Target policymakers are made to feel like they can readily move up in the rankings, and it is clear how they can do so.

We might expect, conservatively, that one set of GPIs every few years causes a policy to be implemented where that policy would not have otherwise been implemented. It is also worth noting that each set of GPIs would target multiple countries, making this a very conservative estimate.

Under these assumptions, it would cost the movement a few hundred thousand US dollars to buy a counterfactual policy.

These GPIs would typically be aimed at the most numerous groups of farmed animals in a particular region, like chickens, fish or shrimp. It is standard for an averaged-sized country to have somewhere in the vicinity of 10 million chickens alive at any one time.

If you divide the impact (millions of animal-years benefitted per year) by the costs (a few hundred thousand dollars), the number of animals helped per dollar does seem potentially high (e.g. comparable to corporate cage-free campaigns (35)).

This would include products such as foie gras and fur. The other factor is the improvement in the welfare of animals raised to produce products that are still imported into Switzerland. This factor is more complex, as the benefits to animal welfare depend on the relative strength of Swiss animal welfare law compared to the animal welfare laws of the exporting country, as well as how these laws are implemented in practice.",3

Switzerland banned cages (both barren cages and enriched cages) for hens in 1992. The use of barren cages is illegal in the EU. However, 49% of hens in the EU are still in enriched cages and Switzerland still imports some caged eggs (although these must be labelled).(BBC News, 2021) The EU recently announced that it plans to ban all cages by 2027(McDougal, 2021) so this ask is unlikely to be implemented before the ban comes into force.

Broiler chickens

EU law allows countries some flexibility on setting maximum stocking densities for broilers. While a maximum of 42 kg/m2 is mandated, the majority of countries stock somewhere between 33 kg/m2 and 39 kg/m3. However, notable exceptions include France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, where most broilers are stocked at above 39 kg/m2.(EU Broiler Chicken Welfare, no date) In Switzerland, the maximum stocking density for broiler chickens is 30 kg/m2.(Federal Council, 2020) 

Pigs

The EU allows for tail docking to be carried out as long as it is not performed routinely and there is evidence that it is required. However, this law is currently not enforced effectively and, on average, 77% of pigs are routinely tail docked in EU countries.(De Briyne et al., 2018) In Switzerland, tail docking is banned and fewer than 5% of pigs are tail docked.(De Briyne et al., 2018) 

Farmed fish

The EU only requires that farmed fish “shall be spared any avoidable pain, distress or suffering during their killing and related operations” but does not include a requirement that fish must be stunned before slaughter.(Giménez-Candela, Saraiva and Bauer, 2020) In contrast, Swiss law states that “Vertebrates and crayfish may only be killed under anesthesia. If anesthesia is not possible, everything necessary must be done to reduce pain, suffering and anxiety to a minimum.” Permitted stunning methods for fish and crayfish are also provided in the Ordinance.(Federal Council, 2020)",10

Broadly speaking, we would expect initial support for this initiative to be similar to the UK figures as both animal advocates and farmers would be in favour of the policy. The main areas of resistance would come from from the Federal Council, who are likely to recommend the rejection of the initiative because of concerns about WTO rules and implementation, as well as free trade advocates.(The Federal Council, 2020)  ",18

This was launched in 2015 and voted on in 2018.(Federal Council, 2021) The text of the initiative aimed to add an additional clause to ‘Article 104: Agriculture of the Constitution, Art. 104b: Food’. This required the federal government to strengthen the range of foods offered which are of good quality, safe, environmentally and resource-friendly, animal-friendly, and produced under fair labour working conditions(Federal Council, 2018) as well as setting standards for transport and the storage of food. More importantly for our purposes, the initiative also included a clause that also required imported products to adhere to these conditions. Unfortunately, this initiative was rejected 61.3% to 38.7% with a 37.52% turnout(Federal Council, 2021). Part of the reasoning for the government and parliament's recommendation to reject the initiative was because it would conflict with current trade agreements.(Swissinfo, 2018) However, given that several other clauses were included in the initiative, it is difficult to determine whether its failure was caused by the import restrictions. Given the recommendation of rejection was grounded in trade concerns it’s likely that the government would also recommend the rejection of this initiative. Then the uncertainty remains as to whether the generally high levels of public support for this policy found in other areas will be swayed significantly enough by this recommendation to cause this initiative to fail. From the information available we conclude that this initiative has a moderate chance of success however Sentience Politics has access to an opinion poll conducted in Switzerland on this issue so has more information to make the judgement on whether this initiative will be successful.

Indeed, a paper published in 2006 states that import tariffs or bans for animal welfare reasons conflict with WTO rules. Principally, this is because trade law considers two animal products which are identical in their finished form to be ‘like products’ even if they were made using different production methods (Grethe, 2007).

Other import bans have been upheld by the WTO for animal products that have been produced at lower standards than is legal in the importing country.

One their own, these  two effects make up 90% of the value of the ask, with most of the rest of the value (~9%) coming from a reduction in caged eggs. This is largely driven by the vastly greater number of chickens and fish imported into Switzerland each year, with about 100 times more chickens imported per year than sheep, the next most imported animal. These two effects alone make this ask look incredibly impactful, with the potential to possibly improve the lives of tens of millions of individuals. The main concerns raised in the CEA, other than the probability of success and counterfactual speed up which are concerns for all asks, is the uncertainty with the number and source (whether farmed or wild caught) of the imports of fish. The lack of accurate information on these parameters means that the importance of this effect could range within an order of magnitude. However, when compared to our next most promising ask ‘particularly cruel products’, this ask still looks more impactful. This is even more the case when we consider that we did not include the effect that a broader import ban would have on cruel products. If these products are also included, as is most likely, then this ask pareto-dominates the cruel products ask, given they have equal probability of success.",40

For some items, such as frogs legs or shark fins, enforcement would be significantly easier than the Federal Council has previously suggested, as all examples of these products can be considered cruel. Previous instances of such bans, such as on seal products or the ban on cat fur, are examples of enforcement on individual products being largely successful. For other products, analysis of previous instances of lower welfare bans or tariffs would be beneficial, such as an assessment of the EU-Mercosur trade agreement which has successfully placed conditional tariffs on egg imports that are not raised to EU standards (Busby, 2019).

To cope with this problem, the process of determining cost of compliance and equivalence requirements must be allocated to an institution independent from producer interests. Another issue comes in the determination of equivalence, since it is difficult to unambiguously assess different husbandry systems with respect to their degree of animal friendliness. For example, a production system may be superior to Swiss standards on one metric (e.g. space) but inferior on another (e.g. provision of enrichment). Therefore, any system of enforcement needs to be limited to significant differences in animal welfare standards on which some consensus can be reached. The report points to international organic certification standards as an example of how a ‘process standard’ can work across borders. Apparently, compliance with these standards in Europe is ascertained at a relatively low cost, usually less than 1% of product value(Grethe, 2007)",44

For foie gras, 38% of consumers are willing to travel abroad to France or elsewhere to circumnavigate the ban (‘La réalité du foie gras en Suisse’, 2019). Given the lack of information available for other cruel products, we should take this as a rough prior for the percentage of consumers who would travel abroad for less frequently purchased luxury products. However, for items such as fur, exotic leather, and live-plucked down, faux or replacement products are more difficult to distinguish from the genuine product. One would expect this to reduce the desire to travel abroad for the real product. Again, there are also reasons to expect caged eggs to differ significantly, as consumers are typically willing to pay more for cage-free vs caged eggs (Lusk, 2019) and the two products are virtually identical. This means cross-border shopping will be largely determined by the potential cost savings of doing so (Leal, López-Laborda and Rodrigo, 2010). Therefore, we expect a greatly reduced motivation for cross-border shopping for these goods.",45

This means maintaining high standards for imports is as important or more important for some products than domestic production. The number of individual carcasses imported each year numbers in the tens of millions for fish and chickens, and tens or hundreds of thousands for other commonly farmed species like sheep, cattle, and pigs. In addition, wider import regulations will likely also affect many of the cruel products examined in our second report. This means that if successful, this ask is almost guaranteed to be more impactful than a more targeted cruel products ban. Fortunately, there also appears to be sufficient public support to give this initiative a fair chance of succeeding (Sentience Politics also have access to 2018 survey data on this issue that they are not permitted to share publicly). Given the large potential impact, reasonable level of public support, and the plausible compliance with WTO rules, we think the expected value of this initiative is very high and view it as the most promising ask for a Swiss initiative.

Each of these mechanisms would have different benefits and risks. For example, implementing this ask within trade agreements would have much lower legal risk; a Bill implementing a blanket ban would be much faster and more comprehensive; and a power enabling the MPs to decide requirements might allow welfare standards on imports to increase more easily in the future. There are alternative options, including multilateral agreements, preferential tariffs, labelling, and retailer action (see section ""Alternative policies"").

Secondly, lower-welfare imports may come to dominate the UK's market, expanding lower-welfare production in other countries (Grethe 2007). Thirdly, since lower-welfare products are cheaper to produce, UK farmers may not be able to compete with foreign producers (House of Lords 2017). As such, farmers may pressure the UK government to abandon, weaken, or slow the improvement of the UK’s welfare standards (Trade and Agriculture Commission 2021; House of Lords 2017; Offor 2020).

Although this would depend on how this ask is implemented in legislation, we believe that this dimension of the ask may magnify its overall impact considerably.

Given the immense number of existing regulations on imports that are enforced and penalised at the border, this task is comparatively trivial. This enforcement could also involve penalising UK companies that sell lower-welfare imports, as an alternative to directly penalising overseas companies.

This scenario uses scores from the Animal Protection Index by World Animal Protection (2020a). Some countries are not included in that Index. For these countries, we calculated scores on the basis of GDP per capita. This scenario is more realistic in terms of absolute numbers. However, the scenario is unreliable when it comes to species composition.

In Scenario 3, we assume that this ask affects imports from all countries other than Australia, New Zealand, and the European Union. These are the three trading partners with which the UK has already signed trade agreements. This scenario provides insight into how effective this ask might be if it does not apply to those trading partners.

In Scenario 4, we assume that this ask only affects imports from countries with lower farm animal welfare than the UK, as well as excluding Australia, New Zealand, and the European Union. In other words, we consider the countries that meet the criteria for inclusion in both Scenario 2 and Scenario 3.",118

Thailand's stated aim is to be the ""kitchen of the world"", and the country exports chickens to many countries (Ipsos Business Consulting 2013). The highest volumes go to Japan and the EU. Since the EU has also been considering this ask, there is a chance that the EU and the UK could both implement restrictions on the imports of lower-welfare chicken products. Speculatively, this could encourage Thailand's chicken industry to improve chicken welfare to adapt to these new restrictions by the major importers that are the EU and the UK. Although Thailand's farmed animal standards are low, the welfare standards for chickens do seem to have improved in recent years (World Animal Protection 2020b; Johnson 2018). A campaign that adopts this strategy should first research the specific ways in which Thailand's chicken welfare standards differ from those in the UK.",121

This is most likely for farmed fish, as there are several ongoing campaigns to improve welfare standards for farmed fish. For this reason, considering farmed fish is one way to understand the potential long-term benefits of this ask.

Secondly, we only have a tentative idea of which countries have lower animal welfare standards than the UK. This makes it difficult to understand how many animals would be affected by this ask. Thirdly, the trade patterns of Northern Ireland are likely to be different, given the effects of the Northern Ireland Protocol. Furthermore, in the CEA, we have assumed that different versions of the ask apply to different sets of countries.

Our expert interviews were indeed supportive of committing additional resources towards this ask (see above, ""Expert Interviews"").",147

Together, these umbrella groups represent 14 organisations that have expressed support for restricting trade on lower-welfare imports. (We are also aware of at least one organisation working, more broadly, on trade and animal welfare in the UK.) However, while all of these organisations have expressed support for this ask, only a handful have actually committed significant resources to a campaign on this ask. Previous efforts have also failed to achieve this ask. Therefore, we believe that there is more space for further effort than the figure of ""14 organisations"" would initially suggest.",148

In countries with which the UK trades, this ask may lead to changes in employment patterns and economic opportunities. Such changes may have profound effects, positive and/or negative, on the lives of people. Since there is a correlation between per-capita income and farm animal welfare across countries, this ask risks moving employment from lower-income countries to higher-income countries. More broadly, animal advocacy has a history of being used to oppress people who undertake practices that do not conform to mainstream Western ideals (Feliz 2019; Blattner 2019). Given this, advocating against lower-welfare practices overseas may reinforce harmful racial prejudices (Kymlicka and Donaldson 2014; Feliz 2017). This is a particular risk with this ask, as most of the impact comes from improving the lives of chickens raised for meat and the majority of chicken meat imports currently come from Thailand and Brazil.

This is particularly concerning given that chickens and fish tend to be farmed under conditions more harmful for their welfare than cows and sheep (Charity Entrepreneurship 2018; Animal Charity Evaluators 2020).

However, we have seen no formal analysis on the effect of this ask on food prices or on the relative consumption of different types of meat. Also, we expect that the price of chicken would increase by a higher proportion than the price of beef, which would move consumption in the opposite direction of the SARP - in other words, consuming fewer animals.

A Commissioner is a type of proxy advocate - by studying the regulatory process and reporting on shortcomings and improvements, a Commissioner can help overcome biases and inaction in the government's animal welfare regulatory regime, even despite the Commissioner's limited powers (12).

The Commissioner for Animal Welfare was established by a 2014 amendment to Malta's Animal Welfare Act (13), after campaigning by animal advocacy organisations led to a 2013 election promise by the Labour party (14). The Commissioner has the power to conduct independent investigations into animal welfare regulations, publish reports, and make recommendations to the government (13). The Commissioner also has an educational role that involves promoting public dialogue on animal issues. However, the Commissioner does not have the power to investigate specific instances of cruelty (a responsibility held by other authorities) or enforce recommendations (14). The Commissioner is appointed by the Prime Minister, after consultation with the Minister responsible for veterinary services. Since 2021, the position of Commissioner has been held by Alison Bezzina, a well-known animal rights activist. Bezzina publishes quarterly and annual reports. During 2021, Bezzina's first year as Commissioner, she made 15 recommendations to the government: eight of these related to dog and cat welfare, four to enforcement of animal welfare laws, one to the resources allocated to animal welfare governance, one to animals kept in zoos, and one to wild animals (15). Many of these have been implemented, and some remain under discussion. Bezzina's first year also involved conducting some investigations, mostly into dog welfare, and distributing educational materials to schools and homes. There is notably a focus on companion animals, like dogs and cats, rather than farmed animals. This is because the Commissioner does not investigate instances of cruelty themselves - rather, the Animal Welfare directorate and the Veterinary Services directorate conduct investigations, and if members of the public are dissatisfied, they can ask the Commissioner to investigate the functions of those directorates. Since the public is in greater contact with companion animals, the result is that much of the Commissioner's work relates to companion animals, rather than farmed animals² (14).",20

This independent review found that live animal export posed a high risk to animal welfare and that there is an inherent contradiction in the Department's dual role as both a facilitator of trade and a regulator of trade (16). As such, the review recommended that an Inspector-General be established to 'review the performance of functions or exercise of powers by department staff members in the regulation of live animal exports'. The Inspector-General reviews the performance of the Department in regulating exports of live animals.

This position arose after campaigns by animal advocacy organisations led to a 2013 election promise by the Labour party to establish a Commissioner (14). This promise was fulfilled, although the role as established was admittedly slightly different to the role that was promised. Nevertheless, this indicates that campaigning for an Independent Office (or Commissioner) is tractable.

The strategy of the Australian Alliance for Animals is to use three prongs: gathering public support, engaging the government (e.g. attracting the support of MPs with strong policy briefings), and building political pressure to make this policy a priority, particularly during election campaigns.

Generally, the public is receptive to this campaign. Learning about the contradiction of animal welfare being the responsibility of the agriculture ministry can be a revelation for many people. Awareness and support can be generated through media coverage, particularly when an instance of cruelty is publicised or when a contradictory position by the agriculture minister is exposed. The support of community organisations - particularly organisations that are popular among the public - is also important.

The details of the campaign and the proposed policy need to be adapted to the political context and political dynamics of a particular country. For example: in New Zealand, a Commissioner appears more politically feasible than an Independent Office because the country has a history of establishing Commissioners in other policy areas; Australia and Canada have federal systems, which affects where responsibility for animal welfare sits and the number of different governments that need to be brought on board with a campaign; and in Australia, the animal agriculture industry has more influence over one major political party (Liberal) than another (Labor), which means that the campaign may have greater success when the latter party is in power.

Advocates should understand that this campaign is not merely a technical change. Rather, the campaign is fundamentally about power - specifically, who has power over animal welfare standards. The animal agriculture industry can feel threatened by this campaign because it sees the campaign as seeking to take power away from the industry. As such, this campaign will always involve a political battle.

Ideally, the policy needs to be implemented in a way that will not cause it to be abolished as soon as there is a change in government. Building relationships with politicians from all major political parties could help with this. One strategic choice could also be to accept a compromise proposal, even if that proposal is watered down compared to the 'gold standard'. This would help parties and stakeholders become familiar with the concept and avoid regulatory shocks - then, in the future, the policy could be progressively developed into something more impactful.

Similarly, when an Independent Office or a Commissioner is established, it must not be subject to regulatory capture itself. This risk can be reduced by ensuring that the legislation protects the independence of the Office and provides sufficient guidance and transparency around the appointment of key personnel. Likewise, a policy that grants the Independent Office or Commissioner concrete powers - rather than acting as a merely consultative role - is, of course, preferable (14).

The way the policy is implemented can affect the types of policy reforms that the Independent Office or Commissioner can bring about. In Malta, the position of the Commissioner for Animal Welfare is largely designed to respond to specific public concerns about the way cases of cruelty are investigated - since the public is in greater contact with dogs and cats, this means that the Commissioner spends almost all of their time on dogs and cats rather than farmed animals (14). Since farmed animals represent the overwhelming majority of animals (and avoidable suffering) in any given country, implementing the policy in a way that permits a focus on farmed animals would be very beneficial.

Lastly, it is emphasised that this campaign is likely to be a relatively long battle. High-level policy reform is inherently the most difficult type of campaign. For this reason, it is useful to think long-term and build strong relationships with MPs and political parties.",41

These programmes grant non-government organisations (NGOs) all of the information that is available to the regulator, allow NGOs to have a seat alongside industry and the regulator during negotiations, and grant NGOs the same power to sue as the regulator (1). For a tripartite programme to work, there must be a robust network of existing non-government organisations (6). When compared with a regulatory contrarian, tripartite programmes might be more desirable when there is no single, clear 'public interest' position, or when the threat of political pressure is an important advocacy tactic (6). Goodfellow (1) speculates that advocating for the establishment of a tripartite programme for animal welfare regulation may be too difficult due to the structure and culture of typical agriculture departments.",45

A number of other mechanisms that promote greater openness around regulations, including more public input and greater media coverage and journalistic scrutiny (7). These are less relevant for animal agriculture, as regulatory capture often stems from the disproportionate power held by industry voices in negotiation, rather than an absence of public input or media coverage per se.

For two of the largest supermarket chains by employment, Walmart and Tesco, the head office accounts for only a few percent of employees with Walmart employing approximately 1.6 million associates in the US (2.1 million worldwide) (55) and only around 14,000 of these in the company's US corporate headquarters (56), 0.9% of the US workforce. Whereas Tesco has more than 330,000 colleagues (57) with about 5,000 working in their corporate headquarters (58), 1.5% of employees.  We can see that the vast majority of employees in retailers work within their physical locations. Successful organising at this level would allow the use of strong pressure tactics such as a mass walkout, causing store closures. However, doing so would require coordination between a vast number of individuals across thousands of locations. Many of those working in stores are mostly paid at or close to the respective minimum wages in their countries (59,60). An internal report from one supermarket in the US found 1 in 5 of its associates received government assistance and most considered to be living in poverty (61). In addition, the medium turnover rate is usually around 50% so most employees are not around for very long (62,63). Those engaging in activism here would likely be least financially able to risk their job and most at risk of replacement. They also lack direct access to important decision makers or the ability to gain direct influence of supply decisions. So although there is widespread evidence of concern for animal welfare across many different demographics, those in front line roles have a greatly reduced ability to act on these values. It may instead be better to use petitions from staff to campaign for change. ",45

In the US, 21% of those with a bachelor’s degree or higher had ‘boycotted a store or product or had volunteered for an animal group [in the past year]’ and a further 50% were ‘allies’, those who had ‘taken actions out of concern for animals in the past year, such as: adopting an animal from a shelter, buying meat or dairy products labelled humane, or signing a petition for an animal cause’ and ‘who said they support anti-cruelty investigations or filing lawsuits to protect animals’ (53).

This seems like the most promising area of the company to target for ease of organisation, ability of employees to engage in activism, and improved access to other internal lobbying channels.

The external union then leverages this understanding to develop relationships with these potential allies and spur them to action. Although the aims of these unions do not generalise to animal advocacy, the general approach is the same and will be indicative of what advocates can expect, particularly as this approach can be employed in companies that don’t have any employees who would otherwise act first to take the lead on organising.

Either as a whole or pre-vetted, well supported salts as would likely be used in the animal advocacy context. This makes the existing evidence pretty weak.In addition to this, although Union salting does employ a very similar theory of change to activist salting, the ask involved is aiming to better the conditions of workers who then have a self-interested incentive to organise. Still, this is not without risk to the first people to begin organising and in these cases the personal risk reward calculation may not make sense on purely self-interested grounds.

There is legal precedent, in the US, for the protection of Union organisers (68) (69), which ultimately ruled that the union and the employer can pay a ""salt"" at the same time and that the employer could not treat salts differently than non-union employees during the hiring and employment processes (68). Although generalising, outside of the union context is perilous given the stronger protections afforded to unions. This case also involves an external organisation paying the employee to salt, something that may not be necessary in all cases and makes the case much more solid against the employee. The important factors are to present no false information on the application as this can leave you open for legal action (70,71).",58

Employee groups already have widespread precedent for LGBTQ (44), Womens’ (45) and environmental resources’ groups (46) with no action taken against individuals based on membership of these groups. In some instances, these companies even encourage these sorts of individuals to apply. For the mildest forms of activism which are most common, such as talking with other colleagues about your concerns, contacting management or HR or expressing opinions in company meetings, there are few risks involved. ",59

Companies could attempt to sue employees or even ex-employees for social media campaigns and comments if the information is defamatory, which involves statements that damage a company's reputation that are “a false statement purporting to be fact” (73). For some cases, this could be a large financial risk. If a company loses a contract based on the comments, damages could exceed lifetime earnings for those with the case brought against them. Even when any statements made are true, this still would not protect the employee from being fired by the company unless they were statements of illegal behaviour at your workplace (74,75). So, for example, writing about the purchases of caged eggs or lack of progress on commitments would not concern illegal activity so would not protect you from being fired. The lawfulness of a walkout and public protest based on legal behaviour depends on the purpose, timing, and the conduct of the strikers (76). Here, unfortunately, the strike must generally concern a work-related issue to be protected under the law. Making protests taken for issues affecting those outside of the workplace unprotected and putting those involved at risk of being fired (77,78). Although, as long as the statements made are true and no damage or other illegal activity takes place during the walkout, there should be no legal liability for attending protests either.",60

Much of the research and evidence discussed here is focused on analogous causes or the use of tactics to gain concessions in other areas. So, although the approach has had some success for other causes, there is good reason to question the external validity of these cases. Particularly as the existing support for animal welfare/rights is lower than for the most prominent cases of environmentalism or for workplace issues such as discrimination or working conditions. Even within these areas, the obscure nature of most employee activism tactics makes it difficult to study. ",65

Broadly then, employee activism seems securely legal as long as you do your job well which is likely to be beneficial to your activism anyway. However, some actions that you may take won’t be protected legally, so you can be fired. It could be a good route for skill building for advocates who want to eventually work for external advocacy groups in corporate relations. An understanding of a company's inner workings and the workload involved in relevant roles would be beneficial even if attempts to influence the organisation from the inside are unsuccessful. The primary benefit at this time would thus be information value about the impact of the approach and career capital. ",66

Control of Disclosure: The party with more information can control what is disclosed and when. This allows the party with more information to employ tactics such as bluffing, misrepresentation, or strategic silence to exploit the lack of information on the other side. They can selectively reveal or withhold information to shape the negotiation process and influence the perceptions of the other party.

The authors claim that, ideally, public consultation lets policy solutions be found by rational discussion and deliberation with no voting necessary (in practice, this is not how consultations typically work - discussed further below). The authors point out that in some cases, only specific types of information will be considered and can affect the final decision. For example, in Finland's consultations on scientific field trials, the only information that the government will consider is new information concerning the scientific risk assessment. The authors conclude: ""In these cases, the room left for effective comments is thus highly limited, if not totally absent in practice.""

Quittkat and Kotzian (Quittkat and Kotzian 2011) give a systematic study of written consultations in the EU. The authors conclude that online consultations indeed ""capture the plurality of views and stakes in society"", implying that making submissions can influence policy. Of particular interest is their conclusion that participating in an online submission can lead to a longer-term relationship with policymakers: ""Participation in inclusive online consultations, often the starting point of a new policy-making cycle, increases participation in other, more exclusive consultation instruments, where participants are selected by the organisers"".

Todorova (Todorova 2020b) analyses online submission of interest group comments in EU open consultations, concluding that “High degree of influence was only obtained when technical issue was at stake that did not touch or that was in line with core political intentions of the proposed document.” Therefore, technical consultations of limited interest to other interest groups were the ones where the greatest influence could be achieved.

In a preprint analysing the effect of public consultations in Wales, Kaehne and Taylor (Kaehne and Taylor 2016) find that “individuals and organisations may struggle to effectively influence legislation.” However, they do not clearly spell out their reasoning and evidence behind this claim.

Coleman (Coleman 2004) analyses two case studies of the use of the (then relatively novel) internet as a means of facilitating public consultations. They find that the participants had a number of difficulties surrounding knowledge and trust in the internet. Given the age of the study these findings may have little relevance today.

Chalmers (Chalmers 2020) provides a similar analysis, focusing on the finance industry in the EU. The author concludes that ""the vast majority of lobbying efforts end in failure"". Though we are unsure about how this result will generalise to animal welfare, we highlight this more pessimistic finding here to temper expectations.

Kerley and Starr (Kerley and Starr 2000) analyse public consultations and Australia. They claim that there have been few rigorous attempts to evaluate whether  consultations of processes improve policy outcomes. 

Innes and Booher (Innes and Booher 2004) make perhaps the boldest claim in the literature, arguing that, at least in the US, public consultations are, essentially, not listened to and do not substantially affect policy. They argue that, as practised, public consultations in the US are effectively counterproductive on their own terms: they do not change anything and they only sow mistrust among those attempting to utilise them for change. Worse, they argue that the consultations can pit activists against each other, as they must speak in a polarised way in responding to consultations, rather than through healthy dialogue. They believe that these problems are not fixed at all, but that there are a variety of significant reforms that would have to be implemented in order to allow for productive and effectual dialogue. It is unclear as to what extent the authors believe that this would apply to other countries.

In an analysis of 8000 policy recommendations from 693 stakeholders, Hermansson (Hermansson 2016), focusing on environmental consultations, asks: ""What determines whether a policy recommendation from stakeholders will be adopted by the European Commission?"" The author concludes that the information provided is indeed often incorporated in final policies. (We discuss further conclusions of this paper in the next section).

Conrad et al. (Conrad et al. 2011) analyses the case of public consultations in Malta, finding that they often do have an influence on decisions. Specifically, public concerns over land use in Malta seem to have had a significant influence through consultations, mostly “large-scale developments in sensitive sites”, and public planners expressed cynicism regarding the public’s engagement with consultations. Some of the public planners responded that public participation is largely done because it is a legal requirement, not because of  a genuine desire to listen to what the public has to say. They described it as “ticking the box and saying, yes, we consulted the public”. Other public planners responded that many of the public suggestions were absurd and uninformed and were often responding to consultation out of an illegitimate motivation such as “jealousy, NIMBYism, personal vendettas”. Others said that the public simply expects politicians to defer to them even though they lack basic technical knowledge and expertise to make that reasonable. Public consultations on planning in Malta may be particularly contentious, because the country is very small and densely populated, the hard choices have to be made with the placement of infrastructure such as power plants. Nevertheless, this paints a less than optimistic picture of the policy influence of consultations, even if they can have significant influence in some cases.",44

We suspect that there are many across the various national, state, and local governments around the world. But the first step of this approach would be to confirm this suspicion. This could involve a review of all consultations in all jurisdictions over the past few years; an analysis of how many submissions those consultations received from other interest groups; and an analysis of how an animal advocacy organisation could have suggested policy alternatives to improve the lives of animals.

How often does the government incorporate proposals made in submissions? We know that the government incorporates proposals sometimes - that is, greater than 0% of the time, but less than 100% of the time. A quantitative analysis, ideally focusing on animal welfare-related consultations, would help refine this parameter and give a better estimate of how much policy influence we could expect to have. This analysis could be complemented by conducting interviews with government employees.",103

For consumption, we identified nine countries with low baseline consumption (rather than a steady/declining trend in consumption): Botswana, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Eswatini, and India. It could also be worthwhile to investigate the reasons for this low consumption.

For production, we have identified a dataset (1) that could be useful for figuring out why some countries adopt intensive animal production systems while others do not. But the dataset is incomplete. Spending some time developing this dataset would enable the movement to start investigating which countries have lower-than-expected levels of intensification, and whether this is due to any particular policies that could be replicated in other countries.

For both consumption and production, comparing different regions within a country could also be a promising research direction. This could also identify policies that explain differences in meat consumption or industrialisation between regions.

Consumption of meat and animal products is projected to increase substantially over the coming decades, with one study projecting a global increase of 38% between 2020 and 2050 (2). For the consumption of animal products to grow by this magnitude over the next three decades, many more animals will suffer and die to meet this demand  - in fact, since the growth will be dominated by small-bodied animals like fish, crustaceans, and chickens, the number of individual animals farmed is likely to increase by much more than 38% (3). These are also the groups of animals who, generally speaking, experience the worst welfare conditions out of all farmed animals and require the most suffering per unit of food (8–11). Moreover, the catastrophe could be compounded by the growing insect farming industry, which will likely involve farming trillions of insects - who, the evidence strongly suggests, have the capacity to feel pain (12) - to provide feed for the farming of poultry, fish, pigs, and other animals (13).",29

For example, the share of global meat consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa will probably at least double by 2100, and a quadrupling of its global share seems possible (4). This growth will likely be supported by the intensification of agriculture - more animals will be produced, and they will be farmed under more intensive conditions. By intensive animal farming, we mean the system of commercial animal farming that involves large-scale, indoor facilities, where animals are 'confined indoors under strictly-controlled conditions' (5). The definition is slightly different for fish and crustaceans, for whom intensive farming refers to systems with high stocking densities and high levels of input and management (e.g. feed); these systems are associated with numerous welfare problems (6,7). There are signs that intensive animal agriculture is politically well-supported and becoming more common in Sub-Saharan Africa (4). ",30

(17), motivated by disease risks and environmental challenges, analyse what determines the scale of production in animal farming in four developing countries. The authors conclude that many smallholders could remain economically viable for a long time, and the authors suggest ways to promote small-scale farming.

Schneider (18) describes the concept of the 'meat grab', which involves land deals undertaken to allow industrial meat production. These land deals can be direct (e.g. animal housing and stocking) or indirect (e.g. feed crop production). Schneider argues that the spread of industrial livestock production is driven by 'agribusiness-led and state-brokered industrial meat regimes' that involve land grabbing, hiding externalised costs, and promoting narratives that link meat consumption with progress.

Von Keyserlingk and Hötzel (19) discuss how studying intensive animal farming practices can generate insights for addressing animal welfare in developing countries. The authors provide a roadmap on how animal welfare could be addressed in developing countries, and they call for tailored, culturally relevant, and science-based solutions for animal welfare reform.

Lam et al. (20) examine the expansion of industrial animal farming in 10 low- and middle-income countries. This study shows that domestic policies - such as the government's objectives and the practices that are encouraged - are an important factor in the industrialisation of animal farming.

Gbejewoh et al. (21) explore one potential avenue to influencing animal production in sub-Saharan Africa: plant-based meats. The authors call for further research on the health effects of plant-based meats, as well as consumer research on the socio-cultural connotations and barriers to adoption in Africa.",34

In these three cases, meat prices are relatively low. Using the same Numbeo data as above, beef and chicken account for 33% or less of total food expenditures in all three countries. This is below the LMIC average of 37%. So, these countries have low meat consumption despite having low meat prices.

The second group includes North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Eswatini. For each of these countries, beef and chicken make up 43% or more of total food expenditures. This suggests the causes of low meat consumption in these countries do operate (at least partly) via raising meat prices. As none of these countries are especially arid, it’s unclear what these causes might be at this stage. Based on the Numbeo data, meat seems disproportionately expensive in the poorest European countries, which may help to explain the prices in the three European countries, though it’s still unclear what the mechanism might be. (The mechanism may also help explain Slovakia’s decline in meat consumption, which we discuss later in this report.)

This leaves India. India’s low level of meat consumption is mostly explained by high rates of vegetarianism among Hindus, but there are a number of caveats to this. Firstly, even if this is true, keeping rates of vegetarianism high within India could still be a major priority for animal advocates, given the large population and rising wealth of the country. Secondly, rates of vegetarianism across the country and across different social groups vary significantly (25), so Indian states with low rates of vegetarianism might still contain lessons about meat consumption that apply to other countries. Finally, if the link between Hindu belief and vegetarianism has grown stronger over time, Indian culture and policy may still contain lessons for public outreach in other countries. (Of course, care must be taken given the relationship between vegetarianism, nationalism, and caste in India.)",87

Thailand plateauing at a moderate level of meat + fish consumption remains unexplained. It looks like rising exports (as in Paraguay and Uruguay) don’t explain this trend.

Specifically, Paraguayan beef consumption peaked at 44 kg/capita in 1992, and bottomed out at 11 kg/capita in 2009, and Uruguayan beef consumption peaked in 1994 at 63 kg/capita, and bottomed out in 2007 at 19 kg/capita (FAOSTAT Food Balances data).

Secondly, in order to secure access to more demanding export markets, both countries introduced strict quality and health controls during the 1990s and 2000s. This increased domestic production costs, which was plausibly passed on to consumers.

We do not know whether alternative proteins will grow into a meaningful and permanent competitor for meat and animal products (38–40), and we do not know how the performance of alternative proteins will differ across countries. This means that relying on alternative proteins to prevent the colossal amount of animal suffering in the world's future is very risky. Separately, restricting factory farming may help alternative proteins take hold - some animal welfare improvements can make meat and animal products less economically competitive, and some improvements can even reduce the number of animals farmed in a country (41).

For example, many people and governments see the growth of animal agriculture as one pathway to economic growth and development. The issue of requiring animal welfare standards or limiting industrial growth for those living in poverty is the subject of debate (42). At the same time, issues facing humans such as poverty, disease, and food insecurity which makes it difficult for many people to see animal welfare as a priority (15). Furthermore, animal advocacy has a history of being used to oppress people who undertake practices that do not conform to dominant Western ideals (43–45). When people in developed countries advocate against particular practices overseas, this can reinforce harmful racial prejudices (46,47). That said, animal welfare is not a concept unique to Western countries - in one study across a wide variety of countries, participants in all countries agreed that the welfare of both farmed and companion animals were important, and participants supported laws protecting animal welfare (48). The authors of this present report are based in wealthy, developed countries, and we acknowledge the bias and blindspots that this position brings. Our primary aim is to provide tools, including this report, to assist the work of animal advocates living and working in developing countries - indeed, one such collaboration with an organisation based in Uganda provided the initial motivation to write this report. We are aware of many animal advocacy organisations in developing countries that are enthusiastic about limiting the growth of intensified animal farming in their own countries, and it is this work that we aim to support.",143

So, it could be worthwhile for the movement to investigate these three countries in greater depth. Additionally, the twelve countries with a steady/declining trend in meat consumption which we didn’t investigate in depth represent promising avenues for future research. Also, we identified nine countries with low baseline consumption (rather than a steady/declining trend in consumption): Botswana, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Eswatini, and India. It could also be worthwhile to investigate the reasons for this low baseline consumption. 

Production: It would be useful to improve upon the data in Figure 8 by figuring out which countries correspond to which data points. This would identify countries with levels of intensification in animal farming that are lower than would be expected based on those countries' wealth. Exploring why those countries have low levels of intensification may identify policies that could be replicated in other developing countries.

Given the scientific evidence we have available, our best guess is that these campaigns spare 3.7 animals per dollar. There is significant variance in our estimate - it is very possible that the campaigns actually have 0 impact, and it is somewhat possible that the campaigns have an impact that is several times higher than our best-guess estimate. Our best-guess estimate is in rough agreement with the cost-effectiveness estimated by previous researchers. We erred towards the conservative side when producing our calculations, so there are several important choices we made with which reasonable researchers could disagree.

Should the animal advocacy movement change the amount of resources invested in these campaigns? Based on our calculations, this campaign does not appear supremely cost-effective. On the other hand, the absolute impact of this campaign (3.7 animals per dollar) is quite reasonable, and the evidence base supporting this campaign is quite strong.

Could mass media campaigns in developing countries be a particularly impactful opportunity for these campaigns? We believe that radio and mass media campaigns in developing countries can justifiably form part of the movement's overall portfolio of outreach campaigns for meat reduction. However, we do not think it would be justified to put a disproportionately high amount of the movement's resources into radio campaigns in developing countries.

Could we create a win-win by jointly funding meat-reduction campaigns with climate-motivated funders? We find that climate funders (at least the funders strictly interested in climate and motivated primarily by cost-effectiveness) would not be keen to put large amounts of resources towards meat-reduction campaigns, even as a joint initiative. The reason is that meat-reduction campaigns appear to be a less cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions than other options available to the climate movement.",3

Optimistic (but still plausible). This scenario optimistically assumes that meat-reduction advertisements are slightly more frequent (than in our best-guess estimate) at convincing people to reduce their meat intake. We think this scenario is plausible, but somewhat unlikely (~10%). Under this scenario, we estimate that meat-reduction outreach campaigns spare 9.1 animals/USD (5.3 to 13.6).

Optimistic + cheap + long-lasting (but still plausible). This scenario assumes a longer duration of diet change and a cheaper cost-per-engagement. We think this scenario is plausible, but unlikely (~5%). Under this scenario, we estimate that meat-reduction outreach campaigns spare 84.8 animals/USD (50.1 to 127.3).

Pessimistic (but still plausible). This scenario simply assumes that the effect of the intervention is zero.

About 90% of this benefit comes from chickens and farmed fish. If you assume a typical lifespan of ~6 weeks for chickens and perhaps a bit longer for farmed fish, our best-guess estimate would correspond to roughly ~5 animal-months spared per dollar.",6

Using a simple calculation based on US consumption data, Hurford estimates that each year, one meat-eater consumes ""0.09 cows for beef; 0.004 cows for dairy; 0.24 pigs; 13.2 chickens for meat; 0.95 chickens for egg; 0.6 turkeys; 1.3 aquacultured fish"". Hurford subsequently accounts for elasticity, which we discuss separately below.

Taking these two sets of estimates as lower and upper bounds, it is reasonable to expect that adopting a vegan or vegetarian diet would prevent the farming of 16 and 26 farmed animals each year. By animal group, this corresponds to between 11.5 and 14.8 farmed birds; between 1.3 and 14 farmed fish; between 0.3 and 0.5 farmed mammals. We have focused on farmed animals in this estimate, ignoring wild-caught fish (due to the uncertainties around wild animals mentioned below).

One way to estimate the effects of reducing (rather than eliminating) meat intake is to make the following assumption: reducing meat intake by some proportion spares a number of animals equal to the number of animals who would be spared by adopting a vegan diet, multiplied by that proportion. This assumption means that if 10 people each reduce their consumption of meat and animal products by 10%, the effect is the same as if 1 person adopted a completely vegan diet. We adopt this assumption when conducting the cost-effectiveness analysis later in this report.",34

The concern with elasticity is that if there are more vegans, then meat could become cheaper to buy, which could encourage other people to buy more meat, thus potentially cancelling out any benefits. The best exploration of this question that we have found was published by Lusk and Bailey Norwood (4) and summarised by Tomasik (5) and by Barrett and Raskoff (6). As Barrett and Raskoff express these results: ""in the United States, for a sufficiently large number n, if n choices are made not to buy a chicken, 0.76n fewer chickens will be produced (6)."" The corresponding numbers for other products are 0.91 for eggs, 0.74 for pork, 0.69 for veal, 0.68 for beef, and 0.56 for milk (5). As such, these economic effects might slightly reduce the impact of eating vegan, but only by a small amount (e.g. 24% for eating less chicken).

Threshold effects: we believe that threshold effects have a negligible effect on impact. The concern with threshold effects is that, sure, one person can go vegan, but will that one person be the one to cause the supermarket to purchase less meat from their supplier, and for farms to produce fewer animals (7)? Just how sensitive are supply chains? While there is some debate about threshold effects and the expected impact of veganism (7), such debates are less important for our case. In the present report, we are not thinking about one individual going vegan, but rather convincing many people to go vegan at the same time.

The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 100 studies that tested the effects of messages on meat consumption. This review did not focus specifically on digital advertising, and messages focused on animal welfare rather than environmental or health concerns, but the immense volume of data makes it a high-quality piece of evidence nevertheless. The authors found that ""the interventions appeared consistently beneficial at least in the short term and with outcomes primarily based on self-reported behaviour or intended behaviour, on average increasing by 22% an individual’s probability of intending, self-reporting, or behaviorally demonstrating low versus high meat consumption."" This estimate was lower when the authors included only studies with longer follow-up times (e.g. 7+ days) and/or when the authors included only studies that measured self-reported or observed consumption, rather than intended consumption. When both of these limitations are applied, the corresponding estimate is about 9% (i.e., outreach increases by 9% an individual’s probability of intending, self-reporting, or behaviorally demonstrating low versus high meat consumption). In our model (see below, ""Our cost-effectiveness analysis""), this corresponds to the intervention causing around 4.5% of people to decrease their meat consumption. The danger of backfiring (people eating more meat after seeing messages) appeared rare. The authors point out that the studies in the review often used self-reported behavioural measures, which can lead to desirability bias, and that most studies only looked at meat consumption in the short-term (a month or less).",38

This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of 31 studies on reducing meat consumption, specifically in university/college settings.

The authors did not find significant differences in the effects of intervention in meat consumption between studies that used long vs. short follow-up times.",39

This may be causing us to think that the ability for outreach to reduce people's meat intake (e.g. the 4.5% estimate we mentioned above) is larger than it actually is - we may be overestimating the effect size. So, Mathur et al (2) subsequently conducted an experimental study that explicitly aimed to understand this desirability bias. This study focused on documentaries, which may be less applicable for digital media campaigns. However, this study is particularly informative because the authors explicitly conducted different trials to see whether results differed when the experimental setup minimised desirability bias. The conclusion is particularly illuminating: ""In a study designed to minimize social desirability bias [...] we found that the documentary did not affect participants’ reported consumption 12 days after random assignment [...] However, in a second study with less protection against social desirability bias [...] the documentary did substantially increase the percentage of participants who immediately intended to reduce consumption.""

This scenario assumes a diet change of 1 year and a cost-per-engagement of USD 0.03.

Optimistic (but still plausible). This assumes a higher risk ratio of 1.22, calculated by Mathur et al (1) using all studies in their meta-analysis (even those that measure only intended consumption). We think this scenario is plausible, but somewhat unlikely (~10%).

Optimistic + cheap + long-lasting (but still plausible). This assumes a longer duration of diet change (3 years rather than 1 year) and a cheaper cost-per-engagement (USD 0.0096 rather than USD 0.03). We think this scenario is plausible, but unlikely (~5%).

Pessimistic (but still plausible). This scenario simply assumes that the effect of the intervention is zero.

We use a risk ratio of 1.11, calculated by Mathur et al (1) using only studies that measure observed or self-reported consumption (rather than intended consumption). A risk ratio of 1.11 means that people who are exposed to the intervention, compared to people not exposed to the intervention, have an 11% higher probability of self-reporting or behaviourally demonstrating a lower meat consumption. In two scenarios, we increase the risk ratio to 1.22, which was calculated by Mathur et al  (1) using all studies in their meta-analysis (even those that measure only intended consumption).

Adjustment for long time frames (7+ days) (effect modification risk ratio). Mathur et al calculated that a study’s having, versus not having, a follow-up length of at least 7 days is associated with an effect modification risk ratio of 0.81. In the best-guess scenario, this reduces our initial risk ratio from 1.11 to ~1.09. We ignore this in two scenarios.

Probability of net decrease in MAP (meat and animal product) consumption, for people not exposed to the intervention (percent). We assume that this parameter is 50%. 

We need to include this parameter because we have a risk ratio, and we want to use our risk ratio to calculate the probability that the intervention will cause somebody to reduce their meat intake. To perform this calculation, we first need to make an assumption about the probability that somebody not exposed to the intervention will reduce their meat consumption. This probability equals the chance that if you ask somebody their meat consumption at two points in time, then their meat consumption will be lower at the second of the two points in time.

There are strong theoretical reasons to expect this number to be 50% - if you measure meat consumption as a point on a quantitative scale (i.e. you ignore the probability that the meat consumption of a meat-eater will be exactly identical at two points in time) and assume that there are no enormous trends in meat consumption by the population as a whole, then we would expect the baseline population (people not exposed to the intervention) to be divided into ~50% meat increases and ~50% decreases by chance alone. This is supported by our analysis of data from dietary change studies for people in the control groups: in the data from Schwitzgebel et al (11), the percentage of people in the control group who decreased their meat consumption was 49%; for Jalil et al (12), 45%; and for Macdonald et al (13), 49%. These are consistent with our theoretical estimate of 50%, subject to random sampling variation.

For reference, this baseline probability of 50% combined with our adjusted risk ratio of ~1.09 means that the intervention would have a 0.5 * 0.9 = ~4.5% chance of causing a person to reduce their meat consumption.

Mean magnitude of decrease in MAP (meat and animal product) consumption across all people who have a net decrease in MAP consumption after intervention (percent). If somebody indeed reduces their meat consumption due to the intervention, by what magnitude would we expect them to reduce their meat intake? This is a very specific parameter and has not been measured deliberately in previous studies. However, our analysis of data from Jalil et al (12) resulted in an estimate of ~16% for this parameter. A higher estimate is also plausible (see below, ""Reality checks"").

Duration of diet change (years). In our best-guess scenario, we assume that people change their diet for a mean of 1 year. We increase this to 3 years in one scenario. This choice is discussed further below (""Comparison to previous cost-effectiveness estimates"").

Average number of farmed animals consumed by a non-vegetarian (animals). We assume that a non-vegetarian consumes, on average and each year, 12.4 farmed birds, 7.2 farmed fish, and 1.4 farmed mammals (3,14).

Cumulative elasticities. Due to economic effects, an X-unit decrease in demand for a particular animal product will reduce production by a bit less than X units (4). We assume that an X-unit decrease in demand for chicken will reduce production by 0.76X units. Our corresponding values for farmed fish and farmed mammals are 0.69X and 0.74X, respectively (4,5,15). 

Cost per engagement (USD). We assume a cost per engagement of USD 0.03, based on the Facebook experiment described above (9). We decrease this to USD 0.0096 in one scenario. Notably, this is quite a bit lower than what previous analyses have assumed for the cost per click on an online ad (see below, ""Comparison to previous cost-effectiveness estimates""). We also emphasise that this is the marginal cost per engagement - this excludes, for example, the costs to run an organisation and hire the staff who run the ads. The reason we opted to use the marginal cost per engagement is that there are many existing animal advocacy organisations with staff already being paid and online advertising campaigns already running. For these organisations, extra funding could be directed almost entirely to the marginal cost of additional ads.",47

There is a small chance that the intervention could be overall harmful (i.e. true cost-effectiveness is less than zero), but we think this is unlikely too. As Mathur et al write: ""Although it seemed plausible [...] that in some settings, animal welfare appeals could be in danger of backfiring [...], our results suggested that this danger was rarely realised, as we estimated that the large majority of interventions (83%) had true population effects in the beneficial rather than detrimental direction.""",53

For example, it is possible that a paid advertisement will be shared by some social media users, magnifying the reach of the advertisement. Likewise, users who see the advertisement may follow the social media page of the organisation that was running the advertisement, leading to additional engagement in the future. This strategy is used by the advocacy organisation Kinder World.

Wild-caught fish and crustaceans. We did not include the effects of reducing meat intake on wild-caught fish and crustaceans. The economic and moral effects of reducing wild-caught fish intake are poorly understood (16).

Animals used for feed, etc. We did not include the effects of animals who are made to suffer and killed at earlier stages during the production of meat and animal products. For example, animals are killed to produce feed for farmed animals.

Room for more funding. We did not consider whether there are still markets that have room for additional outreach for meat reduction, or whether the movement has already saturated all possible markets.

Effects on friends and family. People who eat less meat may encourage their friends, families and colleagues to also eat less meat (17). This may be particularly relevant for people who cook for others (e.g. parents of young children).

Effects on policy support. People who eat less meat might (or might not) show greater support for further animal advocacy campaigns in the future, such as specific policy changes in their country (18). Likewise, people who become completely vegan or vegetarian might also become committed animal welfare advocates, meaning that there are more people working on reforming policy for animals in the future.

Systematically different effects on different demographics of people. We assume that the risk ratios provided by Mathur et al are roughly representative of the target audience of real-world meat-reduction campaigns, and we treat ""people"" as a single category rather than distinguishing between different demographics. However, there may be systematic differences in how different groups of people respond to meat-reduction campaigns. We might expect that people who are already seeking to reduce their meat consumption would be more likely to engage with meat-reduction advertisements. On the other hand, we might expect advertisements to cause a greater total reduction in individual meat consumption for people who are not already seeking to reduce their meat consumption.

Systematically different effects in different contexts. We use a cost-per-engagement comparable to a typical online ad. But we also use the risk ratios calculated by Mathur et al from a variety of different types of campaigns (e.g. online ads, hour-long lectures, full video documentaries). If lectures and documentaries are more impactful than online ads, then our cost-effectiveness estimate may be too optimistic.

Wild animals. If there are fewer animals farmed, then there might be increases and/or decreases in the amount of land used for crop farming and/or the amount of land left ""wild"". This could have enormous effects on the lives of wild insects and other wild animals (19), and there has not been much research into this question (20). Tentatively, researchers hold widely varying opinions as to whether these effects would be good or bad, important or unimportant, and so on.

Moral circle expansion. People who eat less meat might care more about animals. It is unclear whether eating less meat would cause people to care more about animals (21) and, if so, whether this ""moral circle expansion"" would be good or bad (22).

Effects on climate change and human health. Eating less meat would probably reduce greenhouse gas emissions (12). Eating less meat may also, in some contexts, improve human health (8). Most of humanity would probably regard both of these as good, though there is debate about the net effects of these on the global sum of moral value (23,24).",55

We use a risk ratio of 1.11, based on the findings from the meta-analysis of Mathur et al (1). An alternative meta-analysis, that of Chang et al (8), found a corresponding odds ratio of 1.68. This odds ratio corresponds to a risk ratio of around 1.18. This is similar to our risk ratio of 1.11, especially since we adjusted our risk ratio downwards slightly based on additional findings in the meta-analysis of Mathur et al.

Mean magnitude of decrease in MAP consumption across all people who have a net decrease in MAP consumption after intervention (input). We use an estimate of 16%, based on our analysis of the data from the experimental study by Jalil et al (12) (one of the highest-quality experimental studies available to us). We produced two alternative estimates, based instead on our analysis of the data from two other experimental studies. The data from Macdonald et al (13) would suggest an estimate of 49%, and the data from Schwitzgebel et al (11) would suggest 52%. Our estimate is certainly on the conservative side, though all three estimates are within the same order of magnitude. There is no real reason to favour one estimate over the others, aside from intuitions about the quality and generalisability of each of these three experimental studies and the real-world implications of each estimate. In real-world terms, for somebody who eats meat two times every day, a reduction of 16% would mean eating meat at around two or three fewer meals per week. Assuming an average decrease larger than this strikes us as intuitively unrealistic.

Expected decrease in MAP consumption caused by the intervention, for any person who experiences the intervention (output). Our model produced an estimate of 1.11%. We produced two alternative estimates, based on our analysis of data from Jalil et al (12) and Schwitzgebel et al (11). The corresponding estimates would be ~9% and ~23%, respectively. This would suggest that we could be underestimating the true effect size by a factor of ~10x to ~20x. Nevertheless, there are many reasons to expect that the true effect would be smaller than what these experimental studies predict (e.g. our intervention of online ads or perhaps short videos being far less intensive than hour-long lectures; many reasons for caution that were expressed in Mathur et al 2021's meta-analysis and adopted in our model). So, we are comfortable with our more modest estimate.

Sum of expected number of fewer farmed animals consumed by one person for the entire duration of the effect, adjusted for elasticity (output). Our model produced an estimate of 0.172. We produced one alternative estimate, based on our analysis of data from Amiot et al (25). The corresponding estimate was between ~1.0 and ~100, depending on some assumptions (and probably somewhere in between those two extremes). This would suggest that we could be underestimating the true effect size by a factor of ~30x to ~300x. As in reality check # 3 above, we are comfortable with our more modest estimate.",58

The only estimate in the table below that corresponds to online advertisements comes from the study by ACE (~2016-2019) (27). The original source for the cost-per-engagement in that study was ACE's evaluation of The Humane League's (THL) online advertisements for diet change, factory farming, and other topics. The spreadsheet supporting this analysis is available here, though the spreadsheet has since been updated for the 2023 analysis. In that spreadsheet, ACE calculates that the cost per person reached by THL's online ads are, in fact, either USD 0.007 or USD 0.345. The costs vary between the THL's campaigns. The cost that we use in our model (USD 0.03, based on the Facebook experiment detailed above) is well within this range. Therefore, we are comfortable with using our estimate of USD 0.03, even despite the different estimates produced by ACE.

Duration of diet change. We use 1 year (increased to 3 years in one of our modelled scenarios). This parameter is subject to a large amount of uncertainty. The evidence for this input is pretty sparse - some people think this input should be lower (e.g. a few months), and some higher (e.g. 3-4 years or more). We guess ~1 year, and we think anything lower than this is probably too pessimistic. We suspect that effects could even last ~3 years, but the evidence is too tentative to have a super high amount of confidence in this. Jalil et al (12) show that the effects can persist even after 3 years, though that study involved a long lecture rather than a short video. The meta-analysis by Mathur et al (1) (see Figure S5 in that study) doesn't really show a decline in the effect over time, at least beyond the first 7 days. That said, the studies analysed by Mathur et al have, at most, follow-up times of a few months. Similarly, the meta-analysis by Chang et al (8) found no statistically significant effect of the follow-up time on the effect size. When thinking about vegetarianism specifically, Animal Charity Evaluators (30) concluded ""that the authors' ""final 90% [subjective confidence interval] of the mean length of vegetarianism period for use in cost-effectiveness estimates of veg*n advocacy is 2.5–6.5 years."" The weakness of this estimate is that vegetarianism is different (and involves more of a conscious and public commitment) than simply reducing meat intake.

Percent of people who change their behaviour in response to the intervention. In our model, we find that the intervention causes about ~4.5% of people who engage with the intervention (e.g. people who click on the ad) to change their behaviour. In contrast, Kaufman (31) argued that expecting even ~1% of people to change their behaviour because of the intervention is unrealistic. Our figure of ~4.5% is derived from applying our risk ratio of 1.09 to a baseline probability of 50% (this is explained in detail above). The divergence in opinion here could arise from the fact that Kaufman was referring to ~1% of people who are handed a leaflet, while we're talking about ~4.5% of people who click on an ad. On the other hand, online ads could be less impactful than average when compared to all of the different interventions in the meta-analysis, many of which were quite involved (e.g. university lectures).

Chance of the intervention causing an increase, rather than decrease, in the consumption of meat and animal products. Animal Charity Evaluators (26) argued that advocating for people to reduce their meat intake has a decent chance of increasing chicken consumption - specifically, they wrote that ""the estimated standardized mean difference from the meta-analysis was symmetrically distributed with most of its probability mass on leaflets causing an increase in poultry consumption."" We believe that this position is no longer justified. For example, the experimental study by Jalil et al (12) found that when people ate less beef, they ""switched from beef towards veg, rather than to poultry + fish"". Similarly, the meta-analysis by Mathur et al (1) found that mean increases in meat consumption were quite rare, though this could mask instances where poultry increases but total meat consumption still decreases.",62

Some studies have also found that this effect holds for mass media campaigns that seek to increase people's intake of fruits and vegetables (36–38).

Campaigns in general can reduce people's consumption of animal products, including in developing countries.

These studies mostly had positive effect sizes of a comparable magnitude to the other studies included in the meta-analysis.

None of these studies tested interventions delivered through radio specifically. Separately, a population-level modelling study found that vegetarian and vegan outreach campaigns in general can increase population-level rates of vegetarianism and veganism (44).

One important consideration is much of the existing literature on mass media campaigns cover campaigns that are clearly in the interest of the people who the outreach is aimed at. Meat-reduction outreach may have some health benefits for the people receiving the outreach, but the improvement is less clear than in some other cases, and the animal welfare and environmental benefits of eating less meat are not themselves realised by the people whose diet changes.

Let's assume that $1 spares 0.5 of an animal (our best-guess estimate); for simplicity, the benefits are realised entirely by chickens; and that one chicken provides about 500 grams of cooked meat. 

This would suggest that $1 prevents the farming and preparation of the equivalent of 250 grams of cooked chicken, which corresponds to about 1.8 of the 5 oz servings used in the calculations of Jalil et al. Thus, $1 would save around ~1.82 * 1.8 = ~3 kg CO2eq. Another way of saying this is that it would cost around ~$300 to save one tonne of CO2eq.

This is a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation. In practice, our model suggests that around two-thirds of the benefit would be realised by chickens and one-third by farmed fish. The greenhouse gas emissions from chicken farming and fish farming are very similar  (12), though the amount of meat per animal may vary. Therefore, our estimate of greenhouse gas emission prevented per dollar may change slightly.",80

Given the scientific evidence we have available, our best guess is that these campaigns spare 3.7 animals per dollar. There is significant variance in our estimate - it is very possible that the campaigns actually have 0 impact, and it is somewhat possible that the campaigns have an impact that is several times higher than our best-guess estimate. Our best-guess estimate would indicate that these campaigns are roughly as impactful as previous researchers have concluded. We erred towards the conservative side when producing our calculations, so there are several important choices we made with which reasonable researchers could disagree.

Should the animal advocacy movement change the amount of resources invested in these campaigns? Based on our calculations, this campaign does not appear supremely cost-effective. That said, the evidence supporting this campaign is quite strong, and this campaign is easy to scale.

Could mass media campaigns in developing countries be a particularly impactful opportunity for these campaigns? We believe that radio and mass media campaigns in developing countries can justifiably form part of the movement's overall portfolio of outreach campaigns for meat reduction. However, we do not think it would be justified to put a disproportionately high amount of the movement's resources into radio campaigns in developing countries.

Could we create a win-win by jointly funding meat-reduction campaigns with environmentally motivated funders? We find that environmental funders (at least the funders motivated primarily by cost-effectiveness) would not be keen to put large amounts of resources towards meat-reduction campaigns, even as a joint initiative. The reason is that meat-reduction campaigns appear to be a less cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions than other options available to the environmental movement.",85

A meat tax would involve a government levying a tax on the purchase of some or all animal-derived food products, including meat, dairy, and eggs (Arvidsson, 2016; de Graad, 2020). A meat tax is currently an area of active campaigning by PETA¹. It has also been strongly recommended by the book Meatonomics (Simon, 2013) and there appears to be support for it among other animal advocacy organisations (Simmonds and Vallgårda, 2021). A campaign for a meat tax would take advantage of the momentum provided by these environmental and health organisations who have proposed meat taxes (Briggs et al., 2016; Springmann, Mason-D’Croz, et al., 2018; FAIRR, 2020).

By encouraging the government to establish a tax on meat and animal products, this campaign would increase the cost of these products. Following standard economic theory, an increase in cost would cause a decrease in the demand for meat, and consequently its consumption. However, a greater increase in cost for beef or red meat (which would occur for an emissions- or health-focused tax) would also cause consumers to substitute away from beef or red meat towards cheaper meat (e.g. chicken, fish). This means that the consumption of some types of meat would decrease, but the consumption of others might increase. Therefore, whilst a meat tax is likely to decrease the number of farmed cows and sheep, this may be offset by a larger increase in the number of farmed chickens, pigs, and fish. For this reason, it is highly uncertain whether a meat tax would, overall, benefit or harm animals. This possibility is discussed in detail throughout this report.",6

A meat tax is essentially a tax levied on the purchase of meat and other animal products. Economic theory predicts that a tax on meat would cause the price of meat to increase. This price increase would then trigger a decrease in the demand, and thus consumption, of meat (Arvidsson, 2016). Literature reviews have found that taxes on food decrease the consumption of the foods targeted (Thow, Downs and Jan, 2014; Sacks, Kwon and Backholer, 2021). The magnitude of this decrease depends on price elasticities. As an illustrative example, the own-price elasticity of beef is often calculated to be within an approximate range of -1.3 to -0.5 (e.g., Wirsenius, Hedenus and Mohlin, 2011; Abadie et al., 2016). This would suggest that a 1% increase in the price of beef would cause the consumption of beef to decrease by between 0.5% and 1.3%.",11

This is why studies modelling meat taxes focussed on environment or health concerns often predict increases (or smaller decreases) in the consumption of chickens and fish (e.g., Wirsenius, Hedenus and Mohlin, 2011). It is also worth noting that the welfare costs from even a small percentage increase in chicken and fish consumption, by weight, might be much larger than the welfare benefits from a large percentage decrease in cow and sheep consumption.

First, the True Animal Protein Price (TAPP) Coalition (2020) commissioned a survey of respondents in France (531 respondents), Germany (514), and the Netherlands (513). In those surveys, approximately 64-75% of respondents expressed support for a meat tax that was designed to improve animal welfare. In another question in those surveys, framed differently, approximately 50% of respondents expressed support. However, some scepticism about these findings may be warranted as the TAPP Coalition may have an interest in promoting the meat tax in public policy debates. In addition,  while it is reported that there was an ""appropriate distribution across gender, age, income and political background"", it is unclear whether these distributions were representative of the national populations. Second, Yavuz (2020) reports a smaller survey in each of Sweden and Turkey. Since these surveys used non-random sampling methods and small sample sizes, it is difficult to draw generalizable conclusions. Finally, FAIRR (2017) reports a survey from Sweden where 25% of respondents supported a meat tax. However, this survey is being reported second-hand, and we cannot find the original source or any methodological details of the survey.",49

There is notable agreement between the three surveys we consider particularly relevant and reliable, with 20%, 26%, or 27% of respondents in favour (Grimsrud et al., 2020; National Food Strategy, 2021; YouGov, 2021). Support may depend on demographics (YouGov, 2021) and be higher for a tax on processed meat only (National Food Strategy, 2021). Of course, these measures should not be regarded as constant since public opinion often changes as a policy or political debate develops (Adams-Cohen, 2020; e.g., Nordø, 2021).",50

Focus groups conducted by Wellesley et al. (2015) revealed that participants expect the backlash from a meat tax to be short-lived, particularly if the policy and its justification were explained well. However, many people have expressed concern about the effects of a meat tax on lower-income people. Notably, this concern was also expressed by participants in the National Food Strategy (2021) report. Research has indeed identified that people's social class, education, and material resources influence their ability to change their food consumption patterns (Einhorn, 2021). In fact, some modelling studies have investigated this phenomenon explicitly in relation to a meat tax. Chalmers et al. (2016) predicted that different socioeconomic groups would respond to a meat tax differently while Kehlbacher et al. (2016) found that an emissions-focussed food tax would disproportionately penalise lower socioeconomic groups. Beyond this, the complex values surrounding the meat tax debate in the UK are analysed by Simmonds and Vallgarda (2021). This qualitative study examines public discourse in great detail, and interested readers would benefit from reading the study in full. For our purposes, the key conclusion is that there are two levels to the meat tax debate in the UK. The first centres on the question ""Is meat consumption a problem in the UK?"", and the second on ""Is a meat tax the best way to reduce meat consumption?"". Both questions are contested. A notable nuance, specific to the UK context, is that the UK's meat production is perceived by many to be ""uniquely sustainable"". This perception leads some to the conclusion that the UK has a responsibility to produce meat for export.",51

In the book Meatonomics, Simon (2013) hypothesises that using the tax to provide a lump sum payment to every member of the public would substantially increase public support for the meat tax. In support of this hypothesis, studies have shown that public support for a meat tax may be increased if the revenue from the tax is used to pay for further public or environmental benefits (Wellesley, Happer and Froggatt, 2015; Grimsrud et al., 2020; TAPP Coalition, 2020; Muhammad, Mohd Hasnu and Ekins, 2021). A second major driver of public support is communication. Public support for environmental taxes is generally higher when the public is well-informed about the tax, the details of the tax, and the effectiveness of the tax (Muhammad, Mohd Hasnu and Ekins, 2021). Likewise, public support is generally higher when the policy is perceived to distribute costs and benefits fairly among members of society (Muhammad, Mohd Hasnu and Ekins, 2021). Finally, the public may offer greater support if a tax is described or framed in particular ways (Grimsrud et al., 2020).",54

The general view from these authors was that a carbon-weighted foods tax would have a consistently good effect on environmental outcomes but that the exact changes in the consumption of different products would be difficult to predict.

Our literature review identified many studies that modelled the effects of a meat tax on consumption (see Appendix). From those studies, we selected the six studies above for two reasons. Firstly, these studies each include a wide range of meat and animal products, which is important for understanding the overall effect of a tax across many animal species. Secondly, these studies are relevant to the context of the UK or the EU. Where the studies modelled both uncompensated (i.e., a revenue-positive tax) and compensated (i.e., a revenue-neutral tax) scenarios, we used the compensated scenario.

However, fewer studies appear to model the effects of a meat tax for health, and the ones that do are both less specific to the UK context and consider far fewer products (see Appendix).

It seems reasonable to assume that there is a positive relationship between the production of farmed fish, poultry, and pigs and the production of fishmeal, although we haven't tested this assumption. Three studies (Studies 1, 3, 6D) predict a decrease in the consumption of farmed fish, poultry, and pigs, and we would expect this to translate to a decrease in fishmeal production. Two studies (Studies 2, 6A) predict an increase in the consumption of farmed fish, poultry, and pigs, and we would expect this to translate to an increase in fishmeal production. There is substantial variation in the magnitude of the predicted change in consumption of farmed fish, poultry, and pigs across all studies. Four studies either predicted a different direction of consumption change between farmed fish, poultry, and pigs (Studies 6B, 6C), or excluded fish from the analysis (Studies 4, 5).",101

Lower greenhouse gas emissions would help in humanity's battle against climate change. However, the effects of climate change on animal suffering are unclear (Brian Tomasik, 2018). Separately, the reduced consumption of red meat is likely to improve human health, at least among privileged socio-economic groups (Briggs et al., 2013).

This would incentivise consumers to substitute domestically produced meat for imported meat. The result of such a policy may be that animal suffering is not necessarily reduced, but merely displaced to a different country¹⁰. Animal suffering may even increase overall, as farmed animal welfare in the UK appears to be better than average (World Animal Protection, 2020). To avoid merely shifting animal suffering to a different country, a meat tax would ideally be levied on consumption rather than production (Wirsenius, Hedenus and Mohlin, 2011; García-Muros et al., 2017).

For example, the government could use the revenue to reduce other taxes, such as income tax or value-added tax (Grimsrud et al., 2020; Muhammad, Mohd Hasnu and Ekins, 2021). This may deliver economic benefits and improve human wellbeing, although that hypothesis depends on context and is debated in the literature (Freire-González, 2018). An example of this is found in several of the modelling studies we reviewed that explicitly consider scenarios where the tax revenue is used to subsidise low-emission foods (Briggs et al., 2013, 2016; Edjabou and Smed, 2013). Similarly, the government could use the revenue to deliver public benefits such as lump-sum payments (Simon, 2013) or reduced university  tuition fees (Muhammad, Mohd Hasnu and Ekins, 2021), each of which may have positive social effects. Alternatively, the government could deliver environmental benefits, such as habitat protection or the further development of renewable energy (Grimsrud et al., 2020; Muhammad, Mohd Hasnu and Ekins, 2021). These measures would likely improve environmental sustainability and human wellbeing. However, environmental benefits may cause greater suffering to animals, depending on the context and given some strong assumptions (e.g., Tomasik, 2017; Brian Tomasik, 2018).",109

However, it is also plausible that a meat tax would lead people to believe that it is acceptable to exploit animals, as long as the cost of doing so is high enough. This could make people feel less complicit in animal exploitation, potentially contributing to the ""psychological refuge effect"" (Anthis, 2017).

While a meat tax could reduce the number of animals killed for food, the tax also carries a substantial risk of increasing this number and thus causing overall harm. The probability of this risk is very difficult to calculate. However, as shown in our detailed analysis, many modelling studies do indeed predict an overall increase in the number of animals killed for food. In particular, many environmental- and health-motivated policies would place higher taxes on beef than chicken or fish, exacerbating this risk. Furthermore, public support for a meat tax is very low meaning any campaign would have a low probability of success. For this reason, we do not recommend campaigning for a meat tax. We instead encourage animal advocacy organisations to select an ask that has a more robust and favourable base of evidence.",113

For each campaign, we calculate the cumulative time in pain that would be prevented for an animal affected by the campaign, and the cumulative time in pleasure that would be created. This closely follows the Cumulative Time method published by Alonso and Schuck-Paim, except we have added pleasure categories to complement the existing pain categories. Pain and pleasure are each considered as four categories of different intensities (eight categories total).

We multiply these numbers by the reach of the campaign (i.e. number of animals who would be directly affected) to calculate the total cumulative time in pain prevented, and pleasure caused, by the campaign.

We consider the moral weightings associated with each pain or pleasure category. In practice, we consider numerous sets of weightings, each associated with a particular worldview about the moral value of different intensities of pain and pleasure. This lets us convert the four pain categories and the four pleasure categories to a single, common metric.

We consider our credence in each of these worldviews, as well as a range of ""soft"", qualitative factors (e.g. tractability, scalability, and so on) to arrive at final rankings of campaign ideas.

By including established, high-impact campaigns (e.g. cage-free hens, slow-growing broiler chickens) in this process, we can see how new campaign ideas compare to these existing campaigns.",11

More intense experiences seem to matter more than less intense experiences, all else being equal. Also, a single experience might have a different intensity at different points in time.

Captures the duration of animals' experiences. Longer experiences seem to matter more than shorter experiences, all else being equal.

Allows us to consider many different animal species. Our research involves species whose physiology and welfare is both well-understood (e.g. chickens) and poorly-understood (e.g. black soldier flies). We do not want to be limited to only the well-understood species.

Allows us to consider many different interventions for any particular animal species. For example, if we were looking at farmed carp, we might want to compare improving water quality to implementing humane slaughter. These have very different intensities and durations, but we need to compare both.

Captures both negative and positive welfare. Some interventions focus entirely on preventing suffering (e.g. implementing humane slaughter), while other interventions might also create pleasure (e.g. environmental enrichment). We want to consider both of these aspects, even if we might not place the same moral importance on creating pleasure versus preventing suffering (see the next point, # 6).

Allows us to incorporate multiple, competing worldviews in a transparent way. There are major debates around what the ""best"" moral worldviews are, and even how to make decisions in light of this moral uncertainty (1,2). For our purposes, we think the best way to account for this uncertainty is ""worldview diversification"", in which we systematically incorporate information from all major/plausible moral worldviews. So, our framework needs to allow for this. For example, different worldviews might make different tradeoffs between the intensity and duration of pain, or between the value of pleasure versus pain. If a campaign idea looks particularly strong regardless of these tradeoffs (3), then we can have more confidence in that idea.

Allows us to place different moral weight on different animal species. It is plausible that the experiences of some animal species might have more or less moral importance than those of other animal species, though this is a topic of active research and debate. For example, see the work by Rethink Priorities (4) and Open Philanthropy (5).

Can produce estimates for both welfare improvements and lives averted. For example, we might want to compare improving chicken welfare, which improves the lives of chickens, versus reducing chicken consumption, which means that fewer chickens are brought into existence.

Has existing estimates for leading animal advocacy campaigns. Our current goal as an organisation is to identify campaigns that might have an impact comparable to, or greater than, existing high-impact animal advocacy campaigns, so having access to estimates for these leading campaigns can provide a useful benchmark against which to compare new candidate campaigns.

Can be applied relatively quickly. During our research process, we will examine hundreds of campaign ideas each year.

Can be challenged and debated as new empirical data arises. Since most animal species and campaign ideas are poorly studied, it is unavoidable that our estimates will often be based on limited information. However, it is important that these estimates are transparent, so they can be criticised by others and updated as new data emerges.",18

Pain-Track describes pain as a time series, where a particular experience can be visualised by the intensity of pain at each point in time. This tracks the evolution of a pain experience over time. If you add up the time spent at each intensity level of pain, you get the Cumulative Pain for each intensity level.

""Pain"" is defined broadly to mean any negative affective state, so it can include physical pain as well as psychological pain (e.g. fear, anxiety, frustration).

Cumulative Pain and Pain-Track consider four categories of pain intensity: Annoying, Hurtful, Disabling, and Excruciating. We give the full definitions of these categories in the table below. The four categories were ""grounded on (evolutionary) principles that should be common to most pain experiences: the disruptive character of the pain experience and its effectiveness to promote adaptive behaviours."" The authors give evolutionary and physiological reasons to justify why ""more unpleasant sensations should be in general more disruptive"". The names of the categories themselves are chosen to ""evoke an empathic appreciation of intensity"". Though the authors give four categories, they point out that these could be divided into even more categories in the future.

This definition of pain, and the four categories, provide a common biological meaning that allow comparisons to be made between different species and different interventions. Likewise, the framework allows pain to be considered for both an individual animal and a population (by considering the prevalence of a particular welfare issue, or the scale and reach of a particular campaign).

The authors say that it might be possible to combine the categories of pain into a single metric, but  ""such an exercise requires understanding the numerical relationship among the intensity categories in terms of the aversiveness they cause: how much worse is the hurtful experience compared to an annoying or disabling pain?; or how long should an individual endure an annoying pain to make it equivalent to a few minutes of excruciating pain?"". Therefore, the authors do not attempt to combine the categories of pain in this way—but we do.

In the same way, the authors mention pleasure, but they point out that incorporating pleasure is  ""hindered by the challenges to establish the equivalence between positively and negatively valenced states (e.g., how much time of pleasure would be necessary to compensate an hour of torture-like pain?)"". The authors do not attempt to incorporate pleasure—but we do.

Like any framework, Cumulative Pain and Pain-Track have limitations: ""noise, biases and confounding factors will blur access to a realistic and accurate depiction of the pain experience"", and the validity and reliability have yet to be tested. In fact, the numbers assigned using this framework to a particular experience should be considered as an initial hypothesis, which ""can be made more precise as knowledge becomes available, or [...] challenged"".",24

Most people do believe that, all else being equal, more pleasure is a good thing. Many experiments have shown that farmed animals often pay a cost in exchange for pleasure, suggesting that some forms of pleasure might outweigh, at least, some mild forms of pain. So, it is reasonable to expect that there might be some moral value to pleasure, even if this is not necessarily guaranteed (see next section for more details on these trade-offs).",29

For example, one worldview might be ""pleasure and pain both matter"", while a different worldview might be ""only intense pain matters"". You can typically arrive at a particular worldview from a variety of initial philosophical positions and/or empirical hypotheses.

When we say ""philosophical position"", we mean one of the formal positions that have been defined in the academic literature in philosophy. For example, we think of traditional utilitarianism and negative utilitarianism as two philosophical positions.

When we say ""empirical hypothesis"", we mean a view about how the world works. Empirical hypotheses in this context might relate to how the brain processes positive and negative experiences, or about whether particular experiences are common in the world.

When we say ""a set of weightings"", we mean a collection of numbers that defines how a worldview might make numerical tradeoffs between different intensities of pleasure and pain, using the categories defined above.

For pain, we construct our weightings using disabling pain as the baseline. For a particular category of pain, if we assign some number X to that category, then we are saying that preventing X hours of pain of that category and 1 hour of disabling pain are equivalent. For example, placing a weight of 10 on the Hurtful category would be saying that preventing 10 hours of Hurtful pain is morally the same as preventing 1 hour of Disabling pain.

In the same way, for a particular category of pleasure, if we assign the weighting Y to that category, then we are saying that causing Y hours of pleasure in that category and 1 hour of pleasure in the Delightful category are equivalent.",43

(Note: Knutsson emphasises that this is one possible definition of traditional utilitarianism, not the only one.)

Absolute negative utilitarianism: ""Only suffering counts."" (Note: This also includes lexical negative utilitarianism, under which suffering and happiness both count, but no amount of happiness can outweigh any amount of suffering. For our purposes, these views are basically the same, because our research aims to advise funding decisions, and any money spent on improving happiness is money that is not spent on reducing suffering.)

Weak negative utilitarianism, or negative-leaning utilitarianism: ""Suffering and happiness both count, but suffering counts more. [...] perhaps some nonlinear function which shows how much happiness would be required to outweigh any given amount of suffering."" We do not consider this philosophical position further—in the context of animal advocacy, where very few interventions focus on generating happiness rather than preventing or alleviating suffering, we feel that this worldview would not add much useful information beyond that contributed by the above two worldviews.

Additionally, many people think that the most urgent thing is to reduce the suffering of the worst-off—for these people, preventing suffering is always more important than creating happiness, and preventing extreme suffering is always more important than preventing mild suffering. We consider this to be an additional worldview because there could be many philosophical and/or empirical positions that lead to this type of worldview, some of which are described by Animal Ethics (16). This type of worldview can give us a few sets of weightings depending on a) where we draw the line between mild and extreme suffering, and b) how much we weigh different intensities of extreme suffering. We don't want to get hung up on the precise philosophical definition of this worldview— this is more just a matter of practical application. That is, under this view, extreme suffering is so widespread that the distinction doesn't matter for practical decision-making in 2024.",45

We are aiming for a level of accuracy that is comparable to other, similar frameworks—that is, sufficiently accurate for us to make the best possible decisions about animal advocacy campaigns given the available information. In animal advocacy (and, indeed, in any field), policy decisions are typically hindered by information availability.

Most of the general limitations raised by Holden Karnofsky (37) and Saulius Šimčikas (38) also apply to our framework, and we encourage you to read those articles if you would like more details about those limitations.

The most pernicious limitation, in our view, is how we address indirect effects—that is, any impact of an intervention beyond what we can capture in our framework or model. These are sometimes known as flow-through effects, knock-on effects or second-order effects, though these terms can also mean different things. Flow-through effects are critically important to understanding the effects of any policy on the lives of both animals and humans (39–43). But flow-through effects are also relevant to all policy in all fields, having been analysed in energy efficiency, criminal behaviour, and pandemic preparedness, just to name a few (44–46). When it comes to accounting for indirect effects in decision-making, there is no single, universal method. The way that we will account for indirect effects will depend on the context, and may even vary between interventions, but typically we will consider many different qualitative factors and focus on robust interventions (39,42).",94

In Campaign X (trilobites), we would lobby local governments to treat ocean-polluting wastewater, thus improving water quality for wild trilobites living on the coastal sea floor. Trilobites are extinct sea creatures somewhat similar to crabs or insects. In Campaign Y (dodos), we would conduct outreach to farmers in the dodo farming industry, helping them to reduce dodo stocking densities and provide environmental enrichments. Dodos are extinct, flightless birds.

Second, for each campaign, we calculate the cumulative time in pain that would be prevented for an animal affected by the campaign, and the cumulative time in pleasure that would be created. These estimates could be derived from a variety of sources, such as scientific literature or expert judgement. In section 2 of the table below, we give our pretend estimates of the average time in pain prevented (and pleasure created) for each animal affected by the campaign. These estimates relate to the change in pain (and pleasure) across the entire lifespan of the average individual affected by the campaign.

Third, we multiply these numbers by the reach of the campaign (i.e. number of animals who would be directly affected) to calculate the total cumulative time in pain prevented, and pleasure caused, by the campaign. In section 3A of the table below, we give our pretend estimates of the number of animals who would be affected by the campaign for each year that the campaign runs. In section 3B of the table, we multiply the time per animal by the total number of animals to give the total number of hours of pain prevented (and pleasure caused) by the campaign for each year that the campaign runs.

These crop up on the rare occasions when the policy agenda and the specific makeup of the legislature provide a window for an animal party to secure large policy concessions from other parties. Examples include major policy changes (e.g. inclusion of fish in animal welfare laws or bans on widespread farming practices like beak trimming) or allocating millions of dollars for animal welfare in national budgets.

Small policy wins, which seem quite common. Examples include policies that benefit small numbers of animals (e.g. bans on particular types of hunting, restrictions on animal experimentation).

Shifting the political agenda and influencing the policies of other parties. This effect is notoriously difficult to measure, though it does seem to be positive and meaningful.

Capitalising on the non-legislative benefits of being an MP. This can include joining parliamentary committees, using the public stature of an MP to gain media attention for animal issues, and using allocated budgets to conduct campaigns outside of parliament.",3

There are numerous jurisdictions around the world where parties can win seats with modest votes like this. We believe that these jurisdictions are low-hanging fruit. Forming parties and contesting elections in these jurisdictions would result in animals gaining representation in a number of additional legislatures. There is less evidence that animal parties can readily expand their vote through advertising - instead, it appears that animal parties are mainly supported by a small core of passionate voters, and that the vote will therefore remain somewhat steady at around 0 - 3% over time. So, we think that the most important consideration is not necessarily advertising or crafting a perfect campaign strategy, but rather picking the right elections to contest, i.e. running in elections where parties can win seats with just a couple of percent of the vote.",4

This approach is difficult to scale as it is limited by the availability of legislatures where seats can be won with just a few percent of the vote. However, given the low costs, the positive impact, and the opportunity for occasional big wins, we think that helping animal parties contest additional elections would be a great part of the movement's portfolio.",14

A few parties have won seats at the national or regional/state levels (see table below). There have also been some successes at the supranational level (European Union) and the local level. When an animal party wins seats, it can influence legislation, which can be a major opportunity for policy influence. It is typically unrealistic for minor parties to implement their own legislation. Parliamentarians can also use their status to gain attention for issues, such as in the media or by building coalitions with other parliamentarians from other parties (1).

Policy concessions. For example, we illustrated in a previous article how the animal party in Australia can secure pro-animal policies from the government simply by running in elections (2). The election summarised in that article used preferential voting, in which a voter casts their vote by ranking the available candidates. This allowed the animal party to obtain policy concessions from one of the two major parties in exchange for having the animal party's voters rank that party above the competing major party when voting.

Agenda-setting. For example, the animal party in the Netherlands ""did not seek to implement its own animal welfare proposals directly, but rather it sought to make established parties work harder on animal issues through their participation in elections and in parliament"" (3). Influencing the agenda may be easiest for parties that can win seats, though parties can achieve some influence over the agenda simply by being very active during elections (2).",50

We can illustrate using an example from outside animal politics. The Australian 2010 federal election resulted in two MPs striking the jackpot - the election resulted in a hung parliament, where the balance of power during the formation of government was ultimately held by just two independent MPs. These MPs found themselves in a position where they were being courted by the two major parties (which were hoping to form government) with major policy initiatives, high-value development projects in the MPs' districts, and even an offer of a Ministerial position (4,5). If an animal party MP found themselves in this position, the policy impact for animals could be transformative. On the other extreme, there are cases where a government commands a majority of seats, meaning that a single seat held by a minor party would be of little relevance.",57

Furthermore, whether an elected animal party finds itself in a powerful legislative position or not, merely holding membership in a legislature can also allow a party to exert policy influence through other means. One such means is sitting on parliamentary committees. For example, a Member of Parliament from the Animal Justice Party in New South Wales, Australia was the chair of the Select Committee on Animal Cruelty Laws (and a member of many other committees). Another way to exert policy influence is by capitalising on the public stature, staff budgets, and travel rights that come with being an MP. People elected to legislatures can use the profile and resources associated with this position to draw attention to their issues. This was exploited by one early legislator from the Australian Greens, who ""for most of her time in parliament concentrated on the outside world"", attracting substantial media attention to her chosen issues (1). It is easy to see how a legislator from an animal party could substantially magnify the attention given to, say, undercover investigations on factory farms.",58

These are also called ""winner-takes-all"" systems because the most popular major parties (typically two major parties) win almost all of the available seats. The percentage of seats won by the major parties typically exceeds their combined percentage of the vote. An example of a majoritarian system is First-Past-the-Post as used in the United States Congress. Importantly, we consider some preferential voting systems to be majoritarian, an example of which is the Instant-Runoff Vote used for the lower house in the Australian Parliament.

Proportional systems. These systems distribute seats to parties roughly in proportion to the share of the votes that the parties received - a party receiving 10% of the vote can expect to receive about 10% of the available seats. There are a few different mathematical formulae used to distribute the seats. Some jurisdictions have a minimum threshold that parties must surpass before receiving any seats (e.g. 5% of the vote).",62

We do note that, for the purposes of this report, we treat some ni-ni systems as proportional systems (e.g. mixed electoral systems in which voters ""cast separate votes for two sets of seats allocated by different systems, most commonly single-member plurality and proportional representation""; and proportional with majoritarian incentives, in which ""other electoral rules give incentives to support larger parties"" (6)).",63

Historically, minor parties in majoritarian systems have been most successful when they focus on issues specific to one region, ethnicity or demographic, enabling a minor party to receive high support in a small locality (6,9,10). This effect is magnified in federalist countries: the existence of provincial legislatures ""provides a power base for minor parties that can then be used as a platform for national office"" (11).

Anti-establishment parties. When voters feel discontent with established parties and frustration at the lack of options, they often express this dissatisfaction by voting for particularly radical minor parties. However, for minor parties to pursue this strategy, they must have policies sufficiently radical that they cannot be co-opted by major parties (e.g. extreme right-wing populism). This means that minor parties may have success where they can a) establish an ideology that is sufficiently distinct and radical to avoid being co-opted, and b) run on an anti-establishment platform to capture dissent in the population (8).

Centrist parties. Centrist parties can act as a reasonable alternative to the major parties when voters are dissatisfied with the major parties. In particular, Quinn (10) shows that minor, centrist parties are most successful in electoral districts where one major party is highly dominant and the other major party is weak - this enables the minor party to appear as viable as a major party and therefore benefit from tactical and protest voting in those districts. This dynamic is specific to centrist parties.",68

While certain demographics tend to be more supportive of animal welfare than others (12,13), the baseline support for animal parties is small (typically a few percent of the vote), so any correlation between demographics and support for animal welfare is not strong enough to concentrate potential supporters of an animal party into a specific electoral district.

Animal parties are not really radical. While animal parties often propose some radical policy measures (e.g. the abolition of animal agriculture), animal welfare is not radical as a general topic. This means that major parties, if they feel threatened by an animal party, can safely adopt pro-animal welfare policies and therefore co-opt animal welfare as an issue (2). This means that animal parties cannot cultivate an identity that is truly and stably distinct from major parties (8). We will return to this point, as pressuring major parties into adopting pro-animal welfare policies often represents a major win in its own right. (Related to this point is the fact that radical minor parties can have animal welfare as one policy among many (14), though these parties are not really animal parties.)

Animal parties are not really centrist. Animal parties are typically associated with left-wing and/or green politics. Notably, some animal parties are not left-wing but are single-issue (15) or even right-wing (e.g. Italy's Animalist Movement, which is not to be confused with Italy's Animalist Party). Animal welfare does attract the support of right-wing parties in some countries (e.g. the UK).

This belief has empirical support in some (but not all) academic studies (16–18) and in the observation that mainstream parties almost always spend lots of money on advertising during election campaigns (though that latter observation does not necessarily prove that such spending is an effective use of money) (19). On the other hand, there has been no analysis specific to animal parties, and relatively few analyses specific to minor parties.

The Party for the Animals in the Netherlands has witnessed a vote that is steadily increasing over time. This suggests that animal parties can increase their vote by building their popularity and profile, and advertising may be one component of this. On the other hand, there is an alternative explanation. Dinas et al (20) show that when small parties enter a legislature, they typically experience a subsequent increase in their vote because having an elected parliamentarian ""signals organisational capacity and candidates’ appeal, and reduces uncertainty about parties’ ideological profile"". So, the increasing profile of the Netherlands may not necessarily be related to any actual marketing.

In Australia, the Animal Justice Party observes higher votes at election booths where party volunteers hand out flyers to voters as they arrive (2). On the other hand, this may be correlation rather than causation - perhaps naturally higher support in a particular suburb means that there are more people willing to volunteer for the party. Also, it is unclear whether volunteers handing out flyers on election day would have the same effect as paid advertising (e.g. on social media during the election campaign).",76

One view that is common in the academic literature is that minor parties tend to attract a core of voters who are committed for ideological reasons. For example, Adams et al (21) conclude that minor parties can maximise their votes if they ""maintain their policy appeal to those core voters who are drawn to them for ideological reasons"". For animal parties, this would be a small core of voters who are already strongly committed to animal rights or welfare. Securing votes from other groups of people may be less tractable. Under this view, it is far more important whether the animal party has policies that appeal to this core of voters - in this case, the party simply being on the ballot may be all the advertising that is needed to win the support of this committed core. Whether the voter sees an advertisement for the animal party may therefore be less relevant. 

Votes for existing animal parties are mostly capped within a narrow range (see data in ""5. Expanding Existing Parties""). It is common for animal parties contesting proportionally-represented elections to receive votes between 0% and 4%, but anything above this is quite rare. This suggests that, at the most, advertising can help within this narrow range, but perhaps not above it.

The academic literature has found that, in general, advertising ""tend[s] to produce small average effects"" (19). Even if the effect of advertising is above zero, it may be small.

In one election in Australia, the animal party invested a high marketing spend, but received a much lower vote than expected (2). On the other hand, this is a single data point, and it is impossible to tell if the vote would have been even lower without the advertising.",78

For proposing legislation, this is most successful when Hurst can identify which government MPs may be most sympathetic to the proposed law, as those MPs can then advocate for the proposed law within the ruling party. In other cases, Hurst has proposed legislation and launched a strong media campaign. If there is sufficient support for the proposed legislation among the Legislative Council and the public, the government is incentivised to propose a near-identical piece of legislation in the Legislative Assembly, which results in the success of the policy. Amending proposed legislation can also be a successful strategy, because if an amendment to a Government Bill is agreed to by a majority of members in the Legislative Council, the Government is forced to either accept that amendment, or they may not be able to pass their own Bill. In this way, passing an amendment to a Bill can convince the Government to come to the table and negotiate on an issue.

The biggest roadblock limiting Hurst's work is the power of the animal agribusiness industry and their lobby groups. Another roadblock is the fact that the animal welfare portfolio is under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Agriculture, which significantly hinders policy reform (see our detailed report on this challenge here). These two roadblocks make it very challenging for Hurst to secure ambitious, large-scale reforms for farmed animal welfare. Nevertheless, Hurst does campaign for some specific farmed animal welfare issues. Hurst sees value in the attention that these campaigns draw in both the media and in parliament, which can gradually help to build support among the public and other MPs in the long-run.

Hurst has no data on whether, or by how much, advertising during election campaigns helps the Animal Justice Party's vote. She does report that the party's vote has increased in New South Wales over time. She also feels that advertising for specific campaigns has directly led to policy wins in those campaign areas before.

Hurst reports that being an elected MP is an enormous help in securing media attention. She now finds it much easier to get stories into the media than in her previous roles in animal advocacy organisations.

When asked if she would like the animal advocacy movement to do anything differently, Hurst spoke strongly about the movement's need to become more involved in political lobbying. Hurst has witnessed a disproportionately low amount of lobbying for animal issues compared to other issues in Australia. This is true for lobbying legislators to both propose pro-animal legislation and support pro-animal legislation proposed by other legislators. Hurst hopes this trend will change with the establishment of the new Australian Alliance for Animals, who have a focus on political lobbying.",143

Passing any proposal requires discussions with the other parties to ensure support before the text is written. (This point may seem trivial to European readers, but in many majoritarian, two-party systems like Australia, it is extremely rare for a bill to pass unless it was submitted by the government.)

When we asked about Austraet's concrete policy wins, the two main examples she cited were: a new law that bans the capture and killing of wild pigeons; and a resolution to ask the minister to pressure EU policymakers to ban long-distance transport of farmed animals.

However, Austraet independently made the point that her most significant work is to simply raise animal welfare and veganism as issues in Parliament. Raising animal issues on the agenda makes them more legitimate as issues and encourages the other deputies (and the Minister) to shift in the right direction over time. Austraet felt strongly that while this effect is difficult to measure, it is real and important.

Austraet emphasises that it is essential to develop good relationships with other parties and with the Minister responsible for animal welfare. In particular, being an independent deputy enables Austraet to develop these relationships without the interference of a party label or a party apparatus.

Austraet has encountered a few key roadblocks during her term as a deputy. 1) Firstly, the Minister responsible for Animal Welfare has a large amount of control over the details of animal welfare laws and even how proposed laws are discussed. 2) Secondly, the Minister has stated that he will soon release a new, overarching welfare code, and many parties are reluctant to support Austraet's proposals while the details of the Minister's code remain unknown. This compounds a general reluctance from the other deputies to support animal welfare reforms. 3) Thirdly, Austraet is part of the opposition, rather than the government coalition. The first of these roadblocks (1) is a specific feature of the Brussels political system. The second (2) and third (3) of these roadblocks are specific features of the current policy agenda and makeup of Parliament, and may not necessarily interfere with progress in future sessions of Parliament.

Despite these roadblocks, we discussed with Austraet the role of party politics in animal advocacy in general. At the end of our interview, Austraet emphatically argued: ""People in animal welfare should really go into politics. [...] We have to be there.""",146

REV has made progress in the abolition of bullfighting and intends to complete this campaign to abolish bullfighting in France.

REV's main strategy involves disseminating information, argumentation, and public education, which they see as the only way to convince politicians and citizens to listen. REV also unites with political partners, such as the left-wing party La France Insoumise (also part of NUPES) to make short-term progress. For example, the alliance with La France Insoumise is an important part of the campaign against bullfighting.

The main roadblocks facing REV is the lack of financial resources. Other roadblocks include the power of lobbies, certain government policies perceived as anti-democratic, and negative media coverage of the far-left (by political opponents).",149

The vote is unlikely to decline, so a party that is elected once will probably be elected again.

Whether a party can achieve big policy wins depends on the context, makeup of the legislature, political agenda, and so on. These are somewhat rare. We assume that a big policy win would have an impact similar to a one-off welfare improvement for one group of farmed animals in a medium-sized country (e.g. banning mutilations for pigs; banning a particular slaughter method for fish; reducing stocking densities for chickens).

Small policy wins. Parties will usually, but not always, be able to achieve smaller policy wins. These are more common, but affect smaller populations of animals. We assume that a small policy win would have an impact similar to banning the hunting of one group of wild animals in a medium-sized country (e.g. capturing and killing pigeons; hunting pheasants).

Extra funding in the government budget. A couple of animal parties have been able to secure funding for local animal welfare organisations during the negotiations that set the government budget (e.g. ~$10 million USD in Portugal; ~$3.5 million USD in Australia). While these are large sums of money, they are typically limited to local organisations focused on companion animals.",174

Holding a seat in a legislature causes a significant increase in the salience of animal issues both in the legislature and in the media. This means that both policymakers and the general public pay greater attention to animal issues. As Victoria Austraet in Belgium emphasised during our interview, we expect that greater salience would cause more pro-animal policies to be passed over time, but this effect is long-term and notoriously difficult to measure. For salience in the legislature, Otjes et al (3) calculated that the entry of the Party for the Animals into the Netherlands legislature caused the amount of discussion on animal issues to roughly triple. For salience in the media, the Australian Animal Justice Party legislator Emma Hurst confirmed in our interview that, since being elected to parliament, it is much easier to get media attention for her campaigns. 

Long-term policies. Parties often succeed in passing policies that make institutional or political conditions more favourable to future animal advocacy, but it is difficult to measure the impact of these policies in the short-term. Two examples are: 1) Emma Hurst secured from the New South Wales government the creation of an Animal Welfare Committee, with herself as the Chair; and 2) Victoria Austraet in Belgium passed a resolution that pressures the minister to, in turn, pressure EU policymakers to ban long-distance transport of farmed animals.

In most cases, the animal party will also deliver longer-term benefits, such as improving institutional conditions for future advocacy and increasing the salience of animal welfare among the policymakers and the public.

The authors examine the voter niches to which each type of party appeals, using the cases of the Netherlands and Germany. They find that green parties appeal to voters ""from the traditional Green niche: those with egalitarian, cosmopolitan, environmentalist, and libertarian values."" In contrast, animal parties appeal to a different type of green voter, those who have ""significantly less cosmopolitan and evinc[e] lower levels of political trust"" and those who ""take more extreme positions on animal issues"".

Otjes (3) traces the history of the animal party in the Netherlands, Partij voor de Dieren. The author argues that the party's creation seems to have caused a marked increase in the political salience of animal welfare and agricultural issues, even among other parties.

Otten and Gremmen (35) also examine Partij voor de Dieren in the Netherlands, with a particular interest comparing how the party addresses issues relating to domestic animals to that of wild animals.

Morini (15) examines animal parties in the European Union's Member States. The author summarises the policy platforms of these parties and argues that animal parties constitute a new party family. The author points out that the seven parties under study can be classified into three categories: single-issue parties; parties which also include green issues; and parties with broader, left-wing policies.

Abbey (22) conducts interviews with members of Australia's Animal Justice Party. The study focuses on questions of gender in politics, showing that feminist ethics of care are highly relevant to members' support of the party. The author also explores the role of women and men in animal parties.

In a subsequent paper, Abbey (36) analyses the views of members of Australia's Animal Justice Party on veganism. Abbey points out that ""a political party that appealed only or even primarily to vegan voters could not garner a very large proportion of the overall vote. Although Australia’s vegan population is growing, it is only around 2%."" While almost all of Abbey's interviewees identified as vegan, ""these party members exhibited a welcoming approach to nonvegan party members. This could, of course, be a pragmatic viewpoint from those who want the party to increase its electoral gains and thereby its influence on Australian politics and policy-making. However, what came through their answers was less a calculation about maximising votes and more akin to compassion and support for individuals who were learning more about animal suffering through their participation in the party and who would, hopefully, come to reduce or resist animal consumption.""

Lucardie (37) analyses the ideology of animal parties by examining parties' programmes from Australia, Britain, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Portugal, and Spain. The author concludes that the parties are moving past single-issue politics and ""developing a new ideology based on the core concept of compassion and adjacent concepts of equality, intrinsic value and interdependence.""

The dissertation by Sandler (31) describes, from the perspective of critical theory, the evolution of minor animal parties. They provide an overview of the academic research on minor parties, emphasising that these parties often emerge from social movements, focus on neglected issues, and are not easily located along the class-dominated left/right axis. They also provide a detailed analysis of Portugal's animal party (PAN) with emphasis on its evolution, platform, and many policy successes. These policy successes include successfully passed bills and securing millions of Euros for animal welfare in state budgets.

Backlund and Jungar (14) ask why the radical right cares so much about animals. The authors focus on a radical right party in Sweden and find that the party strongly supports animal advocacy for three main reasons: nativism (arguing that Swedes care more about animal welfare than non-Swedes), authoritarianism (stronger laws for animal cruelty), and populism (reforming laws to better reflect the will of the people). Radical right parties pursue a paternalistic agenda towards animals, which differs from the true animal parties (as we have defined them here) that pursue egalitarian and rights-based principles.

Oh (38) examines Partij voor de Dieren in the Netherlands. The author argues that the reason for the party's growth is that the party succeeded in mobilising antipathy against established politics via the issue of animal rights. The author also points out that the party is also presenting broader social and environmental policies, which risks the party's ability to maintain its identity.",192

That is, both minor and mainstream parties compete for which issues are on the political agenda in the first place. Voters support the ""most credible proponent of an issue"" that those voters care about. The author also argues that minor parties, even without any electoral success, can succeed in influencing policy by forcing mainstream policies to give attention to the minor party's issue: ""By adopting either an accommodative or an adversarial strategy, the mainstream party is prioritising the niche party’s issue dimension and including it within the mainstream political debate. [...] The 'success' of the niche party’s issue is distinct from niche party electoral success.""

Cowell-Meyeres (40) begins by summarising the literature on how minor parties can influence mainstream parties to adopt the minor parties' policy issues. The author then demonstrates this with a case study of women's parties: ""Merely the emergence of women’s parties can draw attention to women’s issues but where women’s parties win seats, or appear poised to win even a small number of seats, they can trigger a process of contagion. [...] Thus, women’s parties may be useful tools for women’s movements because they provide a means to expand the opportunities for the movements to pressure larger political parties."" The author also points out that social movements that establish political parties can ""gain institutional resources accorded to such parties and, thus, expand their repertoires of contention.""

Lindstam (26,27) addresses the long-standing observation that minor parties often receive better votes at subnational (e.g. local) and supranational (e.g. European) elections, rather than national elections. Using data from the UK and Germany, the author finds that voters are more likely to switch from mainstream parties to minor parties when those voters ""perceive a mismatch between the party they feel close to and the party perceived as best able to handle an issue of importance to them, as well as when they believe less is at stake and when they place much importance on an overlooked issue."" In other words, precisely because voters care less about subnational and supranational elections, voters use those opportunities to signal the importance of particular issues to mainstream parties by voting for minor parties focused on those issues. We find this quite interesting because agricultural policy in many countries is set at the subnational level (e.g. regional/state parliaments) or influenced by supranational policy (e.g. EU regulations).

Donovan (41), using data from elections in the Australian Senate (the proportionally-represented upper house), argues that minor parties take advantage of institutional conditions that favour them (e.g. when the quota necessary for winning seats is low) or when there is discontent with mainstream parties (e.g. economic downturn).

Gauja (42) provides an instructive case study of one successful minor party: the Australian Democrats, which was represented in Australia's national legislature from 1977 to 2008. The Democrats either held or shared the balance of power in Australia's Senate from 1981 to 2005, giving this party a powerful influence over legislation when bargaining with mainstream parties. Though the Democrats have since faced a decline, their legacy is concretely relevant to this day in Australian voters' expectations that ""there is an option beyond the major parties"" and that the Senate is an important forum for keeping the government accountable. We also note that the Democrats were led by a former minister from a mainstream party, which is consistent with broader observations about the importance of credibility and name recognition in electoral politics (24).

Basile (43) analyses the impact of a minor party on mainstream party strategies, using data from Italy. The results contrast with previous research (including some papers listed above): the author finds that ""niche party influence on mainstream party strategies is limited, at least when compared with the influence of other systemic variables"". The author finds, contrary to previous understanding, that minor parties can be launched with a focus even on issues that are already present in political debate. The author also highlights that minor parties can exercise influence through rhetoric; one Italian party ""introduced a new language into political debate [...] which has required rival parties to react by reframing and redefining these issues differently from the past.""

Dinas et al (20), using data from all democracies after the Second World War, show that when small parties enter a legislature, they can expect to experience a subsequent increase in their vote. This is because entering a legislature ""signals organisational capacity and candidates’ appeal, and reduces uncertainty about parties’ ideological profile"".

Farrer (44) further explores minor party performance in the context of national, supranational, and subnational elections. The author finds that results in subnational (e.g. regional/provincial) legislatures are correlated with subsequent national election results, suggesting that minor parties can build their support locally first before seeking representation in national legislatures. In contrast, the author finds that minor party performance in the European Parliament does not predict party performance in subsequent national elections.

Abou-Chadi (45) provides further nuance on how mainstream parties respond to the emergence of minor parties. Using data from elections in 16 Western European countries from 1980 to 2011 and focusing on green and radical right parties, the author finds the the strategic responses of mainstream parties ""vary with ideological position and the past electoral performance of the established parties."" In other words, a successful minor party will have different effects than an unsuccessful minor party, and right-wing mainstream parties will respond differently than left-wing mainstream parties. Minor parties are not always successful in placing their issue on the political agenda, as ""mainstream parties react strategically and assess the possible effect that politicisation of a certain issue will have on their future electoral performance."" The two major theories that have been explored in the literature - issue competition and spatial/left-right dynamics - are both important in explaining when and how mainstream parties respond to the emergence of minor parties.

Blings (46) looks at how the success of a minor party can be bolstered by the social movement from which that minor party originally emerged. The author argues ""that movement roots can help niche parties achieve both vote- and policy-seeking goals by keeping core issues salient, bolstering issue ownership and securing allies in civil society.""

There is also the question of how minor parties compare to interest groups (which can include charities and non-profit organisations). This question has been studied in the sophisticated and nuanced work by Farrer (47). Asking the question of when to form an interest group versus a political party, Farrer proposes a theoretical model and tests it using empirical data from the environmental movement. Farrer's model begins with the assumption that advocates are policy-motivated and are simply searching for the best way to pursue their policies. In contrast, mainstream politicians are motivated to win and keep office. Thus, under Farrer's model, advocates choose the strategy that sends the strongest electoral threat to politicians. This threat can be sent by forming a party or by forming an interest group (or by some other strategy, such as direct action) - these are substitutable strategies. The best option depends on institutional conditions, as institutions govern both how costly it is for advocates to pick a particular strategy and how costly it is for mainstream politicians to respond to that strategy. Farrer makes two points that are particularly illuminating. Firstly, the formation of interest groups and the formation of political parties are substitutable strategies. In other words, these are both potential pathways to the goal of policy influence. Secondly, the best strategy depends on the context, including the type of political system. Specifically, new parties tend to have an easier time in obtaining policy concessions where decentralisation is high (i.e., where political power is devolved to smaller units like regions) and corporatism is low (i.e., where governments more readily listen to smaller interests). Elections that use proportional representation make it easier for new parties to enter, but proportional representation also make it a bit more challenging for new parties to obtain concessions from major parties (as the major parties find it more costly to grant concessions).",194

The authors argue that these numbers are higher than for the Swiss electorate as a whole, citing previous studies.

Essentially, this approach involves forming a group of voters who are willing to vote for a particular party (e.g. in a two-party system, voting for one major party rather than other). This places pressure on politicians to adopt policies amenable to the voter bloc and makes it more likely for politicians with such policies to be elected.

In addition to the power of their votes, farmers have often been highly successful in lobbying efforts. Farmers often receive a large amount of subsidies, sometimes amounting to a significant proportion of the total income. One strength of farmers as a voting bloc may be their ability to get the public on their side. Farmers are typically perceived as trustworthy and virtuous. People also tend to find food to be emotionally significant and this may be turned into a kind of nationalistic drive to protect local agriculture producers (55). Additionally, governments may have an interest in having strong domestic production of agriculture to increase their food security in cases of disaster or trade disruptions.

This requires a level of political engagement and community participation that is rare. Even animal parties with large advertising budgets and a place on the ballot often have trouble building awareness among voters who are otherwise supportive.

Animal advocacy must be more important to the voter than any other political issue.

However, veg*ns and animal advocates usually care about many issues. Abbate (56) points out that ""there are several different motivations for becoming vegan that are compatible with speciesist attitudes, such as concern for one’s personal health and concern for the environment [...] Indeed, many people choose veganism or reduce their consumption of animal products even though they embrace speciesist ideologies."" This would indicate that it might not be common for veg*ns to be concerned for animal welfare, let alone willing to take political action on behalf of animals. As the author argues, ""only a small fraction of vegans participates in animal rights activism."" Even where a voter is explicitly anti-speciesist, they may also be passionate about other causes like environmentalism and so may not be a single-issue voter.

The voter must be happy to vote strategically, even for a party that they may otherwise dislike and even at the expense of voting for a party that is visibly aligned with animal advocacy (e.g. an animal party or a green party).

Wright (57) argues that veganism, as an ideology, ""does not constitute a unified social movement"". In the author's words, ""vegans tend not to constitute a unified group in possession of a cohesive ideological mandate; they tend not to be joiners.""

Furthermore, we have observed strong backlash from within the membership of centre-left minor animal parties when those parties reach public agreements with centre-right mainstream parties. This suggests that many voters who are supportive of animal advocacy are not willing to vote for a party that supports a different ideology to the voter.",210

We suspect that this is also true for animal parties, as many people simply like animals.

People who vote for minor parties as a way to express their dissatisfaction with the mainstream parties (protest vote). In Australia, which has preferential voting, there is a surprisingly high number of voters who give their first preference to the Animal Justice Party and their second preference to the minor party Shooters, Fishers and Farmers. It would be difficult to explain this behaviour as motivated by genuine and simultaneous support for both of these parties.

People who are indeed loyal to a mainstream party during national elections but vote for an animal party in sub- and supranational elections as a low-risk way of expressing their support for animal welfare policies (26,27).

Information exchange. Groups can provide information to politicians, encouraging politicians to either propose, support, or oppose a particular policy. This can involve reports, working papers, email lists, or events and seminars aimed at parliamentarians.

Agenda setting. Groups can make a particular topic salient, encouraging a legislature to focus on it. This can be achieved through a variety of tactics, including proposing motions and publishing press releases.",23

The groups are usually supported by outside actors (e.g. businesses, charities, NGOs) that often provide funding, staff, services, and other resources. External actors often create and support APGs as part of broader lobbying campaigns while acknowledging that APGs are not always the most effective way to achieve their goals. Notably, Thomas finds that these groups can help legislators obtain information and can influence policy. Professional lobbying consultants regard APGs as often less effective than other lobbying tools.

The book by Ringe et al (3) gives a general study of party groups (both APGs and SPGs) in legislatures around the world. From a sample of 45 democratic countries, the authors find that party groups exist in 25 countries. The authors argue that the main role of party groups is to build social networks between legislators, which in turn allows for greater information sharing for all members of a network. This information includes technical details about and impacts of policies, but also the preferences of other parliamentarians, their constituents, whether a policy can be challenged in court, and so on. Ringe et al demonstrate that there are cases where party groups in the European Parliament have definitely influenced the content of legislation, at times even drafting text and having parliamentarians successfully insert that text into legislation via amendments (3). Party groups appear most likely to affect legislation in the agenda-setting stage or early consideration and drafting stages. The voluntary nature of party groups means they are very diverse in how they run and operate - this also means that groups will vary in their level of policy impact.

The book by Hammond (5), is a comprehensive study of party groups (both APGs and SPGs) in national policymaking in the US. Hammond argues that party groups are an informal adaptation that allow legislators to deal with the increasing complexity of policy issues and greater contact with constituents and interest groups. Hammond argues that party groups can indeed shape the legislative agenda and influence policy.",26

Intraparty caucuses are one type of SPG, but they tend to be large and have broad policy agendas. The results are highly specific to the context of the US House of Representatives - the author repeatedly emphasises how the results are affected by the majoritarian legislature, political polarisation, the concentration of power in the hands of each party's elite, and the specific nature of the Republican and Democrat parties. So, it is unclear whether these results will generalise to animal welfare party groups in other jurisdictions. Drawing on interviews and more than 15,000 policy documents, McGee shows that SPGs in the US House ""provide a vital avenue for rank-and-file members to extract policy concessions from party leaders in a highly centralised power structure"". Influencing legislation throughout the legislative process, with interview respondents emphasising that ""earlier is better"", even though closed-door informal negotiations cannot be measured.

Clarke et al (7) test whether SPGs in the US enable legislators to advance their policy proposals more effectively. The authors find that SPGs can affect legislation in some situations. Specifically, they ""find robust evidence that factions in the minority party – and only the minority party – improve their members’ ability to advance their policy proposals. Such effects are large and extend even to the passage of high-profile substantive and significant legislation."" The authors find no such evidence for factions in the majority party, concluding that in a majority (governing) party, the party leaders have comparatively more power over the party members.

Zelizer (8–10) analyses ""the causal effect of information on legislators’ policy positions"". Zelizer uses field experiments in a US state legislature to test the influence of three types of information that are highly relevant to APGs: staff briefings, cue-taking, and group deliberation. Staff briefing ""increased cosponsorship by 60% above baseline rates"", and negative briefing reduced cosponsorship and voting support of bills. Taking cues from other legislators ""is nearly 80% as effective as direct briefings"". Deliberations within party groups ""increased both cosponsorship and roll call voting support"" and also reduces polarisation on a bill.

Subsequently, Zelizer (11) found that this additional support may carry over to similar bills introduced in the future, though this appeared to be limited to closely related bills (rather than all bills relating to a broad issue). Zelizer concludes with a view that is optimistic, if modest, about the effects of information on legislators' policy positions: ""Persuasion was robust when legislators were provided technical expertise about bills; it lasted for years and crossed over to bills with related content. Legislators did not respond to a meeting with a special interest by simply supporting all of their bills, nor to a poll of constituents by persistently changing their voting behaviour. This suggests that legislators are trying to learn about the content of proposals, recall what they are given, and rely on this information when deciding what position to take. It is a relatively sanguine view of legislative persuasion.""

Camp et al (12) also use field experiments to test whether providing information to legislators changes those legislators' policy positions. The results show that information changes legislators' positions when provided by legislative staffers, but not by lobbyists. The authors conclude that legislators are cautious when provided information by lobbyists, though it is also possible that the findings are attributable to the experimental design. For our purposes, it may be important to present and frame information in a way that appears trustworthy and appears buy-in from legislators, and repeated interactions through a party group is one way to accomplish this.",28

This excerpt was written in an email by an animal advocate running a CPG and also conducting more traditional forms of lobbying. They write that party groups ""are quite a lot of work to organise and maintain, and return on investment (in terms of policy influence and impact) is limited. They can be useful for relationship building and establishing the name and profile of the organisation that coordinates the group, but their effectiveness as a vehicle for policy change is limited. I think this is partly due to their bipartisan make up which can limit the types of issues the group is willing to engage on. That said, they can certainly still add value. Politicians love physical events and forums because they are more tangible and they can engage on a personal level. You could hold a physical event that attracts 30 people and it would have more impact on a politician than an online event that attracts 300. However, that needs to be balanced against the additional time and resources required for the physical event.""",29

This ban was applied from 31 Dec 2008 (26), though a voluntary ban had already been in place since 2002 (27). The problem facing policymakers was that some products nevertheless used cat and dog fur either unlabelled or mislabelled, with the main products being ""jackets and coats, scarves, neckerchiefs, key rings and skin"" (26). As part of the 2008 ban, the European Commission and some Member States provided resources for officials to use in identifying cat and dog fur. There are two main reasons we exclude this policy from our analysis. Firstly, the scale of the ban was quite small. For example, in 2010, Member States report that 67 consignments were seized at the border, and 40 consignments were seized in shops and retailers (26). Member States expressed concern that it was difficult to enforce the ban for products purchased from online retailers. Secondly, the ban was placed on fur produced from cats and dogs, but not from other animals. It is unclear if this ban would actually have caused fewer animals to be farmed for their fur. Rather, it is possible that cat and dog fur products banned from the EU were simply sold to other countries instead, or that consumers and manufacturers simply switched to fur produced from other animal species - this latter possibility is concerning, as farming smaller animals (e.g. rabbits) may mean that more animals were farmed to produce a particular quantity of fur. The European Fur Breeders Association reported that ""the ban did not have a negative impact on fur trade"" (26). Subsequent analysis showed that cat fur products were still being sold in the EU in 2017 (28). We suspect that a detailed analysis on this policy would reveal that the benefits for animals would have been small.",63

We concluded that this policy probably reduces a meaningful amount of suffering, but only for a small number of animals and only for a small proportion of their lives. Based on older 2016 data, the UK exports roughly 550,000 live animals to the EU each year (39). This excludes chickens. Exports to the EU account for about two-thirds of the UK's total live exports by value (39), so we could expect the total number of animals exported live by the UK to be around 800,000 per year. These figures are from before Brexit and could have changed since the UK left the EU. Live export numbers have decreased substantially over time (40). In more recent years, between 25,000 and 50,000 sheep and calves have been exported from Great Britain annually (41). It is unclear how much of this decrease is due to conscious policy change and how much is due to temporary administrative barriers resulting from post-Brexit trade negotiations. Live export numbers have decreased over time in other countries (e.g. Australia (38)). However, there is nothing to prevent the live exports numbers increasing once again, especially when border posts are in place in the EU.",78

A minority of animals may experience longer journey times. As such, a live export ban would probably prevent somewhere in the vicinity of 5,000 animal-years of suffering per year.

The precise impact will hinge on what future regulations are created as a result of this new law. The inclusion of decapod crustaceans and cephalopods as sentient beings will probably cause concrete improvements in the lives of these animals, as we concluded in our recent report on this topic (18): ""Though the sentience of decapod crustaceans and cephalopods has now been recognised, they are still not included in even the basic protections of the Animal Welfare Act, and they are certainly not protected by more detailed secondary legislation, such as a Code of Practice. This makes the recognition of their sentience relatively symbolic so far, but since this is a recent development, it will be important to see if they are later included in the Animal Welfare Act (2006) or other legislation, as the government-commissioned report recommends. [...] Also remarkably, as part of the UK recognition of animal sentience, an independent committee of animal sentience is to be established with the task of ensuring that other government departments pay due respect to animal sentience in their decision-making. The independent nature of this committee could be an asset, since it will make it less likely that it will be captured by industry interests. The government has said that sentience will not take priority over other considerations when formulating legislation, but this is still very significant. If properly implemented, this would make the UK’s recognition of sentience more concrete and less purely symbolic than any of the other cases we have discussed in this report.""",83

They argue that we should end all animal farming based on the implausibility of producing animal products in a way that does not involve suffering and because the consumption of meat may lead to judgements of animals as having less moral worth, potentially leading to us disregarding their interests in other ways (Reese 2018; Bastian et al. 2012; Vinding 2014; Ozden 2022).

These periods of much greater change occur when the interest groups supporting the change are able to shift the framing around the policy, as well as the understanding of it and the underlying culture (Baumgartner and Harris 2020). For example, currently the framing around animal agriculture could be said to be that it is natural, traditional, and wholesome, and with this dominant narrative, as well as the reluctance of government to address the status quo, change is unlikely.

Ballot initiatives are a form of direct democracy that are distinguished by both being created by the public and voted on by the public, unlike referenda which are voted on by the public but created by the legislator (Schukraft 2020). Ballot initiatives are not widely practised, with 24 US states and Switzerland being responsible for most of them. ",50

Finally, proposition 2 in California banned gestation crates, veal crates, and battery cages (Schukraft 2020). Meanwhile, Sentience Politics has been active in Switzerland. In 2016, they led a ballot initiative to require schools and town halls in Lucerne, Basel, Zurich, and Berlin to offer at least one vegan option per day. They are also currently working on a ballot initiative to ban factory farming in Switzerland and a ballot initiative to extend fundamental rights to primates in Basel (SP n.d., n.d.).",51

Anthis 2017) found that a total of 47% of the US public supported a ban on slaughterhouses (14% strongly agree, 10% agree, and 17% somewhat agree). If this is accurate it could be taken as strong support for pursuing bold ballot initiatives now, as Sentience Politics’ ballot initiative to ban factory farming in Switzerland (SP n.d.). However, the answers to the Sentience Institute survey are strongly at odds with this result, suggesting that public opinion is inconsistent, but overall not yet strongly favourable towards animals. As such, we think these survey results should be treated with extreme caution, though note also that a poll by Viva! in the UK found even higher support for banning factory farming, 85% (Viva! 2021).",52

Shriver (2009) proposes that this may be done through making “knockout animals”. That is, animals who have a gene involved in pain perception are knocked out, meaning that they do not experience the affective dimension of pain and therefore do not ‘mind’ the experience. Morphine has a similar effect in removing the affective component of pain experience, and pain blunted by morphine is typically regarded as morally unproblematic, though it is difficult to be sure that the same holds true for animals, who are unable to share details of their experience with us (Shriver 2009). Shriver argues that because the sensory component of pain would be retained, some protective behaviour would remain, which could allow the animals to avoid some of the injuries that they might otherwise experience, and so making the raising of these animals potentially economically feasible.

However, these are already greatly violated by the status quo that uses them for their flesh and causes them to grow unnatural proportions, in conditions that do not allow them to express their natures. Knocking out the genes responsible for pain would largely just be removing the suffering associated with this (Shriver 2009). Additionally, the idea of ‘naturalness’ is hard to define and it is hard to justify and reflectively endorse the moral importance commonly assigned to this term (Shriver and McConnachie 2018).

Some of these may come with welfare costs, for example if they prevent the animals from engaging in actions that they find naturally rewarding, though in the cases described above, given that horns and large portions of beaks are already regularly removed, the effect of the modification would largely just be to remove the great pain associated with these procedures. Having said this, one could reasonably argue that it is beneficial for the industry to solve these welfare issues in better ways that treat the underlying issues such as crowding, rather than modifying animals to fit terrible conditions in ways that reduce their welfare. These modifications would not reduce suffering as dramatically as knocking out pain genes, but they might still have a role to play (Shriver and McConnachie 2018).

Moreover, the lack of ability to experience physical suffering might give farmers the moral licence to treat them much worse, increasing the amount of psychological suffering (Wilkinson 2009). Though this cannot be ruled out, it appears as though the underlying circuitry is shared between mental and physical suffering, suggesting that knockout animals would not experience mental suffering. Though this is still not certain and some circuits, such as depression, may use different pathways (interview proceedings). One experimental data point that knockout animals would not feel psychological pain is shown in this passage: “Interestingly, studies have shown that that ablation of the anterior cingulate causes mother mammals to stop responding to the cries of their young, leading some researchers to suggest that the “neural alarm” system that underlies parental response was built off of the machinery for pain” (Eisenberger, Lieberman, and Williams 2003; Shriver 2009).

It can also be seen from the book Animal Machines (Harrison 2013), first published in 1964, which described the huge ethical issue of factory farming as it was unfolding. This concern therefore does not seem to have protected animals from the horrors of factory farming, and perhaps the higher level of concern for animals seen in modern times would not protect us from some new horror in our treatment of animals if it became economically profitable to do so.",104

For example, keeping animals with access to the outside, using animals that do not have genes that cause them to grow very quickly at the expense of their welfare, and not separating a mother dairy cow from their calves.

The principle is that even if these programs are beneficial, future reforms may not be and so it is worthwhile to impose costs on interest groups trying to control their behaviour. However, Francione maintains that all or virtually all welfare reforms reduce costs or can be easily compensated by shifting prices to consumers, so if this were true, animal advocacy organisations would pose no threat to the meat industry, now or in the future. If most animal advocacy organisations just function as consultants to the meat industry (as Francione claims in Francione and Garner [2010]), why would the meat industry have to fear further cost-saving suggestions? The industry also appears to spend a lot of time and energy resisting the campaigns of animal advocacy organisations and go to great lengths to belittle them publicly, it is implausible that they would do this just to preserve the principle that they should not be pushed around.

This is especially in the case of the Japanese Emperor since the restrictions that were imposed arbitrarily excluded wild animals and allowed meat consumption in part of the year, in addition to being handed down from above. These cases may therefore not represent strong evidence. Still, since a change in attitude can follow from a change in action (Bastian et al. 2012), we might still expect significant change from a prohibition that started this early.

However, only 1% of farms are inspected each year in France (approximately the same as the UK). Only  23% of these farms improved compliance rates when re-inspected, suggesting the French inspection regime had little specific deterrence effect. Similarly, a study in the UK found that farms poor for broiler welfare tended to remain poor, despite those farms being targeted for follow-ups (Mullan, Stuijfzand, and Butterworth 2021). Additionally, a study in the US found that of companies that were given a warning for violating the Animal Welfare Act, 86.5% continued to violate that Act (Winders 2018).

Based on this evidence, regulations based primarily on inspections and warnings appear to have a limited effect on specific deterrence for farms that were inspected.

Farms may lose their certification if they repeatedly fail inspection. This enforcement regime does appear to be associated with greater legislative compliance (Clark et al. 2016). Affiliation with one certification scheme lowered the percentage of farms that were non-compliant from 23.1% for uncertified farms to 11.6% for certified farms. Membership was also associated with fewer instances of directly observable ‘unnecessarily’ suffering, with results of 4.6% vs 3.1% respectively. These figures drop further for each additional certification scheme, with 8.3% and 2.5% for two and three schemes showing a dose dependent relationship.

Such crimes include theft, tax evasion, environmental offences or driving while drunk (Dölling et al. 2009).

However, there are two key reasons to be cautious in extrapolating these inferences. The definition of corporate crime used in the meta-analysis included all levels of employees and a diverse range of behaviours, though only crimes committed to benefit the corporation were included. In other words, these crimes are calculated risks performed by corporations acting with profits and costs in mind (Paternoster and Simpson 2017). Merely benefiting an individual employee was not counted as corporate crime. Secondly, as was expressed in one of our expert interviews, animal crime is extremely niche, and comparing animal crime to other areas of crime is inherently problematic. As such, we believe that it is only reasonable to extrapolate these findings to animal welfare non-compliances that benefit agricultural companies. We will not extrapolate these findings to non-compliances that result from individual employee motivations (particularly social or emotional problems), which appear to be common (see below, ""Why do people abuse or neglect animals?"").

In a review of the US environmental enforcement system, Rechtschaffen (1998) discussed a call to reform the system towards a more cooperative approach under the assumption that all firms were inherently motivated to comply (Rechtschaffen 1997). However, Rechtschaffen concluded from the available literature that the credible threat of meaningful enforcement provided by deterrence-based enforcement was essential to promote widespread voluntary compliance. Notable benefits of deterrence-based enforcement over cooperative approaches include more consistent treatment and less agency capture (see below, ""Effects on the future of the movement (regulatory capture)"". However, Rechtschaffen suggests that overall, an improved solution would be to integrate some of the most constructive features of a cooperative model within a deterrence-based system. Gunningham (2017) corroborates this conclusion, noting that the best results come from strategies which employ a judicious blend of persuasion and coercion, with the mix being adjusted to the particular circumstances and motivations of the entity that regulators are dealing with (Paddock, Markell, and Bryner 2017).

Cohen (2000) examined 11 studies evaluating the effect of methods used for environmental deterrence on various compliance and environmental outcomes (Cohen 2000). Industries included oil tankers, paper mills, and steel mills. Overall, these found that broad deterrence effects could be observed across industries for monitoring, inspections, and number of enforcement actions. However, there was no strong evidence for which of these was most significant. Gray (2011) found similar results in a U.S. regulatory settings (Gray and Shimshack 2011), concluding that monitoring and enforcement actions resulted in substantial specific and general deterrence, as well as significant reductions in emissions. However, when discussing the relative impacts of different regulatory tools Gray notes that ‘the literature suggests that the relative impacts of different monitoring and enforcement tools vary across pollution media, industrial context, and time period’.",36

Therefore, any recommendations for reducing non-compliance from the literature must be made from drawing inferences from other similar areas in criminal, corporate, or environmental law compliance. Within this, we see that non-compliance with animal protection regulations occurs for a wider variety of reasons on an individual and business level. The first is for individual instances of animal cruelty which occur more to due to negligence or strong emotions. For crimes motivated for similar reasons in the criminal deterrence literatures the effect sizes of all methods of deterrence tends to be small. This means some instances of individual cruelty are difficult to deter with marginal increases in enforcement. Instead, changes to broader social norms or improving working conditions are likely to have larger effects. ",38

There is general agreement from the criminal and corporate compliance research that increasing the likelihood of being caught has the largest effect on crime rates. This is particularly relevant in the corporate case where regulatory policy, such as inspections, were most effective in ensuring compliance. However, evidence from environmental law enforcement is more mixed with the most effective tool varying depending on the context. Generalising from this available literature to the animal setting, this relates most to the cause of non-compliance. Smaller farmers who are more likely to be in non-compliance due to ignorance or negligence may benefit more from a cooperative approach, while larger ‘rational’ firms may require a deterrence-based model to bring them into compliance. However, even then the most impactful enforcement mechanisms to improve on the margin is difficult to conclude from the existing evidence in environmental enforcement. ",39

One well-studied and controversial example of crop subsidies is the programme in the US - in 2021, the US government spent USD 100 billion on farm support, and that farm support made up over 10% of the total money earned by farmers (5). These types of support may be direct (e.g. cash payment) or indirect (e.g. keeping prices at some artificial level to encourage production). Subsidies also exist in wild-caught fisheries, where government support can make fishing more profitable than it would otherwise be (6).

The voluntary payments made by Member States are targeted towards dairy cows in most countries (21). This is at odds with the fact that, across the EU, farmed chickens, rabbits, and pigs are far more numerous (22,23).

For example, New Zealand's government was forced to eliminate agricultural subsidies in the 1980s because they had become too expensive (35), and Jordan's government was motivated to lift a feed subsidy in 2007 due to pressure on the national budget (43).

Subsidies for meat production generally have environmentally harmful effects. These effects can provide further support and justification to campaigns seeking to abolish these subsidies (35).

Some subsidy reforms are driven by pressures from the World Trade Organisation to reduce subsidies that directly support production. This was one motivation for a 2005 reform of EU-funded subsidies in the UK (44).

There are some examples of animal agriculture sectors in particular countries where most farms are economically unsustainable without subsidies. This appears to be the case for the goat sector in Greece and was also true of many farms in the UK in the early 2000s (44,45). Abolishing these subsidies could, therefore, cause major reductions in meat production. However, it is unclear whether governments would actually allow these industries to collapse in reality, as this would have profound implications for food supply and social well-being.

Abolishing meat production subsidies can cause harm to people. New Zealand's subsidy reform did bring some social costs - some farmers were forced to draw on social welfare payments and the populations in some rural towns were reduced, although these both occurred less frequently than what was predicted (35). Tragically, there were also some suicides (35). In Jordan, the removal of the feed subsidy caused harm to the livelihood of some disadvantaged groups (43). Where subsidy reform risks causing harm to people, it is critical for reform to be accompanied by transitional assistance from the government to prevent this harm (35,43). The money that the government saves could also be spent on helping people in other ways.",101

We find that there is insufficient evidence to break down overall policy success into the baseline rate of success and the counterfactual impact of lobbying. There is only a single study that identifies the counterfactual impact of lobbying. That study was limited to a single policy issue and a single context, and so its findings need to be replicated across other issues and contexts before we can draw any sound conclusions.",4

Many of these forces are inherently unobservable (de Figueiredo and Richter 2014).",26

The status quo is strong, and lobbying to change it is difficult (Lowery 2013). There are several reasons for this: policymaker attention is scarce; lobbyists in favour of the status quo can effectively raise general doubts and fear of costs associated with change; the difficulties in creating bipartisan coalitions; the interests that gatekeepers have in maintaining existing policy; and the idea that the status quo already reflects the relative abilities of competing lobbyists (Baumgartner et al. 2009). Lerner (2020) concludes that lobbying for the status quo is more likely to succeed than lobbying against the status quo. Lerner also proposes a way to take advantage of this phenomenon by lobbying to retain beneficial policies that already exist. Relatedly, one study found that lobbying against a proposal is more effective than lobbying for a proposal (McKay 2012a). However, this may be an artefact of studies failing to consider the counterfactual. If the status quo is likely to remain, then lobbying in favour of the status quo might make no difference. In this case, a small amount of lobbying might appear to have a very high probability of success, making lobbying in favour of the status quo appear more effective than it is. Separately, businesses are more likely than advocacy groups to lobby in favour of the status quo (Garlick 2016; Mahoney 2008). If businesses are better at lobbying than advocacy groups, this might confound the relationship between status quo and success, though we emphasise that we have seen no convincing evidence that businesses are better at lobbying than advocacy groups.",27

Theorists hold that there are several 'faces' of power (Lukes 2004). The first face of power is to do with who wins and loses on particular policy issues. The second face is to do with who can control the agenda on which those issues appear or do not appear. The third face is to do with manipulating the preferences of others, such as via ideology (Dür 2008a; Finger 2019; Dür 2008b). Through the second and third faces, many actors can exercise influence in a way that is totally invisible to researchers (Lowery 2013). For example, if an interest group wants to maintain the status quo, they may lobby to keep a potential reform off of the agenda. If this group succeeds, by definition there would be very little observable behaviour (Lerner 2020). Despite the importance of the second and third faces in understanding lobbying success, few studies have attempted to unravel these (Leech 2010), though some studies do exist (Pedersen and Binderkrantz 2014; Fellowes, Gray, and Lowery 2006; Garlick 2016; Binderkrantz and Rasmussen 2015; Yackee 2012).",28

Studies often only focus on one or a handful of these pathways, limiting researchers' ability to detect the full scope of influence. These pathways to influence include access (directly expressing information or demands to decision makers), selection (helping aligned people to win power by influencing the selection of politicians, bureaucrats, etc.), voice (the use of outside lobbying methods, including media statements, rallies, and petitions), and structural coercion (the ability of businesses to influence politicians with minimal or no effort because politicians are incentivised to create a favourable environment towards business). A business can also have substantial structural power due to the popularity of its products with consumers. When a product is perceived as important by consumers, the line between a business's commercial activity and political activity becomes blurred. In this case, deliberate activity like lobbying may not be a useful way to think about political influence (Woll 2019).",29

Another important reason is that lobbying happens over long periods of time, with earlier efforts affecting later efforts (Baumgartner et al. 2009; Sentience Institute 2020; Lowery 2013; Mahoney 2008).

This means that these studies can only make valid inferences about lobbying efforts that were attempted. However, research in effective altruism and policy often focuses on hypothetical lobbying efforts, some of which have limited or no precedent in public policy. Even if robust estimates of the base-rate of success of lobbying were available, it would not be clear that these estimates would apply to the hypothetical lobbying efforts that we generally consider.",32

One such researcher, Frank Baumgartner, compared lobbying to the weather. Under this analogy, lobbying research is more like climate science than weather forecasting: while understanding the complex dynamics at play is both possible and useful, giving point predictions is impossible (Sentience Institute 2020). A different analogy comes from Robert Salisury, who argued that we might as well ask, 'Who is the most influential member of the U.S. Senate?' or 'What is the influence rank among the Supreme Court Justices?'. In other words, since the success of lobbying depends so strongly on context, we are posing a question that is utterly meaningless (Salisbury 1994 cited in Leech 2010)",44

The judgement of people who are experts within a specific context and policy area. The key benefit of using these domain experts is that they often have on-the-ground expertise on particular policy issues. The principal weakness is that their judgement is unlikely to have been validated over many questions. We have also found that experts are often hesitant to assign specific probabilities, which may necessitate the use of qualitative categories (e.g. asking experts whether lobbying is likely to be very helpful, somewhat helpful, or not helpful). There are some systematic methods available for analysing expert judgement (e.g. Meyer and Booker 1987; Linstone and Turoff 1975).

Forecasts made by paid panels of superforecasters. The key benefit of using superforecasters is that their judgments have been shown to achieve a significant degree of accuracy over many forecasts (Tetlock and Gardner 2016). However, superforecasters are unlikely to have on-the-ground expertise on particular policy issues, so they might miss important factors.",66

We only considered estimates measured at the level of the organisational campaign. This is the specific combination of a lobbyist campaigning for a particular policy, sometimes referred to as the 'policy-lobbyist dyad'. This is because we were interested in the impact of lobbying on policy adoption. We did not consider estimates at the level of the policy (which would measure policy adoption) or at the level of the lobbyist (which would measure the success of lobbying over time). 

We only considered studies that gave a binary (dichotomous) measure of success. There are many good reasons to prefer measuring success along a continuous scale for lobbying research in general (see above section, 'Studying influence: Methodological challenges'). But we intend to apply our results in modelling potential lobbying campaigns, and a continuous scale is not suited to that context.

We only included studies that gave useful information on the probability of success given some lobbying effort (the output of lobbying). This meant that we excluded other questions, like access to politicians or the reasons why groups decide to lobby (the input of lobbying).

We only included studies that analyse democratic countries. While research on lobbying in non-democratic countries is an intriguing and useful line of inquiry (Weil 2018; Popović 2020), our focus as an organisation has generally been in democratic countries. There are likely to be different political mechanisms for animal advocacy in non-democratic countries (Chung, Anderson, and Li 2021; Wulderk et al. 2022), and different contexts and levels of success for lobbying in general (Uba 2009; Weymouth 2012). We classified a country as democratic if it was categorised as 'full democracy' or 'flawed democracy' in the 2021 Democracy Index (Economist Intelligence Unit 2022).

We only included studies published after the year 2000. This is an arbitrary choice, but one that saved substantial time by reducing the number of database results by 20%. We suspect that the results that this excluded are generally the least relevant, particularly as quantitative methods in evaluating lobbying have evolved over the last couple of decades.

We only include publications with full-texts in English. We believe that studies in languages other than English are likely to be useful. However, we were constrained by the time and language skills to find and evaluate such publications.

We did not include purely qualitative case studies on specific instances of lobbying.

We did not include theoretical modelling papers, like game theory studies or simulation studies.

We did not count direct payments of money (e.g. campaign contributions) as lobbying, following the definition of lobbying in de Figueiredo and Richter (2014).

We did not include studies where the person or group lobbying was a government or a government official. This mostly occurred where a local government lobbies a state or national government - this phenomenon is not relevant to our focus on lobbying by interest groups or grassroots campaigns. 

We did not include judicial lobbying. The context of judicial lobbying is inherently different from legislative and regulatory lobbying, and we rarely focus on judicial lobbying in our work.

We did not include studies where corporations lobby governments for contracts.

Any effect these actions have on the expected return through investment in the targeted companies is secondary to this. Nevertheless, shareholder activism would be a more sustainable and attractive approach if it ultimately has a beneficial or at least neutral effect on shareholder returns. If this were true, we would expect more people to be interested in engaging in shareholder activism. Additionally, if shareholder activism positively (or even neutrally) affects share valuation, it will be in the interest of firms to acquiesce to shareholder demands on purely financial grounds.",90

The first is shareholder activism to improve the functioning of the firm principally in order to increase profits, sometimes called financial shareholder activism. For example, if the CEO was performing poorly this form of shareholder activism could be done in order to force the hiring of a new CEO to replace them. The second type of shareholder activism is the type that we are concerned with in this paper, shareholder activism principally motivated for the public good which seeks to improve the moral practice of the company, sometimes called social shareholder activism (Goranova and Ryan 2014). Of course, there may not always be a clear line between these two forms of activism. Immoral practices by companies can often have a strong negative effect on the reputation at some point farther down the line.",91

Rafaqat et al. (2022) reviews the literature on shareholder activism between 2000 and 2021, analysing both financial and social shareholder activism. They find that it does affect firm valuation, but in inconsistent directions with some studies finding positive effects, others finding negative, and others finding minimal effects.

Dimson et al. (2015) analyses is a database of engagements with 613 US companies carried out by a single shareholder engagement firm in 1999 and 2009. They find that shareholder activism is associated with an increased return of +2.3% over the following year after engagement. They suggest that the reason that firms may not implement these reforms on their own without pressure is that these firms are targeted for their unusually weak governance, which makes reforms less likely.
