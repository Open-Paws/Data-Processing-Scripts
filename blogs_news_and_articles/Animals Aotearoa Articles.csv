The companies that have signed in Europe include Nando’s and KFC. They have recognised the need to make crucial improvements in the lives of the chickens they sell.",1

Some birds are already in pain from having legs or wings broken, or joints dislocated, during the catching and transport process.",3

Despite being one of the abnormally fast-growing breeds, she is one of the oldest living chickens bred for meat that we are aware of. Sadly ‘oldest’ when it comes to chickens bred for meat is just six years. Her body was designed to grow meat, rather than sustain life and as a result, she is about twice as large as her egg-laying sisters and needs regular veterinary attention.

Pou has been on heart medication for many years, and her biological clock is ticking fast. This doesn’t stop her from enjoying life to the full.",55

Campfire Treats follows in the paw prints of UK-based Beco Pets, who made the full switch to all their chicken meeting these higher welfare standards, back in 2020.

The Better Chicken Commitment is a set of science-based criteria that result in better welfare for chickens farmed for meat. It means a transition to using healthier breeds of chickens, kept in better living conditions. When food businesses sign up the Commitment, they specify the agreed future deadline by which all the chicken they use will meet the Better Chicken Commitment standards. Over 500, companies here and overseas have signed up to the Better Chicken Commitment.

It’s not just Campfire Treats and Beco Pets leading the charge. Viva Raw, Savage Cat Food, RAWR and Beast Feast are also committed to the Better Chicken Commitment, working towards meeting all the criteria by 2028, 2027, 2026 and 2024 respectively. Closer to home, Open Farm, which operates in Australia, Canada and the US will meet the criteria by 2026, showing that improving animal welfare is not just a trend – it’s a movement.

This raises the question: why are a whole host of human food producers, outlets and retailers, big and small, dragging their feet?

Where is the leadership from the poultry and egg industry bodies?
and
2. Why have they failed to help the farmers plan to prevent empty shelves?

Maybe these leaders are trying to shift the blame by, in the case of the Rural News opinion piece, putting supermarkets in the spotlight, because they feel they have egg on their faces. They have failed to effectively advise their members, the farmers, to invest in cage-free and free-range production. Ten years was long enough for the egg industry to transition, so why is the narrative that this isn’t their fault?",6

Is the same going to happen with chicken meat? Currently, the lives of the 120 million birds reared every year in NZ are full of suffering, primarily because of the unnatural breeds of chicken used. These are different to the breed of hen used by the egg industry. The birds farmed for meat grow so big and so fast that many suffer chronic pain and lameness. Some can’t lift their bodies up off the floor to reach food or water. Others struggle to breathe or suffer organ failure within weeks of being hatched. All because they’ve been bred to grow faster than nature intended. 

Innovative food businesses including HelloFresh, My Food Bag and Domino’s have signed up to higher welfare standards that will help give chickens farmed for meat, better lives and to banning the use of these unnatural breeds in their supply chains.

In so many sectors, Aotearoa is renowned for its innovation and forward-thinking. It certainly doesn’t seem that way for eggs and chicken meat. It’s like a company still using carrier pigeons to deliver their messages because their CEO thinks computers are unnecessary, new-fangled gadgets. A CEO who did that would soon be sacked by their Board of Directors. ",8

Advocacy charity, Animals Aotearoa, worked with HelloFresh to achieve this progress. HelloFresh’s commitment follows their overseas progress where they have already signed the Better Chicken Commitment in Europe and the United States.   
 
The Australia-New Zealand Better Chicken Commitment lays out strict, science-based standards for rearing chickens bred for meat; standards which far exceed those currently set by the New Zealand government. The ANZ Better Chicken Commitment is backed by 15 animal organisations including the New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), Veterinarians for Animal Welfare Aotearoa (VAWA), Compassion in World Farming and World Animal Protection.
 
Animals Aotearoa Executive Director, Marianne Macdonald, applauds HelloFresh for being an early adopter. 
 
“HelloFresh is showing leadership in the food business sector in not only using the best animal welfare practices available now, but also demanding better for the future.” 
 
“Kiwis don’t want to be sold cruelty. As a global business, HelloFresh recognises that the Better Chicken Commitment standards are quickly becoming industry standard for companies that care about animal welfare.”
 
“The Better Chicken Commitment will significantly improve how chickens are raised and slaughtered. Most importantly, these standards mean the farming of healthier, more naturally-growing chicken breeds on farms that provide more space per bird, perches to rest on and natural light.”  
 
“We urge other food businesses to follow the lead of HelloFresh and do the right thing for both chickens and for their customers.” ",1

Fishes form relationships both within their own species and with other species. They build complex social networks and communicate in a variety of ways including through body language, colour change and even vocally. Cod, for example, communicate with a series of vocalisations, thumps and growls made with their swim bladders, which they use as alarm calls, to attract mates and to establish territories. They have the ability to change the patterns of their sounds and use different frequencies, leading to a finding of regional accents with these fishes in the UK.",10

I kneel down to film – the ground is hot and spongy. My knee slides a little in the wetness. A chicken defecates right next to me, to remind me of what I’m kneeling in.

The floor litter is never changed in the lifetime of these birds, so it’s a thick hot layer of faeces from tens of thousands of chickens.

I notice a bird sitting underneath one of the pan feeders with legs splayed out. I immediately recognise this common sign of lameness. I’ve seen it so many times before. This chicken can’t stand, and will struggle to reach the feed. I sit nearby and watch. 

She spins around in frustration, her wings flapping as she struggles to get up. After a few attempts, she gets to the edge of the feeder and just reaches her beak over the edge, but can’t quite get to the feed. She gives up and collapses back down. I know she will likely die here, right under the food. I push that thought away as there’s work to do.

I think to myself, “How is this shit legal? These birds are going to lie here and die slowly from lack of food and water on the floor of this disgusting shed”. Anger rises, but again, I shut it down – I have to get on with my work. Focus. Focus.

Without even moving further into the shed I see another two birds with that same characteristic leg sticking out sideways. They are everywhere. It’s a defect in the genetics of the breed. The industry knows all about it – it’s just one of the many issues caused by growing birds far too fast and keeping them in industrial unnatural environments such as this. And this is a free-range shed, apparently ‘premium’ conditions.
​
If people saw this for themselves and understood what it means to live (and die) in these windowless barren factories, they wouldn’t buy products like this.
But maybe my expectations are too high. Who knows? What I do know is that chickens are sweet, curious, and intelligent, and a life like this is a shameful example of what we have done to animals for cheap meat.",5

I notice her blue eyes. She’s cautious, and I slowly reach out to pat her head, but she darts away – she doesn’t want a bar of it.

We finish up filming and I look back at that first bird sitting underneath the feeder, still sitting there, defeated. Briefly, it crosses my mind to take her out of there, stuff her in my jacket and give her a nice life for a little while. But I know the reality, I’ve been here before. These birds aren’t bred to live past six weeks. There are skilled people who would do their best for her, with a lot of resources, time and kindness. But she won’t live long. She will be in pain.

They are raised in large indoor sheds with only an about an A4 sheet of paper size per bird. A 2013 Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) report found over half of the chickens studied were unable to walk or move properly, with the implication that they were unable to fully access food and water. Problems also described in the report included joint infections, twisted legs and bone tissue death. And if this isn’t enough, the ammonia from their droppings burns into their feet and ankles joints.

These birds then get sent to slaughter at only around six weeks of age when they reach the weight of 2.5 kg, (although some are killed even younger). Handlers catch the chickens, dangling up to four in each hand by their legs and forcing them into small crates. Birds often suffer from dislocated hips, broken wings and legs, and bruising. Once at the slaughter house they endure the aforementioned shackles, electric current bath, electric cutter and boiling bath (to remove feathers).

While free-range certainly makes a huge difference to the welfare of pigs and hens used for egg production, it is a different story for chickens bred for meat.
​
Many Kiwis try to buy and eat free-range chicken meat. People want a good life for the animals they consume, but the reality for most chickens sold as free-range is a short life of suffering. Caring people are being misled into paying more for so-called free-range chickens who may never see the outside of a shed until they are taken for slaughter.",1

https://animalsaotearoa.org/2021/08/01/free-range-chickens-still-suffer/,Free-range chickens still suffer,,,,"There is no legal standard for free-range: all that is required is potential access to the outdoors. Chickens have an innate fear of open spaces (where predators can attack) and can be reluctant to go outside when the only option is a barren space, lacking shelter. This leaves these chickens crammed inside sheds, just like their non-free-range counterparts. Studies on the proportion of birds that go outside free-range sheds vary from 2 to 74%.  Even at the highest end of the scale, that’s one in four birds who spend their whole lives in a crowded shed, sitting and standing in excrement-soaked litter. ​",3

Even so, because they are still of a fast-grow breed, these chickens have restricted mobility and other health problems. Bostock is, however, looking to use a slower-growing breed of chicken who will have much better welfare.",4

​
The best thing you can do as an individual is to keep chickens, and all animals, off your plate. While people continue to eat chickens, however, the most significant change we can make to the welfare of chickens is to get better breeds. Then free-range really would start to be meaningful.",5
